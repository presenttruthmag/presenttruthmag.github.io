God has forgiven your sins! If ever there was one thing that was absolutely certain, absolutely true, it is that all your sins are forgiven. Where’s the proof that your sins are forgiven? How can we know it? The proof that your sins are forgiven was openly made certain and is promised to all the world because the Lord Jesus Christ, our Creator and Redeemer, has come to this Earth, lived an absolutely sinless spotless life, and then He died upon the Cross in your place for your sins so that you may be forgiven and be accepted and counted as if you had never committed one single sin in your whole life. <table><tr><td valign=top>Because Jesus was condemned for our sins, all of the human family has been acquitted of guilt before the throne of God. You have been found innocent at the judgment bar of God. In Christ there is no condemnation,  no guilt, no sin, no accusation, no death, no more nagging conscience. In Jesus Christ there is true freedom! This freedom also includes freedom from fear of death. Jesus Christ has arisen from the grave  and now He lives! And not only that; He promises that anyone who believes in His death for their sins will one day be raised from the dead and live eternally with Him forever. That’s right!! Those who put their faith in Jesus Christ have eternal  life!! Isn’t this Good News? It really is, isn’t it? God loves you and all of us so much that He came to Earth to die for our sins so that we might be forgiven and that we might have the promise of eternal life!</td><td align=center valign=top><IMG SRC="../graphics/tract1.gif" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=376 BORDER=0 alt="Cross and Ten Commandment Stones"></td> <BR></tr></table> <P>Will you believe in Jesus Christ as your Saviour from sin and as Lord of your life? What does it mean to have Jesus as the Lord of your life? It’s very simple! Just as Jesus has loved you and forgiven you, he asks you to love your fellow man and forgive everyone else where they have sinned against you. God has forgiven you! Will you accept your forgiveness and forgive others? God has loved you!! Will you love others as He has loved you? <BR> <P>

Let this short prayer be your prayer: "Lord Jesus, thank you for coming into this world to die upon the cross for my sins. Please forgive me for all of my sins and please begin to live in my heart as my Savior and Lord. Thank you for your promise of forgiveness and eternal life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."<BR><P>

Now that you have heard and believed the Good News about Jesus, why not tell everyone you know about His forgiveness and His love.<BR>  <P>If you have decided to believe in Jesus, why not e-mail us at <A HREF="mailto:ptruth@adelphia.net">ptruth@cox.net</A> right now.<BR> <P><I>Romans 5:8-11</I><BR> 8  But God demonstrates His own love toward  us , in that while we were still sinners, Christ died  for   us .  9  Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.  10  For  if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.  11  And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. <BR>&nbsp;<BR><P><table><tr><td align=center valign=top><IMG SRC="../graphics/tract1-1.gif" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=150 BORDER=0></td><td valign=top><P><I>John 3:16-18</I><BR> 16  "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.  17  "For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.  18  "He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <BR></td></tr></table><P><I>1 John 5:11-13 </I><BR>11  And this is the testimony: that God has given us  eternal   life , and this  life  is in His Son.  12  He who has the Son has  life ; he who does not have the Son of God does not have  life .  13  These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have  eternal   life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.  <BR> <P><I>1 Cor. 15:51-57 </I><BR>51  Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed--  52  in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last  trumpet . For the  trumpet  will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  53  For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  54  So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: "Death is swallowed up in victory."  55  "O Death, where is your sting?  O Hades, where is your victory?"  56  The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.  57  But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  <BR><br>
