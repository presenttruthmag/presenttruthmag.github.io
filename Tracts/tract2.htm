He wants you to know that all your sins are forgiven! God has forgiven you. God knows all about  you. He knows all about your fears and anxieties and regrets and how bad you feel about your sins, your failures, your shortcomings, and the many times that you’re tried to improve and change your ways but have failed. He knows how you are searching to find meaning in life. He knows that you are wondering about why all the suffering and pain exists in the world.<br><table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5 border=0><tr><td valign=top><br><img src="../graphics/galgotha.gif" width=200 height=172 alt="" border="0"></td><td valign=top>God has not forsaken you or turned away from you. God Himself has come down to this sin-sick, dreary world to call you to Himself and to save you out of the world. In order to save you out of the world, Jesus Christ the Creator of the world came here to suffer and die for you upon the Cross because He knows you and He loves you! Yes, Jesus knows all about our selfishness and our anger towards Him but yet, just as a loving father loves his wayward child, Jesus loves you and was willing to take the punishment and guilt for our sins and die in our place, for our sins. You have been forgiven because God Himself in the person of Jesus Christ loves you and gave Himself for you.</td></tr></table><br>Will you still continue to be angry with your heavenly Father? He has forgiven you. Will you be reconciled to Him? He is tenderly calling you back to Himself right now and is patiently, anxiously waiting for you to accept His forgiveness and come home to Him.<br><br>Jesus doesn't promise us that the life of those who follow Him will be easy. He says, &quot;In this world you will have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.&quot;<br><br><b>Yes!</b> Even though there are tears and suffering and death, Jesus has promised that one day soon He will put an end to all of the evil in this world.<br><br><table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5 border=0><tr><td valign=top>He has promised that one day soon He is going to make a new Heaven and a new Earth where there will be no more sickness, suffering, or death.

</tr></table><BR><B>Yes! </B>Jesus is calling you. Will you answer Him and pray, “Here am I, Lord! Remember this poor sinner when you come into your Kingdom.”<BR><BR><i>1 John 4:9-10</i><br>In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<br><br><i>Ephesians 1:7</i><br>In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace which He made to abound towards us...<br><br><i>Colossians 1:13-14</i><br>He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in Whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.<br><br><i>John 3:16-18</i><br>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already; because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.<br><br><i>1 John 1:7-2:2</i><br>But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us. My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous. And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world.<br><BR>Present Truth Magazine, P.O.
