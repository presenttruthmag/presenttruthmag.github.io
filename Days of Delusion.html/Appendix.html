<p class="style1"><strong>SYNOPSIS OF THE THEORY AND CALCULATIONS <img src="../archive/II/2-10b.gif" width="272" height="214" align="right"></strong></p>
<p class="style1">Daniel speaks prominently of 2300 days. He also has four numbers, namely, 1260, 1290, 1335 days, and 70 weeks (equal to 490 days). </p>
<p class="style1">Each of these days Mr. Miller considers a year: and it is one of his cardinal propositions that in prophecy this method of computations must always be regarded. Accordingly, the 2300 days aforesaid are reckoned as so many years, and are declared to commence with the going forth of the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem, and to extend to the resurrection and end of the world in A.D. 1843; and therefore they are supposed to embrace all the other numbers in the Book of Daniel. The subjoined are the five principal calculations: </p>
