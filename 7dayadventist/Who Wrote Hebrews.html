<p class="style1"><span class="style2">Who Wrote The Book of Hebrews?</span><br>
  <span class="style4">By Chris Mack </span>
  <br>
  <br>
An overview of where I am going:<br>
<br>
One doesn&rsquo;t have to read a lot of commentaries on the letter to the Hebrews before one realizes<br>
that the authorship of Hebrews is a problem that has not been solved. Various opinions and postulations are<br>
offered, but scholarship is not willing to decisively offer a definite opinion in regards to the authorship. I am<br>
not going to spend any time here going over the various speculations and the tentative ideas. I am going to<br>
start by saying that, in my opinion, the letter to the Hebrews is the work of the Apostle Paul. It is<br>
possible that Brother Luke penned it as Paul&rsquo;s assistant, but all the internal evidence in the New Testament<br>
leads me to believe that Paul and only Paul could be responsible for its content. This is my major point. I<br>
will follow up with the implications of a Pauline authorship.<br>
<br>
Scholarship has advanced different ideas in terms of who &lsquo;Hebrews&rdquo; was addressed to. Some have<br>
  even advanced the idea that it was written to Gentiles. Others have said that it was written to Jews in the<br>
  Diaspora or to a special sect of the Jews. The evidence of the New Testament leads me to believe that the<br>
  epistle was written to Hebrew Christians living in Jerusalem. The message of Hebrews would also have<br>
  been sent out to Christian Jews living throughout Palestine and would also have value for Jews living in all<br>
  areas of the then known world, but the central focus was on the Christian Jews living in Jerusalem.<br>
  Where and when was the letter written? The letter was written somewhere around 62 A.D. It was<br>
  written from Rome while Paul was imprisoned and under house arrest while waiting for trial before<br>
  Caesar.<br>
  <br>
  Why was the letter written? It was written to address a particular problem that the Jewish<br>
  Christians were having. They were in grave danger of going back to Judaism. They also had a serious<br>
  misunderstanding in regards to the gospel. They had a &lsquo;works&rsquo; righteousness mentality. They had a Jesus<br>
  plus Judaism mentality. They had a salvation by grace plus works theology. They did not understand how<br>
  radical the departure from the religion of Judaism that was expected of them by God. It was written so<br>
  that the leadership of the Jewish Christian church in Jerusalem and the Jewish Christians would<br>
  finally &lsquo;get it&rsquo; in terms of understanding the implication of who Jesus was and what he had<br>
  accomplished by His ministry, His role as a Prophet, His role as a priest, even as the High Priest, in<br>
  His role as King, and Covenant Mediator. The Jewish Christians needed to have a clear presentation of<br>
  the Deity of Jesus Christ and it had to come from their own bible, the Old Testament. The Jewish Christians<br>
  needed to understand the purpose and implications of the Christ&rsquo;s salvific actions which include His<br>
  substitutionary life, His substitutionary death by crucifixion, followed by resurrection and ascension to be<br>
  seated as King on the Throne of God in the heavenly Sanctuary.<br>
  <br>
  Why doesn&rsquo;t the letter have a clear introduction in which the name of the author was clearly<br>
  stated? The absence of the author&rsquo;s name at the beginning of what I am suggesting is a Pauline epistle is<br>
  troubling, especially when each of the New Testament Epistles written by Paul has his name in the very<br>
  first sentence of each of them. There is also major agreement in terms of the authorship of the entire New<br>
  Testament canon with the notable exception of the Epistle to the Hebrews.<br>
  <br>
  There are some valid reasons why Paul did not put his name to this particular epistle. The first is<br>
  that Paul was regarded by himself and by the primitive Christian church as the Apostle to the Gentiles. It<br>
  was Peter who was the Apostle to the Jews. It was James, the brother of Jesus who was the leader of the<br>
  church in Jerusalem. The Jewish Christians in Jerusalem continued to hold their Jewish lineage, their<br>
  temple, their customs, and their Jewish way of life in high esteem. Many of the Jews were able to trace<br>
  their own lineage back to Abraham. The Jews, unlike the Gentiles, knew who they were and where they<br>
  had come from. They had a tradition and a history and a set of &lsquo;boundary markers&rsquo; that had been given to<br>
  them by the covenant God of Israel that distinguished them from all the other nations of the world. They<br>
were special and distinct and even &lsquo;preferred&rsquo; in their own minds. They were caught up in a Jewish<br>
  exceptionalism, akin to the American exceptionalism that we see today in the United States. It would seem<br>
  that the Jewish Christians saw Jerusalem as that &lsquo;shining city on a hill&rsquo;. The Jewish Christians tolerated the<br>
  Gentile Christians, but continued to maintain a wall between themselves and the Gentiles. The Jewish<br>
  Christians even sent envoys to the Gentile Christians in order to convince the Gentiles to come under the<br>
&lsquo;law&rsquo;.<br>
<br>
The evidence leads me to believe that the Jewish Christians were &lsquo;zealous for the law&rdquo; and that<br>
they particularly had a strong dislike and distrust of Paul. He had been reported to have been actively<br>
working to tear down their customs and boundary markers. The Jewish Christians who were zealous for the<br>
&lsquo;law&rsquo; and the customs and the temple had good reason to be concerned about Paul. Their concerns were<br>
based on fact. Their charges against him were absolutely true. Consequently, any epistle with Paul&rsquo;s name<br>
on it would likely have been greeted with initial contempt. They simply did not trust Paul. The Jewish<br>
Christians had good reason to distrust Paul&rsquo;s theology. He actually had been casting what could have<br>
readily been recognized as aspersions on the temple, on the Jewish customs and on the Jewish law. The<br>
people who were in the greatest need of reading and understanding the information and exhortations<br>
found in the Epistle to the Hebrews  were the ones who were the least likely to readit, accept it as a <br>
message from God for them, and to heed it. Therefore, Paul had to write it as it were,incognito. He had <br>
to deliberately hide his authorship I order to get the message across to the people that he loved.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Textual Evidence For My View:</strong><br>
<br>
The Bible is a book that was written by men. It was written into particular cultures. Being as<br>
distant from theses cultures as we are in the 21 st century, it is often difficult to get a clear handle on the<br>
meaning of texts written thousands of years ago. What we do have is knowledge of human nature. In terms<br>
of the way humans think and operate, there is truly nothing new under the sun.<br>
<br>
Saul was an &ldquo;Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin&rdquo;. Rom.11:1 He was<br>
named after the first king of Israel. He changed his name to Paul, which means &lsquo;little&rsquo;, possibly in light of<br>
the fact that he considered himself the &ldquo;least of the Apostles&rdquo; (1 Cor.15:9) and &ldquo;the very least of all saints&rdquo;.<br>
(Eph.3:8) He was described in the apocryphal Acts of Paul and Thecla as a man of little stature, thin haired,<br>
with crooked legs. King Saul was tall and had the look and appearance of nobility. The Apostle who<br>
became known as Paul did not. Unlike &lsquo;Saul&rsquo;, &lsquo;Paul&rsquo; was a Roman name. Paul was born a Roman citizen.<br>
He used that privilege to his advantage. Acts 22:23-29. The name &lsquo;Paul&rsquo; would not have aroused animosity<br>
when Paul was working to evangelize the Gentiles. In the Bible, a change of name is indicative of a change<br>
of character. Saul who was a Christ hater became Paul, a Christ bearer. Acts 13:9 records the first time that the<br>
name Paul was used instead of Saul. Paul never ever forgot how he had severely persecuted the church of<br>
Christ. &ldquo;Paul&rdquo; gained a whole new view of himself. He became a different man, a humble man, a kind man,<br>
a man who grew in love for Christ and his fellowman. In 1 Cor.4:1-15, Paul described how he had<br>
decreased, even became &lsquo;poor&rsquo;, a &lsquo;fool&rsquo;, &lsquo;roughly treated&rsquo;, &lsquo;reviled&rsquo;, &lsquo;persecuted&rsquo;, even as the &lsquo;scum of the<br>
earth&rsquo;, &lsquo;for Christ&rsquo;s sake&rsquo;. He then went on in 1 Cor 4:16 to say; &ldquo;I exhort you therefore, be imitators of<br>
me.&quot; What Paul wanted was for others to imitate him in the way that he imitated Christ. Paul was humble<br>
and bold at the same time. He wanted to do nothing or to say anything that hindered the gospel of Christ. 1<br>
Cor.9:12. Paul said in 1 Cor.9:23,23; &ldquo;I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save<br>
some, and I do all things for the sake of the gospel.&rdquo; Here we have the character and mind set of a man who<br>
was willing to suppress his authority and humble himself to the uttermost in order that the gospel of Christ<br>
be made known. This is the man that God would have write the Epistle to the Hebrews.<br>
<br>
Paul certainly had the theological training that would have prepared him for putting together the<br>
theology found in the book of Hebrews. Paul was fluent in Hebrew and Greek. He was &ldquo;educated under<br>
Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers&rdquo;. Acts. 22:3. Paul was &ldquo;a Pharisee, a son of<br>
Pharisees&rdquo;. Acts 23:6 The &lsquo;Pharisees&rsquo; were known as the &lsquo;separated ones&rsquo;. &ldquo;Basic to the Pharisaic<br>
conception of religion was the belief that the Babylonian Exile was caused by Israel&rsquo;s failure to keep the<br>
Torah (the Mosaic Law) and that it&rsquo;s keeping was an individual as well as national duty&rdquo;. See Tyndale<br>
Bible Dictionary. The Pharisees believed in a messiah to come and in the resurrection of the dead. Acts<br>
23:6. As religious examples to the common people, their hope was that a separated holy Israel that was<br>
  fully dedicated to the Torah would usher in the Kingdom of God on earth, and that the dominion of the<br>
  Gentiles over Israel would be broken. Paul said of himself, &ldquo;I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of<br>
  my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.&rdquo; Gal.1:14. As a Pharisee, Saul<br>
  would have recited the Shema every morning and every evening. He would have been fanatical in regards<br>
  to his scrupulous observance of all of the Jewish laws and customs. If anyone had the right to believe that<br>
  they had any reason to have confidence in their lineage and in their observance of the Torah as a way to<br>
  find favor with God, it was Saul. Saul described himself in this manner; &ldquo;as to the righteousness which is<br>
  in the Law, found blameless&rdquo;. Phil. 3:6. The converted Paul would subsequently cast aspersions on his own<br>
  previous way of Law righteousness by saying; &ldquo;not having a righteousness of my own derived from the<br>
  Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of<br>
  faith&rdquo;. Phil. 3:9. See Phil. 3:1-11. And this &ldquo;law&rdquo; would have included all the rituals of Judaism.<br>
  <br>
  Saul, albeit misguided, believed that he was doing God&rsquo;s will when he persecuted the Christians.<br>
  He saw them as idolaters by their worship of another god, i.e. Jesus. He saw this false messiah gaining<br>
  credence with the Jews and he sought to snuff out the sect for the glory of God. Their mere existence put<br>
  Israel&rsquo;s kingdom hope in danger. Even as he held the cloaks of those who stoned Stephen, he did it with a<br>
  clear conscience. &ldquo;Even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. And<br>
  yet I was shown mercy, because I acted ignorantly in unbelief&rdquo;. 1 Tim. 1:13.<br>
  <br>
  The converted Paul had an intimate knowledge of the facts, the education, the experience, the<br>
  mind set, the world view and the hopes and aspirations of Israel. Paul, as we see was educated and zealous.<br>
  Many scholars have argued against Pauline authorship of Hebrews, but none have argued, to my knowledge,<br>
  that Paul was unfit or unable or lacked the knowledge of Judaism to write it.<br>
  <br>
  As we all know from personal experience, we of the human race are a mixed bag of intellect and<br>
  emotions. In the case of Saul, it was not his study or giant intellect that brought on his conversion to<br>
  Christianity. It was the theophany / christophany that he experienced on the road to Damascus. Saul was on<br>
  his way to round up Christians for persecution and punishment. It was this revelation, this dramatic<br>
  encounter and experience with the risen Lord Jesus that forever changed Saul&rsquo;s life. Saul fell to the ground<br>
  and when he got up, &ldquo;though his eyes were open, he could see nothing&rdquo;. Acts 9:8 His physical blindness<br>
  was a revelation to him of his spiritual blindness. Saul was led to Damascus. The Lord spoke to his servant<br>
  Ananias and told him exactly where to go so that he could lay his hands on Saul so that Saul could regain<br>
  his sight. Ananias questioned the Lord, being no doubt fearful of Saul. &ldquo;The Lord said to him, Go, for he is<br>
  a chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel&rdquo;. Acts<br>
  9:15. We often think of Paul as the Apostle to the Gentiles. In his initial mandate from Christ, Saul was<br>
  told that bearing His name to Israel was also within his mandate. Saul knew that he had been apprehended<br>
  by the God of Israel and that it was Jesus. After regaining his sight, being filled with the Holy Spirit, he<br>
  arose and was baptized. Saul immediately began to proclaim Jesus as Son of God and that Jesus was the<br>
  Christ. See Acts 9: 1-22.<br>
  <br>
  Paul would use his own experience with the risen Christ as his testimony before the Jews as the<br>
  book of Acts records. See Acts 21 through Acts 26. Saul had not only been personally involved, but was at<br>
  the forefront of the persecution of the Christians. When we link this with his ordination by the Lord Jesus<br>
  as His Apostle, we must believe that this experience cut a very very heavy groove in Saul&rsquo;s mind. It left an<br>
  indelible mark. It was a radical unforgettable transforming experience that shaped his way of thinking for<br>
  the rest of his life. Saul now saw Christianity from both sides of the fence. He was uniquely qualified to<br>
  understand the Jewish mind set and the Jewish Christian mind set. As the apostle sent to the Gentiles, and<br>
  having lived among the Gentiles, he was also very well equipped to identify with Gentiles.<br>
  <br>
  Paul, in the first chapter of Galatians, told the churches of Galatia that he did not receive his<br>
  gospel from men, but received it &ldquo;through a revelation of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; He then went on to say; I did not<br>
  immediately consult with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before<br>
  me, but I went to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus. Then three years later I went up to<br>
  Jerusalem&rdquo;. We may well ask ourselves what Paul was doing in Arabia. If Paul didn&rsquo;t consult with flesh<br>
  and blood, who was he consulting with? Paul, with his extensive knowledge of the Old Testament went into<br>
  the wilderness of Arabia in order to make sense of his Bible, the Old Testament. It even makes sense that he<br>
  went to Sinai, the mountain of God, in order to spend time in solitude with Spirit of Jesus so that Christ<br>
  might explain the gospel to him that he was to preach to the Gentiles and to Israel. In his epistle to the<br>
Galatians, Paul went on to mention &lsquo;Mount Sinai in Arabia&rsquo; and explained how the slavery and bondage to<br>
the law as a way of salvation pertained to the &lsquo;present Jerusalem&rsquo;. Gal.4:21-31; 5:1-7. Clearly Sinai was<br>
on Paul&rsquo;s mind when he wrote Galatians. This makes it all the more interesting that the writer of Hebrews<br>
  records the experience of Israel at Sinai in Heb.12:18-29. The way of God was never achieved by climbing<br>
  the slippery sides of Sinai. The law was never meant to save or give life. It was always through the blood of<br>
  Christ, through the blood of the eternal covenant between the Father and the Son that provided salvation<br>
  and life. In the context of Hebrews 12 , we read of Moses, the blazing fire and the shaking mountain which<br>
  was Sinai compared with Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem. We read of Jesus, the mediator of a new<br>
  covenant&rdquo;. Interesting it is that Paul in Galatians 4 speaks of Jerusalem and two covenants. In Galatians 2,<br>
  Paul had already spoken of the promise / covenant of God with the Seed (singular). Gal.2:16-19. The<br>
  covenant promise of God was the means of salvation. The Christians addressed in the epistle to the<br>
  Hebrews needed to understand this truth in the same way as the Galatians who were being accosted by the<br>
  Judaisers needed to understand it. <br>
  <br>
  Where else in the New Testament do we see such a similarity of words,theme and theology? <br>
  We don&rsquo;t, and this again gives credence to the idea that Paul wrote Hebrews.<br>
  We read in Heb.12:22,23,24; &ldquo;But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God,<br>
  the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the general assembly and church of the first born who<br>
  are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect, and to<br>
  Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant&rdquo;. This graphic description seems to be much more than a<br>
  theological statement rooted out through study or even insight given by the Spirit of God. It sounds much<br>
  more like the testimony of one who had actually been to heaven and seen it all with his own eyes. Only<br>
  John and Paul could claim that privilege. John was to write his gospels and apocalypse later, after the fall of<br>
  Jerusalem. That leaves us with Paul. In 1 Cor.12:1-7, Paul spoke of his visions and revelations of the Lord<br>
  and how he was caught up to the third heaven, that is, was caught up to Paradise and heard inexpressible<br>
  words and was privy to the surpassing greatness of the revelations. Here we have another connection, even<br>
a strong connection between Paul and the writer of Hebrews.</p>
<p class="style1">In Heb.12:21 we read; &ldquo;And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, &ldquo;I am full of fear and<br>
  trembling&rdquo;. We may well assume that the blazing fire, the gloom, darkness, whirlwind, the blast of the<br>
  trumpet which was the voice of God which shook the mountain all contributed to an overwhelming fear on<br>
  the part of Moses for his own life. The problem with this explanation is that Moses had already been under<br>
  the direct guidance and direction of God in Egypt. He had already been up the mountain in the very<br>
  presence of God. Moses had spoken to God &lsquo;face to face&rsquo;. Exodus 19 &amp;amp;. 33:11. It is when we read Deut.<br>
  9:19 which is the second witness to the giving of the law on Sinai that we gain insight into this statement.<br>
&ldquo;For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the LORD was wrathful against you in order<br>
to destroy you&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="style1">What a different way we have of considering the text in Hebrews based on this insight. Now, let&rsquo;s<br>
  backtrack and consider how Paul felt about the Jews. I now quote Rom. 9:1-4; &ldquo;I am telling the truth in<br>
  Christ, I am not lying, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit, that I have great sorrow and<br>
  unceasing grief in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the<br>
  sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites&rdquo;. This is reminiscent of Moses<br>
  who said; &ldquo;But now, if Thou wilt, forgive their sin &ndash;and if not, please blot me out of Thy book which thou<br>
  hast written&rdquo;. Exod.32:32. Exodus 32 explicitly deals with the golden calf incident, the idolatry, and the<br>
  breaking of the covenant by Israel at the base of Sinai. Both Moses and Paul had a great fear that Israel had<br>
  irrevocably broken the covenant. It makes a lot of sense that Paul, who had a deep love for his fellow<br>
  Israelites who were Christians, feared that their rejection of the person and work of Christ revealed in their<br>
  insistence on temple worship, their reliance on the present high priest and their strong adherence to the<br>
  ceremonial law and the customs of the Jews would cut them off from Christ. If Paul had &lsquo;great sorrow&rsquo; and<br>
&lsquo;unceasing grief&rsquo; for his fellow Israelites, image how deeply he felt for the Jewish Christians who were in<br>
danger of repudiating Christ and going back into slavery to a system of dead works! The epistle to the<br>
Hebrews is much more than a theological treatise. It is a pastoral epistle. It is full of warnings and<br>
admonitions utilizing the strongest possible language in an effort to restrain a real danger of apostasy. It<br>
was written by someone who had been in their shoes as a Jew and by someone who really cared as a<br>
Christian. Paul fits the bill on all accounts.<br>
<br>
  Many scholars have seen the connection between the Jesus of Heb.12:24 and the voice that shook<br>
  the earth at Sinai. It was the pre-incarnate Christ that gave God&rsquo;s holy covenant law on Sinai. The voice of<br>
Jesus will again shake the earth and the heaven. In Heb.11:24-26 we read of Moses &ldquo;considering the<br>
reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt&rdquo;. Hebrews chapter 1 is one of the most<br>
powerful passages in the New Testament that declares the divinity of Christ. In Heb.1:3; &ldquo;He (Christ) is the<br>
radiance of His (God&rsquo;s) glory and the exact representation of His nature.&rdquo; In the same verse we read of<br>
how Christ &ldquo;upholds all things by the word of His power&rdquo;. In verse 6 &ldquo;all the angels of God are called to<br>
worship Him&rdquo;. In v.9, God the Son is addressed as God by God the Father. In v.10 we read, &ldquo;Thou Lord, in<br>
the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Thy hands.&rdquo; Psalm 45,<br>
the Psalm that speaks of God as King, is quoted in Heb.1:8 &amp;amp; 9. &ldquo;But of the Son He says, Thy throne O<br>
God is forever and ever.&rdquo; What we have in Hebrews is a very high Christology. Prior to the writing of<br>
  Hebrews, we do not find a higher Christology anywhere in the New Testament with the exception of the<br>
  writings of Paul. The gospel of John with its very high christology was written somewhere between 80 and<br>
  90 A.D. Most scholars would see Revelation written somewhere between 94 and 96 A.D. Some scholars<br>
  see a gradual move towards Christ&rsquo;s divinity when John&rsquo;s gospel was made known. I would strongly<br>
  disagree and argue for a very high Christology from the beginning of the church. It was the earliest writings<br>
  of the New Testament prophets that provided these insights, and it was Paul who wrote them. See<br>
Eph.2:20,21; Phil.2:5-11; Col.1:15-20; 2:9.<br>
<br>
  We do not want to forget 1 Cor.8:1-6 in which Paul declared Jesus to be the LORD of the Shema.<br>
  V.4; &ldquo;there is no God but One&rdquo;. V6; &ldquo;Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things,<br>
  and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we exist through<br>
  Him.&rdquo; Saul held the robes of the ones who stoned Stephen as he believed Stephen to be a blasphemer and<br>
  an idolater. Stephen died with the words; &ldquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!&rdquo; Acts 7:59. Saul, the Pharisee<br>
  recited the Shema twice a day in his worship of the One God. It was a major breakthrough for Paul when he<br>
  came to understand that Jesus Christ was the LORD of the Shema, and worthy of the same worship as the<br>
  Father. See Deut. 6:1-15. It is especially in verses 4&amp;amp;5 that we read what Saul recited daily. It is notable<br>
  that we read the same words that Paul wrote in 1 Cor 8 utilized in Heb.2:10. Speaking of Jesus who was<br>
  mentioned in the previous verse (v.9), we read &ldquo;For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and<br>
  through whom are all things&rdquo;. The &lsquo;Him&rsquo; in the context, would clearly seem to be the Father. The &ldquo;though<br>
  whom are all things&rdquo; of 1 Cor.8:6 is clearly speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ. V11; &ldquo;For both He who<br>
  sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one / One&rdquo;. The next word &lsquo;Father&rsquo; is supplied. It is not<br>
  in the text. The Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are both fully God and are both part of the One God<br>
&ldquo;through whom are all things&rdquo;. The point here is that the writer to the Hebrews has included the language<br>
of the Shema. No one but Paul made it as clear. No one but Paul spelled it out as early. The fact that both<br>
passages are quoting the Shema is another indication that it was Paul who wrote Hebrews.<br>
<br>
In 1 Cor.10:1-11; we read of how the &lsquo;Rock&rsquo; that followed  Moses and &lsquo;our fathers&rsquo; in the<br>
wilderness was none other than Christ. V.4 &ldquo;Nevertheless, with most of them God was not well-pleased; for<br>
they were laid low in the wilderness&rdquo;. V.5 See Jude 4 &amp;amp; 5 which corroborates the fact that it was the pre-<br>
incarnate Lord (some manuscripts say &lsquo;Jesus&rsquo;) who after saving a people out of the land of Egypt,<br>
subsequently destroyed those who did not believe.&rdquo; It is clear from v.4 that the Lord being spoken of here is<br>
the Lord Jesus Christ. What is of interest for our purpose is that the writer of Hebrews was concerned about<br>
Israel&rsquo;s prior history of unbelief and disobedience in the wilderness. Heb.3:8-11,15; 4:3,5,7. Paul used the<br>
history of immoral idolatrous Israel in the wilderness of Arabia as an example and warning to the church at<br>
Corinth. Where else in the New Testament do we find a prophet utilizing the wilderness experience as a<br>
warning against unbelief and disobedience? We only find it in Hebrews. This leads me to believe that both<br>
1 Corinthians and Hebrews were written by the same person, Paul.<br>
<br>
We know that it is Ps. 95 that the writer of Hebrews quoted in Heb 3 &amp;amp; 4. It is of interest that the<br>
psalmist wrote in v.10; &ldquo;For forty years I loathed that generation&rdquo;. The Lord Jesus in the Olivet Discourse<br>
of Matt.24 warned His disciples; &ldquo;Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these<br>
things take place.&rdquo; V.34. A generation is generally regarded as forty years. It also is used in the context of<br>
an &ldquo;unbelieving and perverted generation&rdquo;. See Luke 9:41 and many other places. The word &lsquo;generation&rsquo;<br>
therefore can speak of a time period of 40 years or a particular type of people, often with an evil<br>
unbelieving mind set. The word can also include both characteristics speaking of the same people at the<br>
same time. The point here for our purpose is to note that the writer of Hebrews was laying out and<br>
repeating a warning that had been given in the past history of Israel. The warning given to ancient Israel<br>
was just as valid for the Hebrew Christians. There would have been no need to warn believing Jewish<br>
Christians to let go of their prize which was the temple and all the associated customs if the temple was no<br>
longer standing. A warning is only valid before the crisis. It was imperative that the Jewish Christians let<br>
  go of their national zeal and Jewish rituals before the judgment of God<font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&#8212;</strong></font>the consuming fire<font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&#8212;</strong></font>tore down the<br>
  city of Jerusalem and burned that desolate temple with fire. Paul, as we have already seen, has used the<br>
&lsquo;wilderness&rsquo; and the forty years that the Israelites spent in that wilderness as a warning to the Gentile<br>
  Christian church. It makes all the sense in the world that Paul would use the same situation as a warning to<br>
  the Jewish Christian church.<br>

  Central to Paul&rsquo;s message was the gospel. The gospel was at the very heart of what he preached in<br>
  his ministry to the Gentiles. It was also essential that the Jewish Christians hear and understand the gospel.<br>
  The Jewish Christians knew that Jesus was the Messiah, the Christ, and they believed that he died and rose<br>
  again. The problem with the &lsquo;cross&rsquo; is that it needed explanation. The implications of the &lsquo;cross&rsquo; of Christ<br>
  were not fully understood by them. The problem was that the Apostle Paul, the man who most clearly<br>
  understood the meaning and implications of the cross, was held in suspicion and disregard by a large<br>
  number of the Jewish Christians. Here are some of Paul&rsquo;s statements in regards to the gospel, its centrality,<br>
  its definition, and its basis, its achievements and its implications. &ldquo;Now I make known to you, brethren, the<br>
  gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, by which you are saved,<br>
  if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain, For I delivered too you as of<br>
  first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures and that He<br>
  was buried, and that He was raised on the third day, according to the Scripture.&rdquo; 1 Cor.15:1-4. &ldquo;In Him<br>
  (Christ) we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches<br>
  of His grace&rdquo;; Eph 1:7 &ldquo;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is<br>
  the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast&rdquo;. Eph.2:8 &amp;amp; 9. &ldquo;For I am not ashamed<br>
  of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to<br>
  the Greek. Rom.1:17 &ldquo;But now apart from the Law, the righteousness of God has been manifested, being<br>
  witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness of God for all who believe; for there is no<br>
  distinction; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified as a gift by His grace<br>
  through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God publicly displayed as a propitiation in His<br>
  blood through faith.&rdquo;. Rom.3:21-25. &ldquo;Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God<br>
  through our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;. Rom.5:1 We might well ask ourselves where the Christian church would<br>
  be today without the Pauline epistles and without the clear message of the gospel that he presented. We<br>
  should also ask the same question in regards to the epistle to the Hebrews.<br>
  <br>
  In the letter to the Hebrews, the writer makes mention in Heb.2:17 how Jesus made &lsquo;propitiation&rsquo;<br>
  for our sins. &lsquo;Propitiation&rsquo; is a word that comes to us from the temple. Propitiation involves blood, death<br>
  and sacrifice. The word &lsquo;propitiation&rsquo; means to turn away the wrath of God. The wrath of God is only<br>
  turned away when justice is served and the evil doer is punished. A clear example in the Old Testament of<br>
  how God&rsquo;s wrath is turned away, propitiated and atoned for when the evil doer is punished is the story of<br>
  Phinehas. See Numbers 25; Ps.106:28-31. Deut.32:39-43. In Hebrews, Jesus is Himself the High Priest<br>
  who made the propitiatory sacrifice and is Himself the sacrifice that was offered. Paul stated it this way in 2<br>
  Cor.5:21 &ldquo;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, that we might become the righteousness<br>
  of God in Him&rdquo;. In Rom.5:9; Paul said &ldquo;Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall<br>
  be saved from the wrath of God through Him.&rdquo; On the great Day of Atonement, the high priest went in to<br>
  the Most Holy Place and made atonement, that is, propitiation for the sins of the people. A major theme of<br>
  Hebrews is that Christ is our High Priest. Hebrews is the only book in the New Testament that speaks of<br>
  Christ as High Priest. The term &lsquo;high priest&rsquo; is used 15 times in Hebrews. The term &ldquo;High Priest&rdquo; is directly<br>
  used 10 times for Jesus in Hebrews. The remaining times speak of the work of the high priest. What we<br>
  have in the epistle to the Hebrews is reference to the book of Numbers. Numbers is the account of the<br>
  children of Israel in the &lsquo;wilderness&rsquo;. A generation of Israelites would spend forty years in that wilderness<br>
  and die there. They would not enter the Promised Land. In Hebrews, we read of how the Israelites hardened<br>
  their hearts, how they provoked the LORD, They did not know His ways. God was angry with them. They<br>
  were disbelieving and disobedient. They had the good news, that is, the gospel preached to them, but they<br>
  failed to believe it. Heb.4:1-6. They had the tabernacle in their midst. God dwelt among them in the Most<br>
  Holy Place of that tabernacle. The priests daily offered sacrifices. Once a year their high priest went into<br>
  the most holy place and made atonement for them. They had the &lsquo;gospel preached to them&rsquo;, but they<br>
  continued in rebellion and unbelief. Consequently, they failed to enter into the &lsquo;promised rest&rsquo;. They failed<br>
to trust the LORD. The crux of the matter was that they relied on their own works, on their own strength,<br>
  on their own understanding. The pastoral message of the letter to the Hebrew Christians is that they<br>
  were in great danger of following the pattern set by their forefathers. Strong warnings are not given in<br>
  a vacuum. The reason that they were warned was because there was a clear and present danger that the<br>
  Hebrew Christians would revert to a works based theology, thereby making light of the mercy, grace and<br>
  salvific actions of God&rsquo;s Christ. &ldquo;For the one who has entered His rest has himself rested from his works,<br>
  as God did from His.&rdquo; Heb.4:10. Peace with God, where there in no longer enmity between God and man,<br>
  should produce peace and rest in the human heart. The Hebrew Christians needed to be diligent to enter that<br>
  rest.<br>
  <br>
  The Hebrew Christians were in danger of drifting away from what they had heard. &ldquo;How shall we<br>
  escape if we neglect so great a salvation&rdquo;. Heb.2:1 &amp;amp; 3. The warnings were strong and repeated. &ldquo;For in<br>
  the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made<br>
  partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and<br>
  then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify to themselves<br>
  the Son of God, and put Him to open shame&rdquo;. Heb.6:4-6 &ldquo;For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving<br>
  the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain terrifying expectation<br>
  of judgment, and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries. Anyone who has set aside the Law<br>
  of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much severer punishment do<br>
  you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the<br>
  blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?&rdquo; Heb.10:26-29<br>
  These words were written to believers. They were written to Jewish Christians. The entire book of Hebrews<br>
  makes no sense unless we come to grips with the fact that it was not only Christians, but Jewish Christians<br>
  who were being addressed here. These strong and unequivocal warnings were given to a people who were<br>
  in imminent danger of going back to Judaism, to the temple, to the blood sacrifices and to the rituals that<br>
  had all found fulfillment in Christ. They were in danger of repeating the same attitude of rebellion,<br>
  disobedience and unbelief manifested by their forefathers who died in the wilderness and never entered the<br>
  rest of God. The willful sin in the context would have been none other than rejecting the person and work<br>
  of Christ whom they had previously expressed faith in.<br>
  <br>
  The letter to the Hebrews could have only been written by a man who understood the Jewish<br>
  mind set, the Jewish culture, and the history of Israel. It could have only been written by a man who was a<br>
  master theologian with a thorough understanding of the Old Testament Scriptures. It could have only been<br>
  written by a man who had a deep love for his people Israel and had a deep love for Christ. It could only<br>
  have been written by a man who had zealously believed that he was absolutely right about something, but<br>
  later to have found out, &lsquo;by a revelation of Jesus Christ&rsquo;, how absolutely wrong he had been. Hebrews<br>
  could only have been written by a man who perceived a &lsquo;new theology&rsquo; in terms of Jesus as High Priest<br>
  because he had personally witnessed Christ at work in heaven. It could only have been written by Paul.<br>
  When Paul was preaching in Asia Minor to the Gentiles, he had a continual problem with Jewish<br>
  Christians from Jerusalem who had come to try to bring the Gentile Christian converts under the Jewish<br>
  law. &ldquo;But it was because of the false brethren who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in<br>
  Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage.&rdquo; Gal.2:5. &ldquo;But from those who were of high reputation&rdquo;;<br>
&ldquo;for prior to the coming of certain men from James, he (Cephas / Peter) used to eat with the Gentiles, but<br>
when &lsquo;they&rsquo; (the Jews of supposedly high reputation from Jerusalem) came, he (Peter) began to withdraw<br>
  and hold himself aloof, fearing the party/converts from the circumcision, and the rest of the Jews joined him<br>
  in hypocrisy&rdquo;. &ldquo;But when I (Paul) saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel &hellip;&rdquo;.<br>
  Gal.2:6, 12,13.14. In v.16 Paul went on to repeat the same statement three times in the same verse, &ldquo;a man<br>
  is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus&rdquo;. &ldquo;I do not nullify the grace of<br>
  God; for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly.&rdquo; Gal.2:21. &ldquo;Do not be<br>
  subject again to a yoke of slavery.&rdquo; &ldquo;You have been severed from Christ, you who seeking to be justified by<br>
  law, you have fallen from grace.&rdquo; Gal.5:1 &amp;amp; 4. God&rsquo;s holy covenant law as revealed in the 10<br>
  commandments is as eternal as God is. They define His character and are the principles that underlie the<br>
  Kingdom of God. The ceremonial law was given to Israel as way for man in sin to deal with the sins<br>
  against the covenant. Neither the ceremonial law nor the 10 commandments could justify or give life. The 10<br>
  commandments are not the &lsquo;yoke of bondage&rsquo;. The misuse of the Law is the &lsquo;yoke of bondage&rsquo;. Seeking a<br>
  right standing before God on the basis of one&rsquo;s commandment keeping, &lsquo;seeking to be justified by law&rsquo; is<br>
the &lsquo;yoke of bondage&rsquo;. For the Jewish Christians, the value that they placed on the ceremonial law and their<br>
Jewish customs and temple ceremonies was also in danger of being a &lsquo;yoke of bondage&rsquo;. The Judaizers had<br>
  sought to bind these requirements on the Gentiles. Paul knew that the ceremonial laws had found<br>
  fulfillment in Christ and that to revert to them was like throwing dung at the cross. He would have none of<br>
  it as revealed in his epistles and in the letter to the Hebrews.<br>
  <br>
  In 2 Corinthians chapter 11, Paul warned the Gentile Christians at Corinth about men who were<br>
&ldquo;false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.&rdquo; 2 Cor.11:13. Who were<br>
these men? Paul said; &ldquo;Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of<br>
Abraham? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as if insane) I more so&rdquo;. 2 Cor.11:22 &amp;amp; 23. Paul<br>
said of himself; &ldquo;For I consider myself not in the least inferior to the most eminent apostles&rdquo; (super-<br>
apostles) &ldquo;for if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or you receive a<br>
  different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear<br>
  this beautifully.&rdquo; 2 Cor.11:5 &amp;amp; 4. The same problem that Paul dealt with in Galatia and in Corinth was a<br>
  snare to the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem. It was the Jewish Christian converts that were peddling this<br>
  false gospel. No one would have been better equipped to deal with this problem than the apostle Paul. The<br>
  problem, however, was that the battles that Paul had with these Jewish Christians made them the least<br>
  likely to listen to or read an epistle directed to them by Paul.<br>
  <br>
  Paul was a passionate man, a zealous man, a driven man. He had a revolutionary experience with<br>
  Christ on the road to Damascus. He had the privilege of being taken up to the third heaven, to the Paradise<br>
  of God. These experiences cut some very deep grooves into his psyche. Paul had another teachable<br>
  experience as revealed in Acts chapter 21. In Acts 15:1; &ldquo;Some men came down from Judea and began<br>
  teaching the brethren, &lsquo;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be<br>
  saved&rsquo;&rdquo;. Paul determined that he would have to go to Jerusalem to straighten the matter out. When they got<br>
  there, they met with the apostles and the elders. Among this group were &ldquo;certain ones of the sect of the<br>
  Pharisees who had believed&rdquo;. They &ldquo;stood up, saying, &lsquo;It is necessary to circumcise them (the Gentiles)<br>
  and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses.&rdquo; Acts 15:5. As we know, Paul got things worked out with<br>
  Peter and James and he was sent on his way to return to his work with the Gentiles and the &ldquo;yoke which<br>
  neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear&rdquo; was not to be placed on the Gentiles. Acts 15:10<br>
  Years later, Paul again went to Jerusalem, as recorded in Acts 21. He was determined to go, in<br>
  spite of the fact that he was continually warned not to. We read about his meeting with James and the elders<br>
  in Acts 21:18-21. &ldquo;and now the following day Paul went in with us to James and all the elders were<br>
  present. And after he had greeted them, he began to relate one by one the things which God had done<br>
  among the Gentiles through his ministry. And when they had heard it they began glorifying God; and they<br>
  said to him (Paul), &lsquo;You see, brother, how many thousands (literally &lsquo;ten thousands&rsquo;) there are among the<br>
  Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law; and they have been told about you<br>
  that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles not to circumcise their children nor walk<br>
according to the customs.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="style1">We know what followed. Paul was pressured into giving a demonstration to the<br>
  Jewish Christians that he also was zealous for the Law and customs. Paul was pressured into taking a vow,<br>
  shaving his head going into the temple, observing 7 days of purification and then going into the temple<br>
  again after 7 days &ldquo;until the sacrifice was offered&rdquo; for the other four men who were taking the vow with<br>
  him. We know that Jews from Asia saw Paul in the temple stirred up the multitude accusing Paul of<br>
  preaching against &ldquo;the Law, and this place (the temple); and besides has even brought Greeks into the<br>
  temple and has defied this holy place&rdquo;. Acts 21:28. What we are seeing here is there is not a whole lot of<br>
  difference between the Jews and the Jewish Christians. For Paul to have even knuckled under to the point<br>
  of going into a temple and giving credence to a system that had been rendered obsolete and having been<br>
  even willing to have a sacrifice offered on his behalf in the temple was a serious mistake on Paul&rsquo;s part. I<br>
  would submit that this was another turning point in Paul&rsquo;s experience. He knew then that someone had to<br>
  deal with the problem of the Law of Moses, the customs, and the temple as it was being understood by the<br>
  Jewish Christians. The leaders in Jerusalem simply had not &lsquo;got it&rsquo;. When Jesus said, &ldquo;Your house is left to<br>
  you desolate&rdquo;; he meant it. Matt.23:38 The moment that the Father&rsquo;s hands ripped the veil separating the<br>
  most holy place from view, which was the same moment that Christ died; the temple and the ceremonial<br>
  law with all of its sacrifices was rendered obsolete. Matt.27:50,51; Heb.8:13 Paul&rsquo;s dramatic experience in<br>
  Jerusalem was the catalyst that crystallized this truth in his mind. The Jewish Christians needed someone to<br>
  explain to them from the Scriptures that they had gone off the rails. Only Paul could do it.<br>
  <br>
  The rest of the book of acts records Paul and his various defenses of his gospel and finally his <br>
  arrival in Rome where he was placed under house arrest. It is of interest that Brother Luke, who was the<br>
  author of Acts continually included himself in the record through the words &lsquo;us&rsquo; and &lsquo;we&rsquo;. See for example<br>
  Acts 28:1,2,7,10, 11,12,13,14,15,16. Luke was doubtless on the same trip to Rome with Paul and was an<br>
  eyewitness to all of Paul&rsquo;s activities. This leaves me with the conclusion that Paul, upon arriving in Rome<br>
  in approximately 60 A.D. went to work on writing an epistle to the Hebrew Christians who had already<br>
  clearly displayed that they simply had not &lsquo;got it&rsquo; in terms of the finished work of Christ and in regards to<br>
  His ongoing work as High Priest in the heavenly Sanctuary. The thoughts in Hebrews were definitely<br>
  Paul&rsquo;s. It would make sense that the Paul was assisted in the writing of it by Brother Luke. Interesting it is<br>
  that the writer of Hebrews said, &ldquo;those from Italy greet you&rdquo;. Rome, of course, is in Italy. It is also of<br>
  interest that the writer of Hebrews mentioned his beloved Timothy. Heb.13:23,24.<br>
  <br>
  Of all the New Testament writers, it is Paul and only Paul that explained the &lsquo;righteousness of<br>
  God, even the righteousness that comes on the basis of faith&rdquo;. Rom.3:21,22. His epistle to the Romans is a<br>
  treatise on the &lsquo;righteousness of God&rsquo;. Interesting it is that the writer of Hebrews used the words &lsquo;righteous&rsquo;<br>
  and &lsquo;righteousness&rsquo;, even the &lsquo;righteousness which is by faith&rsquo; 3 times and he used the word &lsquo;faith&rsquo; 23<br>
  times! It was also Paul that used the word and concept of &lsquo;propitiation&rsquo; in Romans as it was used in<br>
  Hebrews. It is also of interest that it was the apostle Paul alone who dealt with the question and problem of<br>
  Israel as it related to righteousness and faith. Romans chapter 9 through 11 deal with this same subject. It<br>
  again leads credence to the fact that it was Paul who wrote Hebrews.<br>
  <br>
  Hebrews chapter 12 speaks of how the Lord disciplines his people as sons, and that if they do not<br>
  regard the discipline of the Lord, they are illegitimate. Without question, the Hebrew Christians were in<br>
  need of discipline. Heb.12:4-11. They were essentially taken to the woodshed for not progressing in their<br>
  Christian walk. &ldquo;For by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you<br>
  the elementary principles of the oracles of God&rdquo;. Heb.5:12. See Heb.5:11 through Heb.6:3 and Heb 6:7-9.<br>
  The Hebrew Christians had need of understanding the basics. Their service to Christ and His mission of<br>
  preaching the gospel to the whole world wasn&rsquo;t making any headway as they remained focused on their<br>
  Jewish customs. Meanwhile Paul and his comrades were turning the world upside down with the teaching<br>
  of Christ. The Jewish Christians needed to understand once and for all that they should not go back to the<br>
  temple in Jerusalem, observe the sacrifices, or give any credence to the work of the high priest that<br>
  ministered in that obsolete temple. They now were in possession of something better. They now had a<br>
  perfect once-and-for-all-time Day of Atonement Sacrifice made on Calvary&rsquo;s cross by Christ Jesus their<br>
  High Priest who now ministered as their High Priest and King in the heavenly Temple. Christ Jesus was far<br>
  superior in every way than Moses, Aaron, and the Levitical priesthood.<br>
  <br>
  The book of Hebrew deals with &lsquo;perfection&rsquo;. This word can mean maturity or reaching a goal or<br>
  bringing to completion. The very fact that there was a daily sacrifice for sins in the temple and that the high<br>
  priest would go in year after year on the Day of Atonement speaks to the fact that the Jewish system never<br>
  did get the job done. It never did make anything perfect. Heb.7:11,18,19; 10:1-4, 11. Conversely, the work<br>
  of Christ achieved this goal. &ldquo;but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right<br>
  hand of God, for by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified (being sanctified).<br>
  Heb.10:12,14.<br>
  <br>
  The Everlasting Covenant is between the Father and the Son. It is one and the same as the New<br>
  Covenant. The &lsquo;old covenant&rsquo; is a &lsquo;works based&rsquo; religion that has been with us from the beginning and<br>
  continues to this day. The ceremonies of the temple were never intended to be a basis for salvation by<br>
&lsquo;works&rsquo;. They were just the opposite in that they were a God mandated way for man in sin to approach a<br>
Holy God. But the Jews turned the entire system on its head. Rom.9:30-33; 10:1-11. The entire book of<br>
Hebrews is an explanation of Psm. 110. The Covenant Partners are revealed in Hebrews chapter 1. The<br>
divinity of the Son is central to Hebrews 1. The humanity of the Son is central to Hebrews chapter 2. What<br>
we have in Heb.2 is not Israel but humanity depicted. The Jewish Christians were so self centered and self<br>
absorbed that they had lost sight of their role and mandate. The gospel was for the world, for all of<br>
humanity. The newness of the New Covenant mentioned in Heb.8 &amp;amp;10 is the revelation of the LORD God&rsquo;s<br>
way of salvation by grace that takes us all the way back to Adam in the original Edenic covenant. The way<br>
of salvation by grace through faith in the promise of God and the God of Promise is further explained and<br>
amplified in all the ensuing covenants. The believing Israelites mentioned in Heb. 11 are recorded as an<br>
unbroken stream of men and women of faith from Abel on down through time who had right standing<br>
before God based on that faith. They looked forward in faith to the Redeemer to come. They were used as a<br>
basis to &ldquo;lay aside every encumbrance, and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with<br>
endurance the race that is set before us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith&rdquo;. <br>
<br>
Once again it was only Paul who had used the illustration of running a race and winning. 1 Cor.9:24-27.<br>
  In the last chapter of Hebrews, the Jewish Christians were directed to lay aside their temple, their<br>
  city, their customs and their adherence to a works based religion. &ldquo;For the bodies of those animals whose<br>
  blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.<br>
  Therefore, Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the camp,<br>
  bearing His reproach. For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.<br>
  Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of<br>
  the eternal (everlasting) covenant, even Jesus our Lord, equip you in every good thing to do His will&rdquo;.<br>
  Heb&rsquo;13:11-14, 20,21.<br>
  <br>
  To let go of Judaism meant going outside the camp, letting go of the temple and all that it entailed,<br>
  and even leaving the hopes that they had for the earthly Jerusalem. It exhorted them to suffer reproach as<br>
  their Great Shepherd had. Only then would they have the peace, the joy and the clear conscience that the<br>
  Spirit of Christ was so desirous to pour out upon them. Paul had let go of Judaism. He left it all, that he too<br>
  might suffer reproach for the sake of Christ. In conclusion, all of the texts lead me to believe that no one<br>
  other than Paul could have or would have written the epistle to the Hebrews.<br>
