        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Welcome to the &quot;Good News for Seventh Day Adventists&quot; section of the <em>Present Truth Magazine</em> web site.  This section is presented by those evangelical Seventh Day Adventist ministers, laymen, administrators, gospel workers, and health care providers who, in their various fields of ministry, believe with all our hearts that our Lord has raised up the Advent movement for a definite purpose.  This purpose is to proclaim to all the world the Good News of justification by faith alone in the perfect sinless life and atoning death of our Lord Jesus Christ in the setting of the final judgment hour. <br>
  
        <br>
          The Gospel we present must be free from all the dross of   apostate Christianity which the apostle Paul called &quot;the man of sin&quot;. This &quot;false pophet&quot; has, by paganizinng the Christian faith, cast down the truth  and made &quot; an image to the beast&quot; of pagan Rome.  It is now time for the truth of the Gospel to be proclaimed as never before in all its purity.  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have sought to pick up each precious gem of Gospel truth, wiped clean from the rubbish of ecclesiastical nonsense, and then place each gem in its proper relation to the blessed Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
      </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
            It is hoped that the material presented here will encourage and strengthen the faith of all the scattered flock of God who are prayerfully and anxiously desiring to see true revival and reformation within the Christian community in general and in the Seventh Day Adventist community in particular.  There are those within and without and on the sidelines of this Christian body who may have temporarily lost sight of our great high calling in Christ and who may wish to recapture a refreshing glimpse of God's eternal purpose in Christ Jesus.  It is to these anxious, prayerful, and weary souls that we dedicate this material. </font></p>
