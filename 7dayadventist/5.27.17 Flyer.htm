Dr. Parker was a world-renowned author of many evolutionary science textbooks who became convinced that the biblical account of creation as found in the book of Genesis was more in line with the scientific data than the theory of Darwinian evolution. Since his conversion to Christ he has spent his entire professional life defending the gospel of Jesus Christ and the literal Genesis account of the six day creation of the world against the false assumptions of the Darwinian theory of biological and geological evolution. <br>
  <br>
Dr. Parker has multiple advanced degrees in biology, genetics, and the physical sciences. Before his conversion to Christ and the truth of biblical creationism he was recognized as a one of the world's leading experts in the field of scientific evolutionary theory. Due to his vast understanding of the arguments of Darwinism he is very able to refute those false evolutionary assumptions with well documented scientific data in support of the biblical cosmology and to defend the biblical plan of salvation through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior, Creator, Lawgiver, and Judge. In these last days of Earth's history the Sabbath day and what it stands for is becoming more and more relevant to the truthfulness of the miracle of the Genesis creation account, the Fall of Man, and the need for the salvation through faith in the doing and dying of our Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary. </span></p>
