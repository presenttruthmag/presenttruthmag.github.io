                           </div>
                           <p align="left">Our Lord Jesus Christ is the promised &quot;Seed of the Woman&quot; (Genesis 3:15)  who has fulfilled all the righteous legal and moral demands of God's Law for us so that in Him all repentant sinners who put their faith in His blood are accounted sinless and righteous in His merciful reckoning even unto the coming of the Lord. From the beginning of life in Christ to the end of life in Christ, the repentant believer in Christ will always confess that he needs the covering of Christ's forgiveness and <em>imputed</em> righteousness. <strong><img src="archive/XLIX/antichrist_clip_image004.jpg" width="269" height="202" align="left"></strong>The Holy Spirit indwells all believers in Christ to empower them and help them to begin to walk in obedience to God's holy Law in sanctified holy living. But the sanctified life of even the most godly of God's people will still need to be covered by the active righteousness (His sinless life) and passive righteousness (His atoning death on the cross of Calvary) of Christ's imputed or &quot;reckoned&quot; righteousness even unto the Last Day when Christ comes again. Thus we  affirm and proclaim the message of &quot;repentance towards God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. This message is a warning and a witness that God is about to destroy all the unbelieving world and that all who refuse to repent, believe the gospel of Christ, and allow Christ to begin to write His Law upon their hearts through the indwelling Holy Spirit will be lost eternally. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong>2.)</strong> We affirm and proclaim the apostolic teaching that the &quot;hour of God's judgment&quot; has come. All the world is being called out of the kingdom of Satan, called spiritual &quot;Babylon&quot;, and being invited to receive the seal of God's justification, forgiveness, and eternal life through faith in the atoning blood of Christ. Those repentant believers who receive the &quot;seal of God&quot; are filled with the Holy Spirit and will acknowledge the Law of God, the Ten Commandments, including the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, as their moral guide in sanctified holy living. The message of the &quot;Three Angels of Revelation 14&quot; is the <u>same</u> message that the apostolic church proclaimed. The Protestant reformation and the Sabbath restoration movement have been raised up in the providence of God to <u>restore</u> this apostolic &quot;judgment hour&quot; message that our Lord Jesus Christ as our High Priest has entered the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary as the one Mediator between God and Man to plead the merits of His blood for all repentant sinners who put their faith in Him. This saving message  is the same message as the early church's apostolic call to repentance towards God and faith in the atoning blood of Jesus Christ. The gift of God is the forgiveness of sin and eternal life by God's unmerited grace alone for all who believe. </p>

                           <p align="left">The<strong> &quot;First Use of the Law&quot;</strong> is to define proper social norms <br> 
                              as a restraint upon lawlessness and crime in society at large.                
                           </p>
                           <p align="left">The bible also affirms and proclaims that the Holy Spirit employs the<strong> "Second Use of the Law"</strong> as a &quot;schoolmaster&quot; to <em>continually</em> define what &quot;sin&quot; is. It convicts us of our sinful nature and our need to repent and call upon the name of Christ for forgiveness. We are <em>continually</em> drawn to Christ by the Holy Spirit to  be forgiven and justified by faith in His sinless life and atoning death on Calvary. Daily the believing repenting Christian will need forgiveness and the <em>imputed</em> righteousness of Christ in <em>justification</em> until the Last Day. The believing Christian also will daily need the <em>imparted</em> enabling grace of the Holy Spirit as he grows in <em>sanctification</em> throughout his earthly life:</p>

                           <p align="left">This side of eternity, the believing people of God will alsways pray in repentance towards God and ask for the forgiveness of sin. We will always need the imputed righteousness of Christ and justification by faith in the sinless life and atoning blood of Christ.</p>
                           <p align="left">The bible also  affirms and proclaims the <strong>"Third Use of the Law" </strong>as a moral guide for the Christian believer which is so important in this lawless diabolical age in which we live. The Holy Spirit in the new covenant promise begins to write the holy Law of God upon the hearts of all repentant believers who are born again through faith in Christ's blood. This impartation of the gift of the indwelling Holy Spirit is called &quot;sanctification&quot; and it is an ongoing growth in Christ throughout our earthly sojourn. The true gospel of Christ rejects any  lawless teaching which denies   the Ten Commandments or any part thereof.</p>
                           <p align="left"><strong><strong><img src="archive/XLIX/49-1_clip_image002.jpg" width="295" height="240" align="left"></strong>4.) </strong>We affirm and proclaim that God <em>truly</em> calls and invites <em>all</em> <em>the world </em>to come to Christ in repentance towards God and faith in Christ as Savior and Lord. He graciously offers forgiveness of sin and the free gift of eternal life to <em>every</em> nation, kindred, tongue and people. God has not predetermined or predestined who will be saved or lost. Christ's sinless life and atoning blood can cover any repentant sinner who calls upon His name. Hyper-Calvinism, Double Predestination, the Augustinian teaching of &quot;limited&quot; atonement and &quot;irresistible&quot; grace for a predetermined elected number of people are rejected as unscriptural. The Holy Spirit attends the proclamation of the gospel and invites <em>all</em> to come to Christ, but His call to repentance and His invitation to salvation are resistible. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><img src="archive/XLIX/49-1_clip_image011.gif" width="425" height="118" align="right"></strong></strong></strong></strong>5.) </strong>We affirm and proclaim the glorious truth of the resurrection of the dead at the Second Coming of Christ as the blessed hope of the believer. The Grecian view of an "immortal soul" which lives on eternally after death is unscriptural. All attempts to contact the dead are forbidden as Satanic and unscriptural.</p>
                           <p align="left"><strong>6.) </strong>We affirm and proclaim the virgin birth of our Lord Jesus Christ and His unique incarnation as <em>fully</em> God and <em>fully</em> man. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are revealed to us in God's word as the three eternal persons of the  Godhead. The Lord Jesus Christ is the One through whom God has created, sustained, and redeemed the world. Arianism and Semi-Arianism are rejected as being false heretical views on the nature of Christ. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong>7.)</strong> We affirm and proclaim the harmony yet distinction of the Law and the Gospel. This harmony yet distinction is a necessary bulwark against the prevailing error of antinomian Dispensationalism which is sweeping through the evangelical Christian world today and foolishly focusing on the Zionist events in the middle east, a rebuilding of the Levitical temple, and a "secrete rapture" of the church. <a href="archive/XIV/14-6.htm#Scofield" target="_blank">Darbyism</a> is rejected as unscriptural.</p>
                           <p align="left"><strong>8.) </strong>We affirm and proclaim the seventh day Sabbath of the fourth commandment of the Decalogue as a memorial to Christ's having created the universe approximately 6,000 years ago in six <em>literal</em> days. The Sabbath is God's emphatic &quot;No!!&quot; to the abomination of Darwinian evolutionism. Sunday sacredness is rejected as unscriptural. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong><img src="archive/XLIX/49-1_clip_image041.gif" width="260" height="336" align="left">9.)</strong> We affirm and proclaim the Biblical truth of the <em>literal</em> fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden as the origin of sin and suffering and death. This truth is denied by all forms of Darwinism including so-called &quot;theistic&quot; evolution and &quot;progressive creationism&quot;. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong>10.)</strong> We affirm and proclaim the existence of a real fallen angel named Lucifer who became Satan along with one third of the angelic host. Satan tempted Eve to believe that she was immortal and that she could ignore the divine warning against eating the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Adam joined Eve in her sin and rebellion and thus they were cast out of Eden. Sin and suffering and death thus came upon the world and the entire human family. However the Lord's plan of forgiveness, redemption and salvation through the promised Seed of the woman was revealed to them and to all the world through repentance towards God and faith in the atoning blood of the Savior, Jesus Christ. </p>
                           <p align="left">Just before the very end of the world, Satan, the deceiver, himself will be permitted to visibly appear and deceptively announce and claim to all the world that he is the true creator, savior, and god of the world. Just as he deceived Eve in the garden of Eden, he will claim that humanity is naturally immortal and that the &quot;immortal soul&quot; of man can never die. Also as the &quot;Lawless One&quot; he will claim that he alone has the authority to determine what is good and what is evil. He will claim to have changed the seventh day Sabbath of the fourth commandment of the holy Law of God. He will demand that all the world must bow down to him and worship him by recognizing Sunday, the first day of the week, as the day to honor him as the creator and savior of the world. In this final world-wide crisis and testing time, this over-powering deception if possible would deceive even God's elect. At this time, in spite of world-wide persecution and threat of death, those bible-believing Christians who keep the true Ten Commandments of God and who trust in the atoning blood of Christ will not be deceived by Satan's end-time lies and deceptions. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong>11.) </strong>We affirm and proclaim a <em>literal</em> world-wide flood approximately 4,000 years ago which destroyed the lawless unbelieving antediluvian world and the saving of Noah and his family by God's unmerited grace. The &quot;local flood&quot; teaching is rejected as unscriptural. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong>12.)</strong> We affirm and proclaim that God will punish and then totally and eternally <em>annihilate</em> sin, Satan, and all unrepentant sinners at the end of the millennium at the final executive judgment rather than punish sinners in an eternally burning hell-fire in unending pain and suffering throughout eternity. Eternally burning hell-fire and unending suffering of the lost is rejected as unscriptural. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong><strong><img src="archive/XLIX/antichrist_clip_image032.jpg" width="247" height="233" align="left"></strong>13.)</strong> We as  true children of the Reformation affirm and proclaim that the papacy is the anti-Christ beast of Revelation 13 and that the truth of the gospel is an ongoing rebuke to the abominable errors of Roman Catholicism<font color="#000000"><strong> &#8212;</strong></font> the intercession of the saints and Mary, transubstantiation, purgatory, priestly absolution of sin, infant baptism, eternal suffering of the lost in hell-fire, Sunday sacredness, the immortality of the soul, and most importantly the error of justification because of  the <em>infused</em> righteousness of the Holy Spirit<em> within</em> the believer rather than justification because of the <em>imputed</em> righteousness of Christ's meritorious sinless life and atoning death on the cross <em>reckoned</em> to the believer.</p>
                           <p align="left"><strong>14.) </strong>We affirm and proclaim the non-immortality of the soul and thus is a rebuke to modern day Spiritualism which seeks to contact and communicate with the dead. The bible teaches that death is a &quot;sleep&quot; until the resurrection of the body. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong>15.)</strong> We affirm and proclaim <em>adult</em> baptism by <em>immersion</em> for all repentant sinners who put their faith in the atoning death of Christ on the cross. Infant baptism by sprinkling is rejected as unbiblical sacramentalism. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong>16.</strong> We affirm and  proclaim that in the Old Testament &quot;Day of Atonement&quot; ceremony the goat chosen to be &quot;sacrificed for the Lord&quot; which was slain and whose blood was carried into the Most Holy Place of the Levitical temple foreshadowed and symbolically represented the Lord Jesus Christ and His shed blood on Calvary. His shed blood &quot;vicariously&quot; or substitutionally atones for the guilt and sins of God's people. The second goat called the scapegoat or <a href="Bible/Azazel.html" target="_blank">Azazel</a> goat which was not sacrificed in the ritual, but rather is led out into the wilderness to die, symbolically represents the punishment and destruction of Satan and all the unbelieving world. They atone for their own sins by being punished and destroyed outside of the New Jerusalem after the 1000 years are fulfilled.</p>
                           <p align="left"><strong><strong><img src="archive/XLIX/49-1_clip_image015.jpg" width="129" height="348" align="right"></strong>17.)</strong> We affirm and proclaim that at the second coming of the Lord, He will raise from the dead all those who have called upon His name since the Fall of Adam. At the coming of the Lord, He will not touch down upon the earth, but rather the believing saints who are alive at His coming will be &quot;caught up&quot; together with the resurrected saints to meet the Lord in the air. The unbelievers who are alive at His coming will be destroyed by the brightness of His coming. Satan and his fallen angels will then be bound to the desolated earth for 1,000 years. During this time Christ and the saved in heaven will determine the punishment to be meted out to Satan and each of the fallen angels, and also to those unbelievers throughout history who refused to repent and call upon the name of the Lord. At the end of the 1,000 years of the Millennium, Christ and the redeemed will descent in the New Jerusalem down to the desolated earth. All of the lost throughout the ages will then be raised from the dead. Satan will deceive them again into believing that they can attack and defeat those who are within the walls of the New Jerusalem. But as they approach the holy city, fire will rain down upon them from heaven. They will all then be punished according to the <a href="verses-noframes/few%20stripes.htm" target="_blank">measure</a> of their lawless deeds during their lifetime and then finally be consumed. Satan himself along with his demons will be totally destroyed and annihilated forever. The earth will then be recreated in Edenic beauty as it was before the fall of Adam and the entrance of sin and death. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong><strong><img src="archive/XLIX/49-1_clip_image026.jpg" width="201" height="348" align="left"></strong>18.)</strong> We affirm and proclaim that all of the natural-born children of Adam inherit a fallen sinful nature with inherited propensities to sin and selfishness. This sinful moral and legal inheritance from Adam is called <a href="7th%20day%20Sabbath-keepers/SDAPart2/1.html#OriginalSinAnchor" target="_blank">Original Sin</a>. Christ's human nature which was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary did not inherit this fallen sinful human nature and propensity to sin. He was tempted in all points as are we, yet He was without sin or any inclination to sin. </p>
                           <p align="left">Christ's deity and divine nature as the Son of God who has always existed from all eternity, with no beginning or end, was incarnated in the person of the man, Jesus Christ. Only Christ's human nature was conceived by the Holy Spirit in the virgin Mary. The incarnate Christ was and is and will always be fully God and fully man. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong>19.)</strong> We affirm and proclaim that the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper are <em>symbolic</em> of the body and blood of our Lord. The bread and wine are a <em>remembrance</em> of the Lord's sinless life and atoning death on the cross and proclaim the gospel of the forgiveness of sin until He comes again. Transubstantiation and Consubstantiation are rejected as unscriptural. </p>
                           <p align="left"><strong>20.)</strong> And finally we affirm and proclaim that the Bible alone is the final authority in all matters of doctrine and faith.</p>

No repentant believer in the Lord Jesus Christ can ever be lost so long as we <a href="verses-noframes/continue_to_believe.htm" target="_blank">continue to trust</a> only in the sinless life and atoning death of the Lord Jesus Christ unto the end of our lives or until Jesus comes in the clouds of heaven on the Last Day. There will never be a point in our lives where we will not need to be legally justified by God's unmerited grace alone through faith in the imputed righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ. Any repentant believer in Christ who afterwards falls away from repentance towards God and faith in Christ as his Savior and Lord will lose his hope of eternal life unless he repents of his high-handed willful sins and returns to faith. </font></p>

Death has been swallowed up in victory through the blood of Calvary !!!And so death for believing repentant sinners is a mere moment of sleep from which <a href="verses-noframes/resurrection-dead.htm" target="_blank">we shall arise</a> to be like Him. In a moment&nbsp;&#8212; in the twinkling of an eye&nbsp;&#8212; we shall put on perfect righteousness and immortality at the Last Trump. Just as in water baptism Christians are "buried" in the likeness of our Lord's death and "arise" in the likeness of His resurrection, even so we who fall asleep in death shall arise on the Last Day to everlasting life through the promise of the resurrection. </font></p>

                     <p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the Jew it was most important that he could prove he was a son of Abraham, for &quot;to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.&quot; Gal. 3:16. The Pharisees were certain of being part of the Israel of God because they could trace their physical descent back to Abraham. John the Baptist declared that they were resting on a false confidence. &quot;. . . think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father,&quot; he warned them, &quot;for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.&quot; Matt. 3:9. Mere physical descent would give them no claim on God and no right to be included in the Israel of God. <em><br>
                        <br>
                        </em>        Again, the Pharisees said to Jesus, &quot;Abraham is our father.&quot; John 8:39. But Jesus denied their confident claim, saying, &quot;It ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.&quot; John 8:39. Jesus categorically denied that they were children of Abraham. <em><br>
                        <br>
                        </em>When Zaccheus showed by his works that he had the faith of Abraham, Jesus declared, &quot;Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.&quot; Luke 19:9 RSV Jesus was not saying that Zaccheus was saved because he was a physical descendant of Abraham-for there were many Jews in Palestine who were not saved. Jesus was saying that Zaccheus' faith constituted him a real son of Abraham. The Lord could have said to him, as he said to the repentant woman, &quot;Thy faith hath saved thee . . .&quot; Luke 7:50. Again, Jesus greeted Nathaniel with the salutation, &quot;Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!&quot; John 1:47. The word &quot;indeed&quot; signifies a true, or real, Israelite. Jesus therefore declared that a real Israelite is a man &quot;in whom is no guile.&quot; According to Psalm 32, the guileless man is not a sinless man but the man who honestly continues to confess his sinfulness and who finds forgiveness at the hand of a merciful God. St. Paul cites Psalm 32 and shows that this guileless man (the Israelite &quot;indeed&quot;) is the man who is justified by faith (see Rom. 4:1-8). <em><br>
                        <br>
                        </em>The clear teaching of Jesus about the real Israel of God is found also in the epistles of His great apostle. Could words be clearer than the following?: </font>

                        <br>
                        </em>God made promises to the seed of Abraham. The Jews are still waiting for God to carry out His promises to them, and more amazing, many Christians are now waiting for God to carry out His promises to the Jewish nation as the seed of Abraham. This is what happens when people read the Old Testament without the light and interpretation of the New Testament. Now let us get two simple facts straight once and for all:<strong>1. </strong>God made promises to Abraham's seed (Gal. 3:19 ). <strong>2.</strong> Christ is the Seed of Abraham. (&quot;Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of One, And to thy Seed, which is Christ.&quot;) This is why Christ is called the Mediator of the covenant. It is only by Him, in Him and through Him that God carries out any of His promises to Abraham. The Seed of Abraham is Jesus Christ. It includes all who are in Christ and excludes all outside of Christ. So the apostle affirms: </font>

                     <p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the apostle declares, &quot;And so all Israel shall be saved . . ." (Rom. 11:26 ), he is certainly not teaching us that every member of the Jewish race will be saved. But the seed of Israel shall be saved - that is to say, all those who are in Jesus Christ - and not one shall be lost. <br>
                        <br>
                        Neither Jesus nor Paul is speaking in mere allegories when they tell us who are the children of Abraham. They are telling us who are real children of Abraham. Abraham was justified by faith and therefore became the father of Israel . All who are justified by faith are real children of Abraham (Gal. 3:8). The Seed of Israel is Jesus Christ. He is also the &quot;King of the Jews.&quot; If a man is related to Jesus Christ, who can deny that he is a real Jew according to the Scriptures? For those who believe in Jesus Christ are born again (1 John 5:1), and they actually partake of the nature of Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:4). <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>The Gentile Church Not a Separate Identity </strong><br>
                        <br>
                        The Judaisers at Galatia were contending that the Gentiles had to become children of Abraham by means of certain changes in their flesh. The apostle Paul did not dispute the necessity of Gentiles becoming part of the Israel of God. Indeed, &quot;all Israel shall be saved,&quot; and only Israel - for as Jesus said, &quot;salvation is of the Jews.&quot; John 4:22. The apostle refuted the wrong method of trying to incorporate the Gentiles into the Israel of God. His message was clear: Abraham was justified by faith, and every Gentile who is justified by faith becomes a son of Abraham (Gal. 3:8). The promises were made to the seed of Abraham, and Christ is that Seed. Therefore, all who are truly baptized into Christ are in Christ and are part of Abraham's seed (Gal. 3:28 , 29). Those who have become new creatures by faith in Jesus and walk according to the rule of faith are &quot;the Israel of God.&quot; Gal. 6:15,16. <br>
                        <br>
                        Gentiles who believe the gospel become &quot;fellow heirs&quot; with the faithful Jews. They do not make up a separate body, but they become &quot;.fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ by the gospel ...&quot; Eph. 3:6. The Gentiles, &quot;being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them [the Jews], and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree . . . &quot; Rom. 11:17 . Once &quot;aliens from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of promise,&quot; the Gentiles are &quot;made nigh by the blood of Christ.&quot; Eph. 2:12-13. Being now children of Abraham, part of the commonwealth of Israel and partakers of God's promises to Israel , believing Gentiles make up &quot;the house of Israel &quot; to whom the new covenant promise is given: </font>

Heb. 8:10. </font></blockquote>
                        <span class="style100"></span>

                     <p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Israel of God are all those who are in Jesus Christ, the Seed of Abraham, the King of the Jews, the One to whom the promises were made. And in Jesus Christ all national distinctions are broken down. &quot;. . . there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek . . .&quot; Rom. 10:12 .&quot;... ye are all one in Christ Jesus.&quot; Gal. 3:28. &quot;There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism . . .&quot; Eph 4:4-5. Therefore, in the things of the gospel any national distinctions deny the reality of the atonement of Jesus Christ (Eph. 2:14 -17) and are a Judaising perversion of the New Testament message. There are some who take pride in their &quot;literal&quot; interpretation of the things of prophecy, especially Old Testament prophecy. No sound Bible scholar will deny that the Bible should be read in its historical-grammatical sense or that &quot;literal wherever possible&quot; is a good rule. But many prophecies of the Old Testament cannot be taken with strict literalness. The stone of stumbling to both houses of Israel was not a literal stone but Jesus Christ. Malachi's Elijah was not literally Elijah but John the Baptist. Many more examples could be given, but our point is this: How would we know the true interpretation without the New Testament? Does not the gospel determine our use of the Old Testament? <em><br>
                        <br>
                        </em>Besides, a crass literalness is in keeping with the method of interpretation employed by the Pharisees. When Jesus gave a non-literal application to the Messianic prophecy about delivering the captives, they were angry. They refused to have anything to do with His spiritual kingdom, which could be seen and entered only by those who were born again. When Jesus spoke of destroying the temple and raising it up again, they insisted on giving His words a literal meaning. Jesus even had to rebuke his disciples for taking literally his warning, &quot; . . . beware of the leaven of the Pharisees . . . &quot; Matt. 16:11. Because they thought Jesus spoke about literal bread, He asked, &quot;Do ye not yet understand . . .?&quot; Matt. 16:9. <br>
                        <em><strong><br>
                        </strong></em><strong>The New Israel </strong><br>
                        <br>
                        Just as the Bible presents an old covenant and a new covenant, so it presents an old Israel and a new Israel. The old Israel was constituted under the twelve tribes named after the twelve sons of Jacob. When Jesus chose twelve apostles, He was taking steps to constitute the Christian church. Yet why did he deliberately choose twelve apostles? And why did the apostle James address the church as &quot;the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad&quot;? James 1:11. It was because the New Testament church, comprised of Jews and Gentiles, constituted the new Israel of God. <em><br>
                        <br>
                        </em>When Christ died on the cross, national distinctions were ended. The old national religious economy was as extinct as the old covenant. Henceforth the Christian church, founded on the teachings of the twelve apostles, would be the new Israel , the inheritor of all the promises and responsibilities of Israel of the Old Testament. <em><br>
                        <br>
                        </em><strong>Conclusion </strong><br>
                        <em><br>
                        </em>Abraham was justified by faith (Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3). Just as Abraham had two sons &#8212; Ishmael and Isaac &#8212; so there were always two classes of Jews. Not all were true sons of Abraham. The prophets frequently referred to the faithful remnant, who were the real children of Abraham. <br>
                        <br>
                        Finally, at the time of the apostles there was a saved &quot;remnant according to the election of grace&quot; (Rom. 9:27 ; 11:5). This remnant were those who welcomed their Messiah and were justified by faith in Jesus. God's word had not failed (Rom. 9:6). These alone were the lineage of Isaac, and the rest were counted as Ishmaelites - illegitimate children. All Israel - that is, all who were justified by faith - would be saved according to God's promise, which could never fail (Rom. 11:26 ). And all from among the Gentiles who would believe on Christ and be justified by faith would become children of Abraham. There is one way of salvation, one body, one faith, one baptism. Christ is the Seed of Abraham. The promises of God are by Him, to Him, through Him and in Him. He is the Elect One (Isa. 42:1), and the chosen people are those who are chosen in Him (Eph. 1:4)</font>

                     Dietary supplementation with a daily dose of a multivitamin / mineral, vitamin C, vitamin D3, magnesium, zinc, and calcium supplements would be greatly beneficial in avoiding the serious symptoms of bacterial and viral infections and Covid19 type pandemics. Consuming refined sugar in one's diet suppresses the immune system's ability to resist infection and also causes vascular inflammation leading to heart disease, diabetes and many autoimmune diseases.</font>
