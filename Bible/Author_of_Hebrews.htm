<span class="style3">Was Paul the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews?

<br>
I hope all is well with you and that you are full of happiness and joy in Christ. <br>

I was reading through the epistle to the Hebrews today and noticed this verse which jumped out at me which clearly shows that Paul was indeed the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews: </span></span>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style8 style9"><strong>Hebrews 10:34</strong>  For ye had compassion of me in <strong>my</strong> <strong>bonds</strong>, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style8">Notice that the text refers to "<strong>my</strong> <strong>bonds</strong>". Paul throughout his many  other epistles makes frequent reference to his "<strong>bonds</strong>." Notice the following texts referring to his bonds. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style10"><strong>Acts 20:16-29</strong> For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. 17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. 18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, 19 Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: 20 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, 21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: 23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that <strong>bonds</strong> and afflictions abide me. 24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. 25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. 26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. 27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. 28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. 29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. </p>
  <p class="style10"><strong>Acts 25:14</strong> And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left <strong>in bonds</strong> by Felix: </p>
  <p class="style10"><strong>Acts 26:29-31</strong>  And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these <strong>bonds</strong>. 30 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 31 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of <strong>bonds</strong>. </p>
  <p class="style10"><strong>Ephesians 6:20</strong>  For which I am an ambassador <strong>in</strong> <strong>bonds</strong>: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. </p>
  <p class="style10"><strong>Philippians 1:7</strong>  Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in <strong>my</strong> <strong>bonds</strong>, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. </p>
  <p class="style10"><strong>Philippians 1:13-16</strong>  So that <strong>my</strong> <strong>bonds</strong> in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places; 14 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by <strong>my</strong> <strong>bonds</strong>, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. 15 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 16 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to <strong>my</strong> <strong>bonds</strong>: </p>
  <p class="style10"><strong>Colossians 4:18</strong>  The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember <strong>my</strong> <strong>bonds</strong>. Grace be with you. Amen. </p>
  <p class="style10"><strong>2 Timothy 2:9</strong>  Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto <strong>bonds</strong>; but the word of God is not bound. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style10">Another reason that I believe that Paul was the author of the epistle to the Hebrews is his use of the phrase, &quot;The just shall live by faith.&quot; Continuing on in Hebrew 10:34 we find the phrase in the following text: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style10"><strong>Hebrews 10:35-39</strong> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. 36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. 37 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. 38 <strong>Now the just shall live by faith:</strong> but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. 39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style8">This phrase <strong>"Now the just shall live by faith"</strong> is the great confession of faith that Paul also uses in Romans 1:17 and Galatians 3:11. <em>Only</em> Paul used this unique expression in his epistles. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style10"><strong>Romans 1:16-18</strong>  For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, <strong>The just shall live by faith.</strong> 18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; </p>
  <p class="style10"><strong>Galatians 3:11</strong> But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, <strong>The just shall live by faith. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style8">Now notice the final benediction that the author of Hebrews gives: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style10"><strong>Hebrews 13:23-25</strong>  Know ye that <strong>our brother Timothy</strong> is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. 24 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you. 25 Grace be with you all. Amen. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style8">Timothy is mentioned nine times in the New Testament. Each time Timothy is associated <em>only</em> with Paul and never with any of the other writers of the New Testament. </p>
<p class="style8">The final overwhelming evidence that Paul is the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews is the author's thorough acquaintance with all of the events of the Old Testament and the Temple Service of the Levitical Priesthood and the Covenants. Paul was a lawyer educated by the Pharisees in the school of Gamaliel. None of the other disciples of the Lord were so well educated in the teachings of the Torah. The Greek that we find in Hebrews and the well laid out precision of argument used are those of a careful thoroughly educated intellectual which only Paul the attorney could have constructed for his Hebrew listeners.&nbsp;It is for these reasons that I have come to the conclusion that Paul is the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. </p>
