<p class="style1 style3"><strong>Papal Lord's Day Quotes</strong></p>
<p class="style1">Sunday interest began to accelerate in 1985, when a revision to&nbsp;<em>The Roman Catechism </em>was published by Pope John Paul II:&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center" class="style1">&quot;The civil authorities [government] should be urged to cooperate with the church in maintaining and strengthening this public worship of God [referring to Sunday], and to support with their own authority the regulations set down by the church's pastors.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;For it is only in this that the faithful will understand why it is Sunday and not the Sabbath day that we now keep holy.&quot; 5 &nbsp; <br>
    <span class="style5">5 <em>The Roman Catechism &mdash; </em>1985.</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style1">In an apostolic letter, <em>Dies Domini</em>, Pope John Paul II wrote:&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center" class="style1">66. &quot;In this matter, my predecessor Pope Leo XIII in his Encyclical Rerum Novarum spoke of Sunday rest as a worker's right which the State must guarantee.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="center" class="style1">67. &quot;Therefore, also in the particular circumstances of our own time, Christians will naturally strive to ensure that civil legislation respects their duty to keep Sunday holy.&quot; 6 <br>

<p class="style1 style2">Pope Benedict XVI comes on the scene:&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">July 25, 2005: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center" class="style1">&quot;Saturday is 'no longer' the worship day of God, only on Sunday can we become part of the body of Christ in the world, only by worshiping on Sunday can we avoid 'egoistic isolation' and instead be united 'in a great&nbsp; community ... a universal community' becoming 'related to everyone in the&nbsp; world.'&quot; 9 &nbsp; <br>

<p align="left" class="style1">Pope Benedict addressed the occasion: </p>
<p align="center" class="style1">&quot;Social disorder, war, injustice and violence&quot; can only be&nbsp;countered &quot;by renewed appreciation and respect for the&nbsp;universal moral law [the Decalogue], that only by&nbsp;recognizing that law can the world have dignity, life and&nbsp;freedom.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">Only if the world recognized: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center" class="style1">&quot;that law, can the world have 'dignity, life and freedom' with 'conditions of justice and peace' in all the communities of the world, and that the promotion and defense of this law is what 'must govern relations between nations and peoples in the pursuit of the common good of the human family ... within the international community.' &quot;In a &quot;Sunday Law&quot; lies the &quot;hope&quot; of mankind!&nbsp; We have respect for the Ten Commandments, it is the key to international conflict. It will bring peace and a &quot;common good.&quot; <span class="style5"><br>

<p align="left" class="style1">November 27, 2006: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center" class="style1">&quot;People cannot be sanctified except on Sunday [because] Christ transferred Sabbath sacredness to Sunday, that only those who keep Sunday belong to Christ, that only on Sunday does the risen Lord makes himself present among his followers, that only these worship God properly, and that may&nbsp;Sunday regain all its importance.&quot; 10 &nbsp; <br>

</blockquote>
<p align="left" class="style1">September 9, 2007: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center" class="style1">&quot;Without the Lord's day, we cannot live. That meeting with the Lord only occurs on the 'specific day' of Sunday, that life does not flourish without Sunday, and that Sunday is a day of rest, of freedom and equality for all the world.&quot; 11&nbsp; <br>

</blockquote>
<p align="left" class="style1">Pope Francis created a fascinating argument to support Sunday rest:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center" class="style1">&quot;Christ establishes a new covenant between God and man, the old law is fulfilled and no longer necessary.&quot; &quot;Christ's flesh, not the old law, is the bridge from man  to God.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left" class="style1">Pope Francis concluded by saying that he hoped &quot;the examples of Jesus' love and closeness in the Gospel can help modern-day Christians from&nbsp;sliding into hypocrisy.&quot; 15</p>
