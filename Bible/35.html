              </b><font size="3">The topic of military service and how one personally relates ones faith in Christ with serving in combat has always been one of great debate within the Christian Church. These decisions are in a very gray area where some will decide to be 1-A-0 and some will decide to be 1-0 and some will be 1-A. During the Viet Nam war, many Christian men were torn between wanting to serve their country and yet not wanting to participate in a war which they felt was absolutely not where the United States should be involved. Now, 30 years later, even the Secretary of Defense MacNamara has admitted that the war was sheer folly.  Most Christian young men certainly are patriotic citizens who would be willing to fight and die to defend their country. The question lies in how to define a &quot;just&quot; war which actually is a war which &quot;defends ones country&quot;.<br>
    
        <br>
            The military forces of the large nations have always been the tool of the politicians for enforcing global political objectives. England used her navy to dominate and colonize nearly all of the 19th century world. Were the wars in India where the British soldiers fought and died just wars? What about the wars in Africa which subjugated entire nations? What about the constant wars of the Middle Ages and the wars called the Crusades to free the &quot;Holy Land&quot;.   It is regarding these kind of wars that the Christian man must ask himself if this is where God would want him to fight. We must continually ask ourselves WHY are we fighting in a certain war. Should a Christian merely submit to the decisions of politicians and fight every time they say to go and take up arms to achieve their political goals?<br>
    
        <br>
    
Many Christians in Germany who refused to fight for the Kaiser in WWI were shot or imprisoned.<br>
    
<br>
    To some, the issue is cut and dry and they will not allow any other position to even be discussed without charges of &quot;cowardice&quot;. But to say that those who left the country during the Viet Nam war were cowards who were full of self interest would be misjudging the motives of most of these men.  During the American Civil War, Christian young men who were opposed to the war  paid the $400 tax imposed on those who stayed out.  These decisions will always confront Christian young men.  There will always be wars.<br>
    
<br>
    
Having said this however we are left to the matter of deciding what to do in the event of a call to fight a war which one considers an unjust war. The draft boards will not allow a draftee to decide whether a war is just or unjust. If one is registered 1-A then one must serve in the armed forces and fight in any war that the leaders of the country decide that the armed forces shall fight in.<br>
    
<br>
    
Thus the individual who is drafted has only a few options. He can fight in a war that he feels is an unjust war, he can refuse to fight and face a court marshal, or he can refuse to fight, not answer the draft call, and flee the country.  Many who were drafted during the Viet Nam war left the country and went to Canada or Central America. I met many of these men who fled the country when I was working in Central America as a public health worker. Some lived on the beaches in their vans, moved around a lot, and depended on their parents to send money.<br>
    
<br>
    
Well, these are the choices that the young draft age Christian can make when he is called up to fight. The decision is his alone of course, but I only pray that he never has to make such a decision.</font><b><br>
