        <font face="Arial" size="3">Please read and understand these verses:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Romans 8:1 &quot;There is NOW no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This means that all who are trusting in the forgiveness of Christ will be daily in conflict with sin and seeking to walk in the way of God's will. This does not mean that Christians are sinless, but all who name the name of Christ are <em>seeking</em> to be sinless in their lives, not to be saved by good works, but rather because they are living under the banner of the Cross. No Christian is without sin, but we have committed our hearts and lives to His service and are striving against willful sin and continually trusting in the mercy of God and His gracious covering of our shortcomings with His perfect righteousness. There is no condemnation unto death when we stumble and fall into sin. The only sin which is unto death is the sin for which we do not ask forgiveness.  As we daily walk in forgiveness, God picks us up, washes us in the blood of Christ and bids us to go on in the Way. Forgetting the things that are past, we press on toward the mark of our high calling in Christ Jesus. I urge you to be comforted with these promises and find rest for your soul in Christ Jesus.</font></p>
