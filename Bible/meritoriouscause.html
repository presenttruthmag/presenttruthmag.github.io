  What sinners <u>must do</u> to be personally saved from sin and death. (the &quot;instrumental&quot; cause) </span></span><span class="style1 style14"></span><span class="style1 style9"><br>

<p class="style11"><span class="style1 style7"><img src="../archive/XXIV/24pg09d.gif" width="388" height="220" align="right"></span>The good news message of the bible teaches us that the sinless life and atoning death of our Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary are what  God <u>has done</u> to save the world from sin and death. The word of God also teaches us that personal repentance towards God and personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ are what each of us <u> must  do</u>  to be saved from sin. </p>
<p class="style11">The Holy Spirit convicts all the world of sin and righteousness and judgment to come. The Holy Spirit  empowers  the gospel <em>invitation</em> to everyone in the world to personally repent of their sins and to call upon Christ as the Savior and Lord of one's life. Those  who repent and believe in Him   can be assured of  the free gift of the forgiveness of sin and everlasting life.</p>
<blockquote class="style5">
  <p class="style12">John 16:8 When He (the Holy Spirit) comes, He will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment (condemnation): </p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style9">Acts 20:20-21  And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house, Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks,<strong> repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style11">Thus, the word of God teaches us that Jesus Christ is <em>both</em> our Savior <em>and</em> our Lord. If He is not both then He is neither. He delivers us from the <em>penalty  </em>of sin, and He also begins to daily deliver us from the <em>power of sin</em> in our  lives. </p>
<p class="style11"><strong><span class="style1 style7"><img src="../graphics/6-8sm.gif" width="200" height="142" align="left"></span>The atoning work of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary is the reason that God can forgive and save sinners: </strong>The sinless life and atoning death of Christ on the cross has given God <u>the legal right</u> to bring forgiveness and  eternal life to all the world. This means that without any of our good works of obedience and righteousness, the repentant believing sinner who trusts  in the sinless life and atoning death of Christ on Calvary is forgiven, legally justified, and reckoned as righteous before God on the basis of Christ's atoning blood.</p>
<p class="style11"><strong>Repentance towards God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ brings sinners to personal salvation:</strong> The Holy Spirit convicts sinners of their sins and leads condemned lost sinners to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ's atoning work on the cross. The Spirit invites all who hear the gospel invitation to call upon the name of Christ for the free gift of forgiveness and eternal life. This free gift of  forgiveness  and eternal life is promised to all who heed the invitation to come to Christ. This is called &quot;justification by faith&quot;. All who call upon the name of Jesus Christ  will then respond to the Holy Spirit's call to be baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. All believers in Christ  are born again to the newness of life as they receive the free gift of the indwelling Holy Spirit. The indwelling Holy Spirit  urges the Christian believer    to daily call upon the Lord in repentance and  forgiveness of sin. Faith in Christ as Savior and Lord always begins to be followed by good works and a daily yielding of one's life in obedience to the commandments of God. Growing in love for God and brotherly love for one's neighbor are the work of a lifetime. All true believers in Christ will begin to live in submission to God's moral Law, the Ten Commandments. </p>

  <p class="style3"><span class="style9">Luke 6:46-49 "But why do you call Me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do the things which I say? "Whoever comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them, I will show you whom he is like: "He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently against that house, and could not shake it, for it was founded on the rock. "But he who heard and did nothing is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream beat vehemently; and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great." </span></p>

For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.

And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.  But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. For the king knows of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.  King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuades me to be a Christian.

<p class="style5"><font face="Arial"><strong>Summary:</strong> For all have sinned and continually fall short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth as a propitiation by faith in His blood through faith to demonstrate His righteousness that He might be just and the justifier of the repentant sinner who has faith in Jesus. To him who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness. Righteousness shall be imputed to us who believe in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered up because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification. <br>

Any &quot;gospel&quot; which denies that our forgiveness and acceptance with God are made possible only through faith  in the  sinless life and atoning shed blood of Christ alone is a denial of the true meaning of the Cross and robs us of our assurance and confidence before the holiness of God. </font></p>
