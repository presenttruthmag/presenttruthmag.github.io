  </span><span class="style17">Refuting Robert Wieland, Jack Sequeira and the &quot;1888 Study Committee&quot; who falsely teach that all humanity died on the cross <u>with</u> Christ. They deny the vicarious substitutionary death of Christ on the Cross and they teach that all the world was crucified mysteriously <u>with</u> Christ on the cross.

  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>1 Corinthians 1:23 </strong></span>23 But <strong>we preach Christ crucified </strong>, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Romans 5:8-11 </strong></span>8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, <strong>Christ died for us. </strong>9 Much more then, being now <strong>justified by his blood </strong>, we shall be saved from wrath through him. 10 For if, when we were enemies, <strong>we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son </strong>, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. 11 And not only <em>so </em>, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. </p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Romans 3:24-25 </strong></span>24 Being justified freely by his grace through <strong>the redemption that is in Christ Jesus </strong>: 25 Whom God hath set forth <em>to be </em><strong>a propitiation through faith in his blood </strong>, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>1 Corinthians 10:16 </strong></span>16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of <strong>the blood of Christ </strong>? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the <strong>body of Christ </strong>?</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>1 Corinthians 11:23-29 </strong></span>That the Lord Jesus the <em>same </em>night in which he was betrayed took bread: 24 And when he had given thanks, he brake <em>it </em>, and said, Take, eat: this is <strong>my body, which is broken for you </strong>: this do in remembrance of me. 25 After the same manner also <em>he took </em>the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is <strong>the new testament in my blood </strong>: this do ye, as oft as ye drink <em>it </em>, in remembrance of me. 26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, <strong>ye do show the Lord's death till he come </strong>. 27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink <em>this </em>cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of <em>that </em>bread, and drink of <em>that </em>cup. 29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Ephesians 1:6-7 </strong></span>6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. 7 In whom <strong>we have redemption through his blood, </strong> the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>1 Timothy 2:5-6 </strong></span>5 For <em>there is </em>one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man <strong>Christ Jesus; 6 Who gave himself a ransom for all </strong>, to be testified in due time. </p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Ephesians 2:13 </strong></span>13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are <strong>made nigh by the blood of Christ </strong>.</p>
  <p class="style1"> <span class="style4">1 Corinthians 15:1 </span>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that <strong>Christ died for our sins </strong> according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Galatians 1:3-5 </strong></span>5.....our Lord Jesus Christ, 4 <strong>Who gave himself for our sins </strong>, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: 5 To whom <em>be </em>glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Hebrews 1:3 </strong></span>3 Who being the brightness of <em>his </em>glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, <strong>when he had by himself purged our sins </strong>, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Hebrews 2:17 </strong></span>17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto <em>his </em>brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things <em>pertaining </em>to God, to <strong>make reconciliation for the sins of the people </strong>.</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Hebrews 9:11 - 10:1 </strong></span>1 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; 12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, <strong>but by his own blood </strong> he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption <em>for us </em>. 13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: 14 How much more shall <strong>the blood of Christ </strong>, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? 15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, <strong>that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions </strong><em>that were </em>under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. 16 For where a testament <em>is </em>, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. 17 For a testament <em>is </em>of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. 18 Whereupon neither the first <em>testament </em>was dedicated without blood. 19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, 20 Saying, This <em>is </em>the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. 21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. 22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and <strong>without shedding of blood is no remission </strong>. 23 <em>It was </em>therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, <em>which are </em>the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: 25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; 26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but <strong>now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself . </strong>27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: 28 So <strong>Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many </strong>; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Hebrews 10:10 </strong></span>10 By the which will we are sanctified <strong>through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once <em>for all </em>.</strong></p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Hebrews 10:12-14 </strong></span>12 But this man, <strong>after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever </strong>, sat down on the right hand of God; 13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. 14 For <strong>by one offering </strong> he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Hebrews 10:19 </strong></span>19 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest <strong>by the blood of Jesus </strong></p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style10">Hebrews 10: 29</span> 29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted <strong>the blood of the covenant </strong>, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Hebrews 13:12 </strong></span>12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might <strong>sanctify the people with his own blood </strong>, suffered without the gate.</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Hebrews 13:20 </strong></span>20 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, <strong>through the blood of the everlasting covenant,</strong></p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>1 Peter 1:18-21 </strong></span>18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, <em>as </em>silver and gold, from your vain conversation <em>received </em>by tradition from your fathers; 19 <strong>But with the precious blood of Christ </strong>, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: 20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, 21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>2 Peter 2:1 </strong></span> But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even <strong>denying the Lord that bought them </strong>, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>1 John 1:7 </strong></span>7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the <strong>blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style10">1 John 2:1-2</span> And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 2 And <strong>he is the propitiation for our sins </strong>: and not for ours only, but also for <em>the sins of </em>the whole world.</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>1 John 4:9-10 </strong></span>9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and <strong>sent his Son <em>to be </em>the propitiation for our sins </strong>. </p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Colossians 1:13-22 </strong></span>13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated <em>us </em>into the kingdom of his dear Son: 14 In whom <strong>we have redemption through his blood </strong>, <em>even </em>the forgiveness of sins: 15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: 16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether <em>they be </em>thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: 17 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. 18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all <em>things </em>he might have the preeminence. 19 For it pleased <em>the Father </em>that in him should all fullness dwell; 20 And, <strong>having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself </strong>; by him, <em>I say </em>, whether <em>they be </em>things in earth, or things in heaven. 21 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in <em>your </em>mind by wicked works, yet <strong>now hath he reconciled 22 In the body of his flesh through death </strong>, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Titus 2:13-14 </strong></span>13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 14 Who <strong>gave himself for us </strong>, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Revelation 1:5 </strong></span>5 And from Jesus Christ, <em>who is </em>the faithful witness, <em>and </em>the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and <strong>washed us from our sins in his own blood, </strong></p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Revelation 5:9 </strong></span>9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: <strong>for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood </strong> out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; </p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Luke 22:19-20 </strong></span>19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake <em>it </em>, and gave unto them, saying, <strong>This is my body which is given for you </strong>: this do in remembrance of me. 20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, <strong>This cup <em>is </em>the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you. </strong></p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>John 6:53-61 </strong></span>53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye <strong>eat the flesh </strong> of the Son of man, and drink <strong>his blood </strong>, ye have no life in you. 54 <strong>Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life </strong>; and I will raise him up at the last day. 55 For <strong>my flesh </strong> is meat indeed, and <strong>my blood </strong> is drink indeed. 56 <strong>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. </strong>57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. 58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever. 59 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum . 60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard <em>this </em>, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? 61 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you? </p>

<p class="style5"><span class="style3"><strong><span class="style9"><span class="style15">Part 2.</span> The repentant  forgiven believer in Christ dies <u><strong>to</strong></u><strong> sin , not <u>for</u> sin.</strong></span></strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style10">NKJ Romans 6:1 </span> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? 2 Certainly not! How shall <strong>we who died to sin </strong> live any longer in it? 3 Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were <strong>baptized into His death </strong>? 4 Therefore we were buried with Him <strong>through baptism into death </strong>, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so <strong>we also should walk in newness of life. </strong>5 For if we have been united together <strong>in the likeness of His death </strong>, certainly we also shall be <em>in the likeness </em>of <em>His </em>resurrection, 6 knowing this, that <strong>our old man was crucified with <em>Him </em></strong><em>, </em>that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. 7 For <strong>he who has died </strong> has been freed from sin. 8 Now if we <strong>died with Christ </strong>, we believe that we shall also live with Him, 9 knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. 10 For <em>the death </em>that He died, He died to sin once for all; but <em>the life </em>that He lives, He lives to God. 11 Likewise you also, <strong>reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</strong><strong>12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. </strong>13 And do not present your members <em>as </em>instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but <strong>present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead </strong>, and your members <em>as </em>instruments of righteousness to God.</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Galatians 2:17 </strong></span> &quot;But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, <em>is </em>Christ therefore a minister of sin? Certainly not! 18 &quot;For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. 19 &quot;For I through the law <strong>died to the law </strong> that I might live to God. 20 &quot; <strong>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the <em>life </em>which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. </strong>21 &quot;I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness <em>comes </em>through the law, then <strong>Christ died </strong> in vain.&quot; </p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Romans 12:1 </strong></span> I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye <strong>present your bodies a living sacrifice </strong>, holy, acceptable unto God, <em>which is </em>your reasonable service. 2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what <em>is </em>that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>
  <p class="style1"><span class="style4"><strong>Luke 9:23 </strong></span>23 And he said to <em>them </em>all, If any <em>man </em>will come after me, let him deny himself, and <strong>take up his cross daily </strong>, and follow me.</p>
