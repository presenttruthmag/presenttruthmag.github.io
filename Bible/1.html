      </blockquote>      
      <p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now let's look at the New Testament</font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The young man whom our Lord raised from the dead was not called back to this world&nbsp;from a conscious spirit existence in heaven.&nbsp; If this young man had died and gone to the glory of heaven why would it be a blessing to come back to life in this sin-darkened old world?? The fact is that&nbsp;he was raised from the sleep of death, not from a glorious existence in heaven as a &quot;spirit&quot; : </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Luke 7:12-15&nbsp; &quot;Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead&nbsp;man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, 'Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.'&nbsp; And he that was&nbsp;dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.&quot; </font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a similar account, t</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">he young maiden in the gospels who was asleep in death was not called back from a spirit existence in heaven to once again live on this earth.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was the &quot;breath of life&quot; which returned to&nbsp;her body, not a conscious immortal &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;ghost&quot;. &nbsp;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While those ignorant of the hope&nbsp;of the&nbsp;resurrection stood about mourning her death, our Lord went to&nbsp;her dead body and took&nbsp;her by the hand and awakened her from&nbsp;her sleep to live again.&nbsp; For the believer, death is merely a sleep from which our Lord shall awaken us: </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Luke 8:52&nbsp; And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth.&nbsp; 53&nbsp; And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. 54&nbsp; But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maiden, arise.&nbsp; 55&nbsp; And her  spirit (<em>pneuma</em> - breath) returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that something be given her to eat.&nbsp; 56&nbsp; And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done. </font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Matthew 9:18-19, 23-26&nbsp; &quot;While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, 'My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.'&nbsp; And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.&nbsp;And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,&nbsp; He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not&nbsp;dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.&nbsp; But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.&nbsp; And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.&quot; </font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Now let's look at how Paul viewed death.</strong>&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When did he teach that believers shall become immortal? At the moment of death? or at the moment of the second coming of Christ on the Last Day? Notice his counsel to the Corinthian church and how he views death, immortality, and the resurrection on the Last Day.&nbsp; There is not even a hint that Paul looked to go to heaven as a bodiless &quot;spirit&quot;.&nbsp; Paul's hope is for the resurrection at the Last Day as the reward of the believer in Christ!! </font></p>      
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Thessalonians 4:13  But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are <strong>asleep</strong>, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.&nbsp; 14&nbsp; For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which <strong>sleep</strong> in Jesus will God bring with him.&nbsp; 15 For this we say unto you by the word&nbsp;of&nbsp;the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming&nbsp;of&nbsp;the Lord shall not prevent (precede) them which are <strong>asleep</strong>. 16&nbsp; For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice&nbsp;of&nbsp;the archangel, and with the trump&nbsp;of&nbsp;God: and the <strong>dead</strong> in Christ shall <strong>rise</strong> first: 17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them (the&nbsp;resurrected believers)&nbsp;in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Corinthian 15:12&nbsp; Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no&nbsp;<strong>resurrection</strong>&nbsp;of the dead?&nbsp; 13 But if there be no&nbsp;<strong>resurrection</strong>&nbsp;of the dead, then is Christ not risen: 14 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. 15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead <strong>rise</strong> not. 16 For if the dead <strong>rise</strong> not, then is not Christ <strong>raised</strong>: 17 And if Christ be not <strong>raised</strong>, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. 18 Then they also which are <strong>fallen asleep</strong> in Christ are perished....  </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19&nbsp; If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.&nbsp; 20&nbsp; But now is Christ <strong>risen</strong> from the dead, and become the <strong>firstfruits of them that slept</strong>.  21 For since by man came <strong>death</strong>, by man came also the&nbsp;<strong>resurrection&nbsp; of the dead.</strong> 22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ <strong>shall</strong> <strong>all be made alive</strong>.&nbsp; 23 But every man in his own order: <strong>Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's</strong> <strong>at his coming</strong>.&nbsp; 24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.&nbsp; 25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. 26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is <strong>death</strong>. 27 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.&nbsp; 28&nbsp; And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. 29 Else what shall they do which are baptized for (Greek:<em>huper</em> &#8212; concerning, dealing with, referring to) the dead, if the <strong>dead rise </strong>not at all? why are they then baptized for (Greek:<em>huper</em> &#8212; concerning, dealing with, referring to)&nbsp;the dead?&nbsp; </font></p>
        </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In verse 29, Paul is saying that those baptized Christians who have died in the faith would have no hope if the dead rise not.&nbsp; Their hope is in the resurrection, not in a conscious &quot;spirit&quot; existence apart from the body!!! </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">30&nbsp; And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?&nbsp; 31&nbsp; I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.&nbsp; 32&nbsp; If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me,<strong> if the dead rise not</strong>? let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die. 33&nbsp; Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.&nbsp; 34&nbsp; Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.&nbsp; 35&nbsp; But some man will say, How are <strong>the dead raised up</strong>? and with what <strong>body</strong> do they come?&nbsp; 36&nbsp; Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened (made alive), except it die:&nbsp; 37&nbsp; And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:&nbsp; 38&nbsp; But God giveth it <strong>a body </strong>as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.&nbsp; 39&nbsp; All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.&nbsp; 40&nbsp; There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.&nbsp; 41&nbsp; There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.&nbsp; 42&nbsp; So also is the <strong>resurrection of the dead</strong>. It <em>(the body: see verse 35)</em> is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:&nbsp; 43&nbsp; It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:&nbsp; 44&nbsp; It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.&nbsp; 45&nbsp; And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening <em>(life-giving)</em>&nbsp;spirit.&nbsp; 46&nbsp; Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.&nbsp; 47&nbsp; The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.&nbsp; 48&nbsp; As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.&nbsp; 49&nbsp; And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly 50&nbsp; Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.&nbsp; </font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When does the Christian receive the glorified spiritual body? At the resurrection!!&nbsp; Notice that Paul does not say that we will be &quot;spirits&quot; in heaven.&nbsp; He says that we will have a <em>spiritual</em> or <em>heavenly</em> body just as our Lord had a glorified heavenly body after his ascension into heaven to sit on His Father's throne.&nbsp; Paul is NOT even suggesting that we will be merely spirits. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even a child can see that Paul is not looking for some disembodied &quot;spirit existence&quot; after death apart from a physical body.&nbsp; He is looking and earnestly longing to be &quot;clothed&quot; with his immortal body at the second coming of Christ when Paul would be &quot;present with the Lord&quot;.&nbsp; When Paul states that&nbsp;he is willing rather to be&nbsp;&quot;absent from the body&quot;, he is referring to his earthly tabernacle so that he might be clothed with his &quot;heavenly&quot; house or tabernacle. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are a few more texts to consider regarding how the word of God describes death.&nbsp; </font></p>

      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The use of &quot;<em>gaw-vah</em>&quot; meaning &quot;to breath out&quot;&nbsp;to express death is consistent with the Genesis account of the creation of all living things as having the &quot;breath of life&quot; from God when they are created and given life.&nbsp; Upon death the person gives up this breath of life and &quot;breaths out&quot; his life or as we would say today, &quot;expires&quot;, (from the word &quot;expiration&quot; or &quot;exhale&quot;) </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The writers&nbsp;of the New Testament also used the Greek word, &quot;<em>ekpsucho</em>&quot; to convey the phrase &quot;give up the ghost&quot; as a synonym of &quot;<em>exepneo</em>&quot;.&nbsp; A direct translation into English could be &quot;He so cried out, and His life&nbsp;(<em>psucho</em>)&nbsp;expired&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Self&quot; or &quot;life&quot; (<em>psucho</em>)  here used as one's life, person, or being.&nbsp; So it is clear that the phrase &quot;gave up the ghost&quot; did not imply that the person&nbsp;left his&nbsp;body as an immortal spirit able to live on&nbsp;without the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;James clearly tells us this in his epistle </font></p>
