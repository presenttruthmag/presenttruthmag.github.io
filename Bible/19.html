<br>

<font face="Arial" size="3">Regarding the Day of Atonement and the Judgment, I think it is very clear that the New Testament writers say that the Christian era was the commencement of the &quot;Day of Atonement&quot; and the &quot;Hour of His judgment has come&quot;. Christ began His reign as king of kings and received His kingdom at His ascension not in 1844 as some groups teach. He must reign in heaven &quot;until all His enemies&quot; are made His footstool when the Kingdom of Babylon is taken out of the way at the end of the &quot;3 and 1/2 years&quot; of desecration of the &quot;Temple&quot;. We as Protestants are to &quot;restore&quot; the judgment hour message. Daniel teaches us that the Temple will be &quot;restored&quot; at the end of the &quot;time&quot;. We must remember that Paul and the other apostles had the &quot;full&quot; gospel not just a part of it. We can only restore what they proclaimed but not add to it.<br>

<br>
Regarding the scapegoat, if we look into the origin of the name Azazel we can shed light on the symbolism of this goat. There has been some excellent scholarship on the significance of the scapegoat.   I believe that Revelation 20 is a figurative representation of Satan being lead into the wilderness or &quot;pit&quot; for 1000 years referring back to the scapegoat symbolism.<br>

<br>
I would like to finish with an appeal for all involved with this line of discussion to remember we are dealing with symbolism in these matters. The reality is that Jesus Christ our Lord has provided all we need for eternal life when He died for our sins on the cross that our sins may be forgiven. Truly our sins are forgiven &quot;in Christ&quot; and they remain forgiven so long as we remain &quot;in Christ&quot; unto the end. We all seek victory over our besetting sins but we are not sinless but are reckoned sinless &quot;in Him&quot;.<br>

<br>
Getting every last detail of prophecy and sanctuary symbolism correct is not a matter of eternal significance and ought not cause one to turn away from the gospel because a few minor details are unclear as to fulfillment. Let us not strain at gnats and end up swallowing a camel by rejecting the message of Christ. I sat on the sidelines of the gospel for 10 years thinking that because there were too many fuzzy areas of minor theology, I could walk away from it. Well I went from denomination to denomination and found that sometimes one needs to walk out in the desert for a while before one appreciates the blessings of an oasis no matter how feeble that oasis may seem. Better to light a small candle than to curse the darkness. Also it is better to put on a ragged and tattered coat than to freeze in the winter blizzard. It is a cold barren world when we think God is not in this gospel movement. So many of my once godly friends who found fault with the gospel message, gave up the distinctive truths of Protestantism and went out to &quot;greener&quot; pastures are now not even Christians. They want nothing to do with the Bible and Christ and are in total darkness.<br>

<br>
Even if we cannot find a nice big green field of green pasture that answers all of our questions about the Bible, a little pasture that is a bit sparse here and there is better than the illusion that lies beyond the fence of God's Law! God is still feeding the sheep of His flock with the oil of His Holy Spirit and is leading us a step at a time into green pastures for His names sake. God is judging the world and all who claim the name of Jesus by revealing new testing truth which will bring about a great divide between those who follow the true Shepherd and those who know Him not. That is why the last days are called the hour of God's judgment. The Law and the Gospel will go hand in hand in this testing time. The Law wounds us and then the Gospel heals us. They must be distinguished but NEVER separated.<br>
