  <strong><font face="Arial" size="3">William Diehl</font></strong></p>
      <p> <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Email response to an email from a&nbsp;Roman Catholic Priest, C. W. : </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">The Christian faith has ceremonies that our Lord instituted for His 
      
followers to observe, e.g., baptism and the Lord's Supper. This is 
      
not what is referred to by "ceremonialism". Ceremonialism or 
      
Sacramentalism means to ascribe saving merit to a ceremony. <br>
      <br>
      Transubstantiation is an example 
      
of sacramentalism. Baptismal regeneration wherein the actual rite 
      
of baptism removes the guilt of original sin is an example of 
      
sacramentalism. To the early church and to the evangelical 
      
Christian church of today the ceremonies of the Lord's Supper and 
      
baptism are NOT saving rites in and of themselves but rather <em>symbols</em> that our Lord gave to the church to teach truth and 
      
proclaim the gospel of justification of repentant sinners by the unmerited grace of God 
      
only through faith  in the sinless life and atoning death of our 
      
Lord upon the cross of Calvary. The Lord's Supper for the early 
      
church was NOT a "re-sacrificing" of Christ and did not involve 
      
the transubstantiation of the bread and wine into the actual body 
      
and blood of Christ. <BR>
      <BR>
      To believe that the early Christian 
      
church taught the same doctrines that the Roman Catholic church 
      
teaches today is a total fabrication and a deception. The Apostles 
      
were NOT Roman Catholics in their doctrine. The Roman Catholic 
      
teaching of Purgatory, intercession of the Saints, the 
      
intercession and assumption of Mary as the "mother of God", Holy 
      
Days, sacramentalism, the doctrinal infallibility of the "pope" 
      
when speaking "ex-cathedra", celibacy of the "clergy", confession 
      
of sin to a "priest", prayers for the dead, the "Mass", the saying 
      
of the "Rosary", chanting, lighting of candles, and justification 
      
by infused grace through the partaking of the "seven sacraments" 
      
are abominations that were brought into the belief system of 
      
Romanism from the pagan&nbsp;teachings of the Babylonian cult of 
      
Nimrod and Semaramis worship. Roman Catholicism is the Mystery of 
      
Iniquity and the "falling away" that Paul warned the early 
      
believers would take place after his departing. It is the 
      
"lamb-like" false prophet of Revelation 13 which sits in the 
      
"Temple of God" and claims to speak for God while in fact the 
      
Roman Catholic church teaches salvation by works of inward 
      
holiness in the believers. It is a total fabrication to state that 
      
Roman Catholicism is the true Christian faith which the apostles 
      
established. The apostles taught justification by faith in the 
      
<em>imputed</em> righteousness of Christ which bears fruit in the life of 
      
the believer of growth in the fruits of the Holy Spirit and growth 
      
in sanctified obedience to the spirit and letter of the Ten 
      
Commandments of God. <br>
      <br>
      The fact is that the sacramental "traditions" of Roman Catholicism do NOT come from the teachings 
      
of the apostles of the first century but rather from the apostate 
      
pseudo-Christians who came into the Church and caused a falling 
      
away from the true teachings of the gospel. These pagan influences 
      
mostly came in through the incorporation of Ebionite, Gnostic and Mithraic 
      
mystery religion traditions while the true doctrines of the early 
      
church were pushed aside. <BR>
      <BR>
      There are NO good works done 
      
with or without the aide of the Holy Spirit which can save you 
      
because all of our good works (even those works motivated by the 
      
Holy Spirit) are never good enough to save you from the demands of 
      
God for holiness. All our good works are filthy rags and unable to 
      
save us from the wrath and justice of God. Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is 
      
the <em>only</em> Righteous One who answered all the demands of the Law of God 
      
for us for righteousness and perfection!! If you will believe and 
      
trust in Him alone without all of the religious works and 
      
sacraments and prayers of the "Saints", God will save you from 
      
your sins right NOW. You can have the full assurance and CERTAINTY 
      
that your sins are completely forgiven and that you have eternal 
      
life in Christ Jesus and for His sake!! <BR>
      <BR>
      Perfectionism is 
      
the focus of the Roman Catholic system of salvation. No believer 
      
can enter heaven directly without his "soul" suffering in 
      
Purgatory to purge away his "venial sins" which were not overcome 
      
during his lifetime. Catholicism teaches that only the "Saints" who have reached perfection 
      
of holiness can enter heaven without passing through Purgatory. 
      
This blasphemous teaching denies the Apostolic gospel fact that a 
      
sinner who repents of his sins and puts his faith in the sinless 
      
life and atoning death of our Lord upon the cross of Calvary is 
      
FULLY pardoned and granted ETERNAL LIFE now and has FULL assurance 
      
that Christ has borne the FULL punishment for all of his sins and 
      
that he has eternal life in Christ. This is not as you claim in your email, "A FRIVOLOUS 
      
PRESUMPTION OF SALVATION". This is the apostolic gospel of Jesus 
      
Christ that all who are trusting in His shed blood have eternal 
      
life and have passed from death unto life through Christ. This is 
      
NOT "sin" as you term it. This is the glorious truth that those 
      
who have Christ have life and peace with God and rejoice in the 
      
coming of the Lord. <BR>
      <BR>
      All the practice of the "Seven 
      
Sacraments" through your "priests" will never give you peace with 
      
God and the full assurance of eternal life in heaven. You can 
      
never be sure that you have done enough "penance" to avoid the 
      
sufferings of Purgatory or Hell. <BR>
      <BR>
      I urge you to come out of 
      
this false system of useless sacramental works religion into the 
      
glorious assurance that the death of Christ on the cross has paid 
      
in full for all of your sins and that you can have peace with God, 
      
because Christ's perfect sinless life is accounted to you and 
      
imputed to you for justification at the judgment bar of God. All 
      
have sinned and all continually fall short of the glory of God but 
      
being justified by faith we have peace with God through Jesus 
      
Christ our Lord through whom we NOW have received the atonement 
      
for our sins. Praise the Lord we are free in Christ. </font></font></p>

              Bill, I was following you right up until the end 
    
when you said growth in sanctified obedience to the spirit and "letter of the Ten Commandments" of God. You won't find anywhere 
    
in the apostles teaching a reference to obedience to the LETTER of 
    
the LAW (that is unless you are attempting to be sanctified by the 
    
Law!) <BR>
    <BR>
    Rom 2:29 -- But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and 
    
circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, NOT BY 
    
THE LETTER; and his praise is not from men, but from God. <BR>
    <BR>
    Rom 7:6 -- But now we have been released from the Law, 
    
having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in 
    
newness of the Spirit and NOT IN THE OLDNESS OF THE LETTER. <BR>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
        <font size="3">To J. <BR>
        We must be very careful how we 
  
interpret Paul's use of the term "letter" in these verses: </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read 
        
of all men: Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the 
        
epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with 
        
the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in 
        
fleshy tables of the heart. And such trust have we through Christ 
        
to God-ward: Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any 
        
thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; Who also 
        
hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the 
        
LETTER, but of the spirit: for the LETTER killeth, but the spirit 
        
giveth life. But if the ministration of death, written and 
        
engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel 
        
could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of 
        
his countenance; which glory was to be done away: How shall not 
        
the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? For if the 
        
ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the 
        
ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which 
        
was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the 
        
glory that excelleth. For if that which is done away was glorious, 
        
much more that which remaineth is glorious." <BR>
        <BR>
"Wherefore, 
        
my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of 
        
Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is 
        
raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. 
        
For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by 
        
the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. 
        
But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we 
        
were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in 
        
the oldness of the LETTER. What shall we say then? Is the law sin? 
        
God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had 
        
not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But 
        
sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner 
        
of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. For I was 
        
alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin 
        
revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to 
        
life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the 
        
commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. Wherefore the law is 
        
holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that 
        
which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it 
        
might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that 
        
sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. For we know 
        
that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. For 
        
that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but 
        
what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I would not, I 
        
consent unto the law that it is good." <BR>
        <BR>
"And shall not 
        
uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge 
        
thee, who by the LETTER and circumcision dost transgress the law? 
        
For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that 
        
circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: But he is a Jew, 
        
which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in 
        
the spirit, and not in the LETTER; whose praise is not of men, but 
        
of God." </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">The apostle Paul recognized two ways to be 
    
justified before God. <BR>
    <BR>
    1.) By one's perfect obedience to 
    
the letter of the Ten Commandments. This is the covenant of "obey 
    
and LIVE", the ministry of death. For by the doing of the Law no 
    
flesh can be justified in His sight. <BR>
    <BR>
    2.) By repentance towards God and faith (see Acts 20:21) in the perfect sinless life and atoning death of 
    
our Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary. This is the New 
    
Covenant that declares, "He who is justified by faith (in Christ) 
    
will LIVE". <BR>
    <BR>
    The children of Israel at Mt. Sinai after the 
    
giving and reading of the Law pledged that "all that Thou hast 
    
said we will do". God replied that they had answered well but oh 
    
that there were a heart in them to obey. This covenant of 
    
justification by obedience to the "letter" of the Law is what Paul 
    
refers to as the ministration (covenant) of death. It is with this 
    
in mind that Paul states that the true Jew is not the person who 
    
only obeys the "letter" outwardly but who is one who is of the 
    
"Spirit", that is, he who is justified by faith in Christ's 
    
<em>imputed</em> righteousness has the true "circumcision" of the heart. 
    
His "praise" (acceptance, justification) is not of men through 
    
mere outward obedience to the "letter" of the Law but through the 
    
"praise" that is of God by being justified by faith. Thus  Paul is saying that 
    
to seek to be justified by one's conformity to the Ten 
    
Commandments is to come "under the Law" and to enter into a 
    
ministration of death. This "ministration" leads only to 
    
"condemnation" but the ministration of the new covenant leads to 
    
"praise" and eternal life. <BR>
    <BR>
    Thus Paul could say, "Not that 
    
we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; 
    
but our sufficiency is of God;" That is to say, the righteousness 
    
("sufficiency") by which we are righteous before God is "not of 
    
ourselves" (not in us) but rather the righteousness 
    
("sufficiency") by which we are righteous before God is found only 
    
in the person of Jesus Christ and is imputed unto us by faith. <BR>
    <BR>
    We who are married to Christ by faith in His sinless life 
    
and atoning death on the cross are to consider ourselves "divorced" from the &quot;old 
    
husband&quot;, the carnal nature with its desire to be justified by our 
    
works. It is false religion, the religion of the flesh, which follows the "covenant of works&quot; which is seeking to be justified by 
    
the "letter" of the Law. We are of the "Spirit" in that we are 
    
justified by faith in Christ's perfect "doing" (sinless obedience) to the 
    
Law of God for us and His &quot;dying&quot; (propitiatory death) upon the cross of Calvary to put away 
    
and blot out the "hand-writing of the ordinances that was against 
    
us" by blotting out our sins and our shameful record of misdeeds (Greek:<em>chirographon- </em>a legal indictment of crimes or document of indebtedness ). <BR>
    <BR>
    So in summary Paul uses the term "letter" of the Law to 
    
refer to the old covenant of "obey (the letter) and live". <BR>
    <BR>
    Paul clearly saw "Three Uses" for the Law which the 
    
Protestant Reformers termed the First, Second, and Third Uses of 
    
the Law. In our discussion here we will discuss only the <em>second</em> and <em>third</em> use of the Law. We will ignore the &quot;first use&quot; of the Law for now. <BR>
    <BR>
    In Romans 2 Paul is using the Law in its <em>Second 
    
Use</em>, namely <em>to convict of sin</em>. </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"For we know that the law is 
        
spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin." and "I had not known 
        
sin, but by the Law: for I had not known lust, except the law had 
        
said, Thou shalt not covet." </font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">It is not until Romans 8 and Romans 13
      
where Paul uses the Law in its <em>Third Use</em>, that is, as <em>a moral 
      
guide for the repentant believer in Christ</em>. We must not make the 
      
mistake that because Paul uses the term "letter of the Law" to 
      
describe the old covenant of "Obey and Live", he is inferring that 
      
there is no longer a written law for us to follow as a guide in 
      
our Christian life. Paul himself frequently quotes from the Ten 
      
Commandments as he urges the believers to sanctified living and 
      
good works. Thus Paul could say: </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Owe no man any thing, 
        
but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled 
        
the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not 
        
kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, 
        
Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is 
        
briefly comprehended (summarized) in this saying, namely, Thou 
        
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his 
        
neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law." 
        
    </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">And also Paul could say, </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"But as God hath distributed to 
        
every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And 
        
so ordain I in all churches. Is any man called being circumcised? 
        
let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? 
        
let him not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and 
        
uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of 
        
God." </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">And also Paul could say, </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Children, obey your 
        
parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour thy father and 
        
mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) That it may 
        
be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth." 
        
</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">And John the apostle, applying the Third Use of the Law 
      
could say, </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth 
        
himself, even as he is pure. Whosoever committeth sin 
        
transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the 
        
law. And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and 
        
in him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever 
        
sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. Little children, let 
        
no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even 
        
as he is righteous. He that committeth sin is of the devil." 
        
    </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">And there is the testimony of James the brother of Christ 
      
who makes strong application of the Third Use of the Law:</font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, 
        
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: But if ye 
        
have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the 
        
law as transgressors. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and 
        
yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do 
        
not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no 
        
adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the 
        
law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the 
        
law of liberty. For he shall have judgment without mercy, that 
        
hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment."</font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">And finally our Lord Jesus Christ Himself frequently 
    
applied the Law in its Tertiary use: </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Let your light so 
        
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify 
        
your Father which is in heaven. Think not that I am come to 
        
destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to 
        
fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one 
        
jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be 
        
fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least 
        
commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least 
        
in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, 
        
the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I say 
        
unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the 
        
righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case 
        
enter into the kingdom of heaven. Ye have heard that it was said 
        
by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill 
        
shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say unto you......."

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">So in summary, Jodi, Paul's use of the term "letter of the 
      
Law" is in the context of the old covenant in seeking to be 
      
righteous (justified) before God by obeying the Law. This is the 
      
works covenant that Israel and later the Pharisees in Christ's day and later still the Ebionites in the apostolic era who ignorantly sought to make with God. They sought 
      
to obey the "letter" of the Law to be justified by saying that 
      
they would &quot;obey and live&quot;. <BR>
      <BR>
      If only they had rather 
      
responded as did Isaiah did by saying "Woe is me !! For I am 
      
undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the 
      
midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the 
      
King, the LORD of hosts. Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, 
      
having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs 
      
from off the altar: And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, 
      
this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and 
      
thy sin purged." Then like Issaiah, they would have been JUSTIFIED 
      
by FAITH. Even as our Lord said of the poor Publican who stood 
      
afar off in the temple and who would not even look up to heaven 
      
but smote his breast and said, "Lord be merciful unto me a 
      
sinner." He went down unto his house JUSTIFIED. This is what it is 
      
to be of the "Spirit" and NOT of the "letter". <BR>

          As David the psalmist said, </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the 
                
ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the 
                
seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the LORD 
                
and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be 
                
like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth 
                
his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and 
                
whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. The ungodly are not so but are 
                
like the chaff which the wind driveth away. Therefore the ungodly 
                
shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation 
                
of the righteous. For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: 
                
but the way of the ungodly shall perish." Psalm 1:1ff </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">The 
              
blood of our Lord Jesus Christ does not cover willful high-handed 
              
disregard for the Law of God. There is not a single Protestant 
              
Reformer who taught that the Ten Commandments as a moral guide 
              
were done away with. <BR>
              <BR>
              The various Protestant denominations have very serious eschatological and 
              
soteriological problems which need to be faced. There 
              
is great danger that many who see the many doctrinal faults within 
              
the Reformation groups will discard the Third Use of the Law simply because 
              
some do not understand the Second Use of God's holy Law. It 
              
may be that our Lord will ultimately pass by the present Protestant denominations as part of the movement to restore all that Antichrist has cast 
              
down, but however He moves in the future, the restoration of ALL 
              
of God's commandments will be part of that restoration. The fourth 
              
commandment deals a death blow to the humanist evolutionists who 
              
deny God's creation of the universe in six literal days and His 
              
resting on the seventh day. There is no doubt that the Lord's Day 
              
even as quoted by the Didache is the seventh day of the week. The "preparation day", also mentioned in the Didache, has always been 
              
the sixth day of the week in preparation of the Sabbath rest of 
              
the fourth commandment.<b><strong><BR>
              </strong></b><BR>
              God will have a people who rest 
              
WITH Christ and IN Christ on the seventh day of the week. Will the Holy Spirit  desert those who refuse to acknowledge 
              
Him as the Creator of the world in six literal days and rest upon 
              
the seventh day as His fourth commandment calls us to REMEMBER? 
              
Absolutely. There is no salvation for a &quot;legalist&quot; and at the same 
              
time and on the other hand, there is no salvation for those who 
              
willfully disregard any of the commandments of God's holy Law. 
              
Both groups, religious legalists and humanistic antinomians, even though they hate each other, will unite to 
              
crucify our Lord afresh in the final hours of earth's history. 
              
Both groups will unite to oppose the final gospel restoration 
              
message of God which will go to all the world. <BR>
              <BR>
              God bless 
              
you,<BR>
