        <br>
            I'd just like to add to what Bill D. (PTRUTH) said about Roman Titles and blasphemy. I find it very offensive for someone to refer himself as REVEREND. Scripture tells us in Psa 111:9 &quot;He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.&quot;<br>

<br>
      </strong><font size="3">This reply is to mpizar (MMichael) referring to his comment about those who use the title of Reverend.. While I cannot argue (nor would I attempt to) that scripture does say that His name is reverend, an attentive perusal of this passage (from Psa. 111:9) would immediately indicate that this passage does not preclude anyone from using this as a title, particularly since this is not referred to as His title. The Hebrew/Chaldee word for reverend here is &quot;yare&quot; and it takes on the form of an adjective giving us to know that this refers to an attribute and not a title or name (which incidentally would have to take on the form of a noun). Therefore, this scripture is saying that his name has the attribute of being &quot;holy&quot; and &quot;reverend&quot; bringing to man the responsibility of holding His name in high regard, respect, and fear. To deduce from this scripture that no one should be called <em>reverend</em> totally removes this passage from it's scriptural context and thereby eradicates its original purpose and meaning. So, to properly divide the word of truth and to put precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little and there a little (Isa. 28:10) we cannot ignore the word &quot;holy&quot; in this passage. On many occasions scripture has indicated that God's people would be CALLED holy (Isa. 4:3; 62:12; Luke 2:23; 1 Peter 1:15, 16), so now it stands to reason that since both holy and reverend are grouped together in Psa. 111:9 that if, we can be referred to as <em>holy</em>, we can also be referred to as <em>reverend</em>. We are called &quot;holy&quot; because of who we represent (along with a representative lifestyle) therefore I, as a man of God, think it not robbery to be called &quot;reverend&quot; because of who I represent.    Reverend D.</font><strong><br>

  I must admit that &quot;Reverend&quot; Duncan's post gave me a real chuckle. The church of Christ is &quot;holy&quot; only by faith in the sinless life and atoning death of Christ on the cross of Calvary. As Luther so aptly put it to all outward appearance the Church is really a rather sorry lot of beggars at the table of the Lord who in fact are not even worthy of the crumbs from His table but yet He sets us at a glorious table full of delicacies in the presence of our enemies &quot;for His name's sake&quot;. 1 Sam 2:8 &quot;He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them. 9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.&quot; I can just see it now: those who knew me from the past and even those who know me now that I am a professing Christian walk up to me and address me as &quot;Reverend Bill&quot;. Ha! I would be laughed out of church and I would be laughing with them. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">No, brother Duncan, we are all brethren in Christ and our &quot;holiness&quot; is by faith in the blood of Christ. It is the very spirit of AntiChrist that constructs a hierarchy of power and title and respecters of persons of men. The Protestant Reformation is moving forward and cutting off all the vestiges of the &quot;Mystery&quot; religions with the &quot;degrees&quot; of &quot;knowledge&quot;. We proclaim the priesthood of all believers. We have One who is reverend and holy and good even our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He alone is worthy of honor for He alone is worthy to take the scroll and open the seals thereof. Those who misuse the word of God to build up what the Lord has torn down will have their lot with the hypocrites and unbelievers. The Lord is cleansing the Temple of the abominations of the Man of Sin. &quot;So then brethren, we are not children of the 'bond woman' but of the 'free'. Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage....For we through the Spirit eagerly WAIT for the hope of righteousness by faith. Praise His holy and reverend name! We are holy and reverend by grace alone through faith in His holiness alone imputed and reckoned to repentant sinners. Praise His reverend name, Babylon has fallen!! Come out of her my people!!</font></font></p>

<br>
While I do not agree with your views here, basically I have refrained from posting a rebuttal to the &quot;reverend&quot; title issue for several reasons. 1.) I do not believe in debating the Word of God as I believe the Word is not to be debated, but learned, believed and lived. (Besides, debate is not the way to witness anyway.) 2.) I respect your right to disagree with me. 3.) I have to remind myself that I'm the &quot;outsider&quot; on this forum. However, there was something you stated in your post that puzzles me please explain. You stated... &quot;The church of Christ is &quot;holy&quot; by faith alone.&quot; My response... Please provide me with some scriptural basis for this statement. As I understand scripture, we are commanded to be holy as God is holy. I happen to be a holiness preacher in that I preach the necessity of living a life of holiness and that we as the body of Christ are called his holy people. Needless-to-say, this statement really disturbed me. Again, please provide SCRIPTURAL basis for this statement. I could take issue with several things you stated, but the love of Christ is constraining me from doing so, but I will state that I totally agree with your last statement about walking in liberty and I pray that you really come to realize and experience the true liberty in Christ Jesus as many of your statements illustrate bondage of mind, thought and experience. God Bless You My Brother and I Indeed Love You With The Love Of The Lord...! </font><b><strong><br>

</strong></b><font size="3">Dear sir,<br>

<br>
You certainly sound like you are holy to me! I am just a dog who really is not worthy of the crumbs from my Lord's table. I have never lived a single day, hour, or minute wherein I could say that I am holy and reverend. All my works fall short of the glory of God and I admit that I do not repent of my ungodliness as I ought, I do not love God as I ought, I do not love my fellow man as I ought, I am selfish, proud, think evil of others, my heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, I gossip when I should not, I lose my temper when I drive in traffic, I am untrustworthy, unforgiving, I love the praise of men, I overeat and under exercise, my yard is messy at times, I look at pretty women out of the corner of my eye, and there are some people I know that I would love to punch in the mouth. Other than all this I guess that I am a &quot;good&quot; guy! But thanks be to God who justifies the ungodly who put their faith in the perfect righteousness of my Lord Jesus Christ who lived a perfect, sinless, holy life and died on the  cross for the likes of a bum like me. Oh, I just thought of a good thing I do. I don't smoke cigarettes any more but I must admit I like the smell of a good cigar. Woe is me for I am undone. O wretched Man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. In Him I am more than a conqueror through Him who loved me and gave Himself for me. I am being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God set forth as a propitiation by faith in His blood. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes righteousness apart from works. Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall not impute sin. I doubt if you would like me very much if you really knew me like Jesus knows me. He knows me as I truly am and yet He loves me any way. Thanks for the offer of friendship though, &quot;Reverend&quot; Duncan. Bill D.</font><b><strong><br>
