    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Phil 2:6</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God,<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Col 1:15-19</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.<br>

16 For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.<br>

17 And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.<br>

18 And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence.<br>

19 For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell,<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Heb 1:1-3, 6-12</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,

2 has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds;<br>

3 who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,<br>
6 But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: &quot;Let all the angels of God worship Him.&quot;<br>
7 And of the angels He says: &quot;Who makes His angels spirits And His ministers a flame of fire.&quot;<br>
8 But to the Son He says: &quot;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your Kingdom.<br>
9 You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.&quot;<br>
10 And: &quot;You, LORD, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands.<br>

11 They will perish, but You remain; And they will all grow old like a garment;<br>
12 Like a cloak You will fold them up, And they will be changed. But You are the same, And Your years will not fail.&quot;<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 5:18,21,23,26</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God.<br>
  21 &quot;For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom He will.<br>
  23 &quot;that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.<br>
  26 &quot;For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself,<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 8:57-58</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">57 Then the Jews said to Him, &quot;You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?&quot;<br>
  58 Jesus said to them, &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.&quot;</font><br>
