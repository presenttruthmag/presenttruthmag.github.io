  <p><i>Ex. 20:3-17</i>  
  <p>3 &quot; You shall have no other gods before Me.   
  <p>4 &quot; You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness [of] [anything] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth; 5 you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth [generations] of those who hate Me, 6 but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.   
  <p>7 &quot; You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold [him] guiltless who takes His name in vain.   
  <p>8 &quot; Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day [is] the Sabbath of the Lord your God. [In] [it] you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who [is] within your gates. 11 For [in] six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that [is] in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.   
  <p>12 &quot; Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you.   
  <p>13 &quot; You shall not murder.   
  <p>14 &quot; You shall not commit adultery.   
  <p>15 &quot; You shall not steal.   
  <p>16 &quot; You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.   
  <p>17 &quot; You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that [is] your neighbor's.&quot;<br>

  <p><i>Matt. 5:17-48</i>  
  <p>17 &quot; Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. 18 &quot;For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. 19 &quot;Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches [them], he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 &quot;For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds [the] [righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. 21 &quot; You have heard that it was said to those of old, `You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.' 22 &quot;But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, `Raca!' shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, `You fool!' shall be in danger of hell fire. 23 &quot;Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, 24 &quot;leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. 25 &quot;Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. 26 &quot;Assuredly, I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny. 27 &quot; You have heard that it was said to those of old, `You shall not commit adultery.' 28 &quot;But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 &quot;If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast [it] from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell. 30 &quot;And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast [it] from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell. 31 &quot; Furthermore it has been said, `Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.' 32 &quot;But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery. 33 &quot; Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, `You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.' 34 &quot;But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; 35 &quot;nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 &quot;Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. 37 &quot;But let your `Yes' be `Yes,' and your `No,' `No.' For whatever is more than these is from the evil one. 38 &quot; You have heard that it was said, `An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'39 &quot;But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. 40 &quot;If anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him have [your] cloak also. 41 &quot;And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. 42 &quot;Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away. 43 &quot; You have heard that it was said, `You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' 44 &quot;But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, 45 &quot;that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 46 &quot;For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 47 &quot;And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more [than] [others]? Do not even the tax collectors do so? 48 &quot;Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.<br>

  <p><i>Matt. 15:3-9</i>  
  <p>3 He answered and said to them, &quot;Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 4 &quot;For God commanded, saying, `Honor your father and your mother'; and, `He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.' 5 &quot;But you say, `Whoever says to his father or mother, &quot;Whatever profit you might have received from me [is] a gift [to] [God]&quot;-- 6 `then he need not honor his father or mother.' Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. 7 &quot;Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: 8 `These people draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with [their] lips, But their heart is far from Me. 9 And in vain they worship Me, Teaching [as] doctrines the commandments of men.' &quot;<br>

  <p><i>Matt. 22:36-40</i>  
  <p>36 &quot;Teacher, which [is] the great commandment in the law?&quot; 37 Jesus said to him, &quot; `You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.' 38 &quot;This is [the] first and great commandment. 39 &quot;And [the] second [is] like it: `You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' 40 &quot;On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.&quot;<br>

  <p><i>Rom. 13:10</i>  
  <p>10 Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love [is] the fulfillment of the law.<br>

  <p><i>1 Cor. 7:19</i>  
  <p>19 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God [is] [what] [matters].<br>

  <p><i>1 John 2:3-6, 15-17</i>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. 4 He who says, &quot;I know Him,&quot; and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. 6 He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked. . . . .15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that [is] in the world--the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life--is not of the Father but is of the world. 17 And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.<br>
