  <p><i>Luke 11:9-13</i></font>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 &quot; So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
  knock, and it will be opened to you. 10 &quot;For everyone who asks receives, and he who
  seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 11 &quot;If a son asks for bread
  from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if [he] [asks] for a fish, will he
  give him a serpent instead of a fish? 12 &quot;Or if he asks for an egg, will he offer him
  a scorpion? 13 &quot;If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your
  children, how much more will [your] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask
  Him!&quot;<br>
