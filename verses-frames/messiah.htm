<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 But He [was] wounded for our transgressions, [He] [was]
    bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace [was] upon Him, And by His
    stripes we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to
    his own way; And the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. 7 He was oppressed and
    He was afflicted, Yet He opened not His mouth; He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, And
    as a sheep before its shearers is silent, So He opened not His mouth. 8 He was taken from
    prison and from judgment, And who will declare His generation? For He was cut off from the
    land of the living; For the transgressions of My people He was stricken. 9 And they made
    His grave with the wicked-- But with the rich at His death, Because He had done no
    violence, Nor [was] [any] deceit in His mouth. 10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him;
    He has put [Him] to grief. When You make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see [His]
    seed, He shall prolong [His] days, And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.
    11 He shall see the labor of His soul, [and] be satisfied. By His knowledge My righteous
    Servant shall justify many, For He shall bear their iniquities. 12 Therefore I will divide
    Him a portion with the great, And He shall divide the spoil with the strong, Because He
    poured out His soul unto death, And He was numbered with the transgressors, And He bore
    the sin of many, And made intercession for the transgressors.<br>
