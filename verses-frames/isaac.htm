<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year
    a hundredfold; and the Lord blessed him. . . . 23 Then he went up from there to Beersheba. 24 And the Lord
  appeared to him the same night and said, &quot;I [am] the God of your father Abraham; do
  not fear, for I [am] with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for My
  servant Abraham's sake.&quot; 25 So he built an altar there and called on the name of the
  Lord, and he pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants dug a well.<br>
