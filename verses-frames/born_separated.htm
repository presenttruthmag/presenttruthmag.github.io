    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Col 1:21a</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And you, who once were <strong>alienated</strong> and <strong>enemies</strong> in your mind by wicked works, <br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Eph 4:17-19</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind, 18 having their understanding darkened, being <strong>alienated</strong> from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart; 19 who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lewdness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Jer 17:9</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The heart is <strong>deceitful</strong> above all things, And <strong>desperately wicked</strong>; Who can know it?<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Isaiah 59:2</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But your iniquities have <strong>separated</strong> you from your God; And your sins have hidden His face from you, So that He will not hear.<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Psalms 51:5</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Behold, I was <strong>brought forth in iniquity</strong>, And<strong> in sin my mother conceived me.</strong><br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Psalms 53:2-3</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 God looks down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any who understand, who seek God. 3 Every one of them has turned aside; They have together <strong>become corrupt;</strong> There is none who does good, No, not one.
