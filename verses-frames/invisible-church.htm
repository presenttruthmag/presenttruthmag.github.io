  <p><I>Rev. 12:14</I>  
  <p>14 But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the
  wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from
  the presence of the serpent.<br>
  
  <p><I>John 10:16</I>  
  <p>16 &quot;And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and
    they will hear My voice; and there will be one flock [and] one shepherd.<br>
    
<p><I>Heb. 12:22-24</I>
<p>22 But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly
  Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, 23 to the general assembly and church of
  the firstborn [who] [are] registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of
  just men made perfect, 24 to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of
  sprinkling that speaks better things than [that] [of] Abel.<br>
  
  <p><I>Eph. 5:23-27</I>  
  <p>23 For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is
  the Savior of the body. 24 Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so [let]
  the wives [be] to their own husbands in everything. 25 Husbands, love your wives, just as
  Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, 26 that He might sanctify and
  cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, 27 that He might present her to Himself
  a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be
  holy and without blemish.<br>
  
  <p><I>Luke 10:20</I>  
  <p>20 &quot;Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but
  rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.&quot;<br>
  
  <p><I>Phil. 4:3</I></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 And I urge you also, true companion, help these women who labored with me in the
gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names [are] in the
Book of Life.<br>
