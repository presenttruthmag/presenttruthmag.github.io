  <p><i>Luke 1:26-35</i>  
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to
  a city of Galilee named Nazareth, 27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph,
  of the house of David. The virgin's name [was] Mary. 28 And having come in, the angel said
  to her, &quot;Rejoice, highly favored [one], the Lord [is] with you; blessed [are] you
  among women!&quot; 29 But when she saw [him], she was troubled at his saying, and
  considered what manner of greeting this was. 30 Then the angel said to her, &quot;Do not
  be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 &quot;And behold, you will conceive
  in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name Jesus. 32 &quot;He will be
  great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the
  throne of His father David. 33 &quot;And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever,
  and of His kingdom there will be no end.&quot; 34 Then Mary said to the angel, &quot;How
  can this be, since I do not know a man?&quot; 35 And the angel answered and said to her,
  &quot;[The] Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow
  you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.<br>
