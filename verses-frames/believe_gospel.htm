  <i>Romans 10:9-13</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and<strong> believe</strong> in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one <strong>believes</strong> unto righteousness (justification), and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, "Whoever <strong>believes</strong> on Him will not be put to shame." 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For "whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved."</font>
