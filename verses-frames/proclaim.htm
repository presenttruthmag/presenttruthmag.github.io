  <p><I>1 Cor. 11:26</I>  
  <p>26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death
  till He comes.<br>
  
  <p><I>John 6:52-64</I></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">52 The Jews therefore quarreled among themselves, saying, &quot;How can this [Man] give
us [His] flesh to eat?&quot; 53 Then Jesus said to them, &quot;Most assuredly, I say to
you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in
you. 54 &quot;Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise
him up at the last day. 55 &quot;For My flesh is food indeed, and My blood is drink
indeed. 56 &quot;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him. 57
&quot;As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on
Me will live because of Me. 58 &quot;This is the bread which came down from heaven--not as
your fathers ate the manna, and are dead. He who eats this bread will live forever.&quot;
59 These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum. 60 Therefore many of
His disciples, when they heard [this], said, &quot;This is a hard saying; who can
understand it?&quot; 61 When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples complained about
this, He said to them, &quot;Does this offend you? 62 &quot;[What] then if you should see
the Son of Man ascend where He was before? 63 &quot;It is the Spirit who gives life; the
flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and [they] are life. 64
&quot;But there are some of you who do not believe.&quot; For Jesus knew from the
beginning who they were who did not believe, and who would betray Him.<br>
