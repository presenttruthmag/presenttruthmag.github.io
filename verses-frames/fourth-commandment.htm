<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 &quot; Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do
all your work, 10 but the seventh day [is] the Sabbath of the Lord your God. [In] [it] you
shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your
female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who [is] within your gates. 11 For [in]
six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that [is] in them, and
rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.<br>
