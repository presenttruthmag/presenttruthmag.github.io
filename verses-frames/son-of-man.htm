  <p><i>Dan. 7:13</i>  
  <p>13 &quot;I was watching in the night visions, And behold, [One] like the Son of Man,
      Coming with the clouds of heaven! He came to the Ancient of Days, And they brought Him
      near before Him.<br>
    
<p><i>Matt. 9:6</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 &quot;But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive
  sins&quot;--then He said to the paralytic, &quot;Arise, take up your bed, and go to your
  house.&quot;<br>
