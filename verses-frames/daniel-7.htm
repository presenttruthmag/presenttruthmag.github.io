<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 (NKJV) In the first year of
        
Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head [while] on his bed.
        
Then he wrote down the dream, telling the main facts.  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 Daniel spoke, saying, &quot;I saw
        
in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the Great
        
Sea.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 &quot;And four great beasts came
        
up from the sea, each different from the other.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 &quot;The first [was] like a lion,
        
and had eagle's wings. I watched till its wings were plucked off; and it was lifted up
        
from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a man's heart was given to
        
it.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 &quot;And suddenly another beast,
        
a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and [had] three ribs in its mouth
        
between its teeth. And they said thus to it: `Arise, devour much flesh!'</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 &quot;After this I looked, and
        
there was another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The beast
        
also had four heads, and dominion was given to it.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 &quot;After this I saw in the
        
night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, exceedingly strong. It
        
had huge iron teeth; it was devouring, breaking in pieces, and trampling the residue with
        
its feet. It [was] different from all the beasts that [were] before it, and it had ten
        
horns.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 &quot;I was considering the horns,
        
and there was another horn, a little one, coming up among them, before whom three of the
        
first horns were plucked out by the roots. And there, in this horn, [were] eyes like the
        
eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking pompous words.</font>    
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 &quot;I watched till thrones were
    
put in place, And the Ancient of Days was seated; His garment [was] white as snow, And the hair of His head [was] like
      
pure wool. </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His throne [was] a fiery flame, its wheels a burning fire; </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 A fiery stream issued And came forth from before Him. A thousand thousands ministered to
          
Him; Ten thousand times ten thousand
          
stood before Him. The court was seated, And the books were opened.  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 &quot;I watched then because of
          
the sound of the pompous words which the horn was speaking; I watched till the beast was
          
slain, and its body destroyed and given to the burning flame. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 &quot;As for the rest of the
          
beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season
          
and a time.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 &quot;I was watching in the night
          
visions, And behold, [One] like the Son of
          
Man, Coming with the clouds of heaven! He came to the Ancient of Days, And they brought Him near before
          
Him.  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Then to Him was given dominion
          
and glory and a kingdom, That all peoples, nations, and
          
languages should serve Him. His dominion [is] an everlasting
          
dominion, Which shall not pass away, And His kingdom [the] [one] Which shall not be destroyed.  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 &quot;I,
          
Daniel, was grieved in my spirit within [my] body, and the visions of my head troubled me. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 &quot;I came near to one of those
          
who stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made known to me the
          
interpretation of these things:</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 `Those great beasts, which are
          
four, [are] four kings [which] arise out of the earth.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 `But the saints of the Most High
          
shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.'</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 &quot;Then I wished to know the
          
truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly
          
dreadful, [with] its teeth of iron and its nails of bronze, [which] devoured, broke in
          
pieces, and trampled the residue with its feet;</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 &quot;and the ten horns that
          
[were] on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, before which three fell, namely,
          
that horn which had eyes and a mouth which spoke pompous words, whose appearance [was]
          
greater than his fellows.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 &quot;I was watching; and the
          
same horn was making war against the saints, and prevailing against them,</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 &quot;until the Ancient of Days
          
came, and a judgment was made [in] [favor] of the saints of the Most High, and the time
          
came for the saints to possess the kingdom.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 &quot; Thus
        
he said: `The fourth beast shall beA fourth kingdom on earth,  Which shall be different from all
        
[other] kingdoms,  And shall devour the whole earth, Trample it and break it in pieces. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">24 The ten horns [are] ten kings [Who] shall arise from this kingdom. And another shall rise after them;  He shall be different from the first
        
[ones],  And shall subdue three kings.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 He shall speak [pompous] words
        
against the Most High, Shall persecute the saints of the
        
Most High, And shall intend to change times and
        
law. Then [the] [saints] shall be given
        
into his hand For a time and times and half a
        
time.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 `But
        
the court shall be seated, And they shall take away his
        
dominion, To consume and destroy [it] forever.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">27 Then the kingdom and dominion, And the greatness of the kingdoms
        
under the whole heaven, Shall be given to the people, the
        
saints of the Most High. His kingdom [is] an everlasting
        
kingdom, And all dominions shall serve and
        
obey Him.'</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">28 &quot;This [is] the end of the

account. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly troubled me, and my countenance changed;

but I kept the matter in my heart.&quot; <BR>
