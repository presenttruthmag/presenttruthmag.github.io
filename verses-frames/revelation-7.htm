<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 (NKJV) After these things I saw
      four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the
      earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, on the sea, or on any tree.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 Then I saw another angel ascending
      from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the
      four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 saying, &quot;Do not harm the
      earth, the sea, or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God on their
      foreheads.&quot;   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 And I heard the number of those
      who were sealed. One hundred [and] forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children
      of Israel [were] sealed:   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 of the tribe of Judah twelve
      thousand [were] sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve
      thousand [were] sealed; of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand
      [were] sealed; </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 of the tribe of Asher twelve
    thousand [were] sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali twelve
    thousand [were] sealed; of the tribe of Manasseh twelve
    thousand [were] sealed;   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 of the tribe of Simeon twelve
    thousand [were] sealed; of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand
    [were] sealed; of the tribe of Issachar twelve
    thousand [were] sealed;   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 of the tribe of Zebulun twelve
    thousand [were] sealed; of the tribe of Joseph twelve
    thousand [were] sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin twelve
    thousand [were] sealed.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 After these things I looked, and
    behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and
    tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with
    palm branches in their hands,   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 and crying out with a loud voice,
    saying, &quot;Salvation [belongs] to our God who sits on the throne, and to the
    Lamb!&quot;   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 All the angels stood around the
    throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and fell on their faces before the
throne and worshiped God,   </font>  
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 saying: &quot;Amen! Blessing and glory and
    wisdom,&nbsp; Thanksgiving and honor and power and
might, [Be] to our God forever and ever. Amen.&quot; </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 Then one of the elders answered,
    saying to me, &quot;Who are these arrayed in white robes, and where did they come
    from?&quot;   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 And I said to him, &quot;Sir, you
    know.&quot; So he said to me, &quot;These are the ones who come out of the great
  tribulation, and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 &quot;Therefore they are before
      the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the
  throne will dwell among them. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 &quot;They shall neither hunger
anymore nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor any heat; </font>  
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 &quot;for the Lamb who is in the
midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters. And
God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
