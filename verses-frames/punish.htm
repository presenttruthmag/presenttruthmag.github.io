  <p><i>Luke 12:47-49</i>  
  <p>47 &quot;And that servant who knew his master's will, and did not prepare [himself] or
  do according to his will, shall be beaten with many [stripes]. 48 &quot;But he who did not
  know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For everyone to
  whom much is given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been committed,
  of him they will ask the more. 49 &quot; I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish
  it were already kindled!<br>

  <p><i>2 Pet. 2:9-14</i>  
  <p>9 [then] the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the
  unjust under punishment for the day of judgment, 10 and especially those who walk
  according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. [They] [are]
  presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries, 11 whereas
  angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against
  them before the Lord. 12 But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and
  destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in
  their own corruption, 13 [and] will receive the wages of unrighteousness, [as] those who
  count it pleasure to carouse in the daytime. [They] [are] spots and blemishes, carousing
  in their own deceptions while they feast with you, 14 having eyes full of adultery and
  that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls. [They] [have] a heart trained in
  covetous practices, [and] [are] accursed children.<br>

  <p><i>2 Th. 1:9</i>  
  <p>9 These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord
  and from the glory of His power,<br>

  <p><i>Matt. 25:46</i>  
  <p>46 &quot;And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into
  eternal life.&quot;<br>

  <p><i>Heb. 10:29</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">29 Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has
  trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was
  sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace?<br>
