  <p>1 (NKJV) In the third year of Cyrus
    
king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar. The
    
message [was] true, but the appointed time [was] long; and he understood the message, and
    
had understanding of the vision.   
  <p>2 In those days I, Daniel, was
    
mourning three full weeks. 
<p>3 I ate no pleasant food, no meat or
    
wine came into my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were
    
fulfilled. 
<p>4 Now on the twenty-fourth day of
    
the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, that [is], the Tigris, 
<p>5 I lifted my eyes and looked, and
    
behold, a certain man clothed in linen, whose waist [was] girded with gold of Uphaz! 
<p>6 His body [was] like beryl, his
    
face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like torches of fire, his arms and feet
    
like burnished bronze in color, and the sound of his words like the voice of a multitude. 
<p>7 And I, Daniel, alone saw the
    
vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great terror fell upon
    
them, so that they fled to hide themselves. 
<p>8 Therefore I was left alone when I
    
saw this great vision, and no strength remained in me; for my vigor was turned to frailty
    
in me, and I retained no strength. 
<p>9 Yet I heard the sound of his
    
words; and while I heard the sound of his words I was in a deep sleep on my face, with my
    
face to the ground. 
<p>10 Suddenly, a hand touched me,
    
which made me tremble on my knees and [on] the palms of my hands. 
<p>11 And he said to me, &quot;O
    
Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright,
    
for I have now been sent to you.&quot; While he was speaking this word to me, I stood
    
trembling. 
<p>12 Then he said to me, &quot;Do not
    
fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble
    
yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words. 
<p>13 &quot;But the prince of the
    
kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; and behold, Michael, one of the chief
    
princes, came to help me, for I had been left alone there with the kings of Persia. 
<p>14 &quot;Now I have come to make you
    
understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision [refers] to
    
[many] days yet [to] [come].&quot; 
<p>15 When he had spoken such words to
    
me, I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless. 
<p>16 And suddenly, [one] having the
    
likeness of the sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke, saying to
    
him who stood before me, &quot;My lord, because of the vision my sorrows have overwhelmed
    
me, and I have retained no strength. 
<p>17 &quot;For how can this servant of
    
my lord talk with you, my lord? As for me, no strength remains in me now, nor is any
    
breath left in me.&quot; 
<p>18 Then again, [the] [one] having
    
the likeness of a man touched me and strengthened me. 
<p>19 And he said, &quot;O man greatly
    
beloved, fear not! Peace [be] to you; be strong, yes, be strong!&quot; So when he spoke to
    
me I was strengthened, and said, &quot;Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened
    
me.&quot; 
<p>20 Then he said, &quot;Do you know
    
why I have come to you? And now I must return to fight with the prince of Persia; and when
    
I have gone forth, indeed the prince of Greece will come.   </font>

noted in the Scripture of Truth. (No one upholds me against these, except Michael your

prince. <br>
