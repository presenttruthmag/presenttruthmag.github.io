  oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.&quot; 64 &quot;Yes,
  it is as you say,&quot; Jesus replied. &quot;But I say to all of you: In the future you
  will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the
  clouds of heaven.&quot;</font><br>
