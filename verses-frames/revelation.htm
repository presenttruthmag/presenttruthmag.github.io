  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christ appointed the aged apostle to John, now an exile on the isle of Patmos, to write &quot;Revelation&quot; in order to give hope and assurance to the suffering, persecuted evangelcal Christian church. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Roman armies of Titus had destroyed the temple at Jerusalem in AD 70 in fulfillment of Christ's Olivet prophecy recorded in Matthew 24 and now the church needed to be assurred that Christ was Lord of all in the &quot;heavenly temple&quot; and in complete control of the flow of history unto the day of His promised second coming in the clouds of heaven with all His holy angels. Using the same basic outline of history as Daniel and employing the same basic symbolism as Daniel, John points the believing evangelical Christians of every generation to the ultimate victory of the Lamb of God over the powers of Satan. The evangelical church of Christ must witness and suffer throughout her earthly sojoun of &quot;1260 (metaphorical) days&quot; at the hands of Satan's cruel and oppressive spiritual kingdom called Babylon. John assures the suffering church that the forces of Satan's kingdom will ultimately not prevail and will finally be destroyed by the &quot;second death&quot;.</font>

    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Seven Churches:</b> In speaking words of comfort, encouragement and even rebuke to the &quot;Seven Churches&quot; of Asia Minor, our Lord addresses the entire evangelical Christian church of all ages. Jesus' warnings against sin and heresy strengthen us even today as we &quot;earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints&quot;. The gnostic heresies which were brought into the infant church of the first century and vigorously opposed by the apostles are still the heresies of today. But now with the passing of time they have been venerated and given &quot;respectability&quot; by the &quot;Man of Sin&quot;, the Papacy, which has usurped and taken over the Christian church. This &quot;man of sin&quot; sits in the &quot;temple of God&quot; and falsely claims to speak for Christ as His &quot;Vicar&quot; but is in fact the &quot;Antichrist&quot;, the &quot;false prophet&quot;.&nbsp; This is the beast with two &quot;horns like unto a lamb&quot; which speaks &quot;as a dragon&quot; who directs the great &quot;falling away&quot; which Paul predicted in 2 Thessalonians 2.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Judgment Scene:</b> John opens to the full view of the church the true meaning of history. Through nearly 6,000 years of blood stained history, men have asked why has all this suffering been permitted. With fists raised to the God of Heaven, men have blamed the God of infinite love for all the heart rending suffering of the human family. In the Judgment we see God's answer to the challenge of who is to blame for all the carnage of history. What is &quot;revealed&quot; in the Revelation is how the &quot;mystery of iniquity&quot; came to be; how it has manifested itself in history; how   God has dealt with it in the gospel of Jesus Christ; and how it will ultimately be <b>justly</b> destroyed by the &quot;second death&quot;. <br>

In the everlasting covenant is revealed how God has handled the sin problem. First in symbols and shadows in the books of Moses&nbsp;&#8212; the first or &quot;Old&quot; covenant&nbsp;&#8212; and then in the reality of God's full and final revelation&nbsp;&#8212; the  &quot;New&quot; covenant in the Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord. Before God can put an end to sin He first must be seen to be just and secondly the verdict of the judgment must be approved by all of God's loyal subjects.</font>

<td>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus we see the 24 elders, the jury of witnesses in the trial of the ages. Two witnesses from each tribe of &quot;spiritual&quot; Israel, the 144,000&nbsp;&#8212; the symbolic term for the evangelical church of our Lord Jesus Christ. The angels in unnumbered multitudes observe in awe as God deals with man in history. His mercy to undeserving sinners who respond to the proclamation of the gospel and call out for salvation and forgiveness brings forth the songs of highest praises from the angelic choirs of heaven. While these witnesses watch Satan's demonic hosts bring suffering and agony to the loyal followers of God, the Lord Jesus fights for the defense of His Church by means of   sword, famine, pestilence,  and wild animals&nbsp;&#8212; the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;, (see also Ezekiel and Zechariah).</font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the beginning of this vision, John weeps because no man is worthy to stand in the judgment to answer and fulfill the one ultimate requirement of  the Law of God &#8212;  perfect righteousness&nbsp;&#8212; a sinless life to stand as the Representative, Substitute, and Redeemer for the Church. Then the Lord   Jesus Christ enters the scene as the Righteous Lamb of God, who through His perfect, sinless life of obedience to the Law of God and His suffering and death on the cross has answered all the demands of the Law.

From apostolic times to the end of time the sufferings resulting from sin and rebellion are graphically symbolized using imagry borrowed from the Tabernacle service of the Old Testament. The &quot;Seven Trumpets&quot; call to mind the Feast of Trumpets  which called ancient Israel to prepare for the great Day of Atonement.&nbsp; On this day the people of God would assemble at the Tabernacle in deep repentance for their sins in order to be covanentally &quot;sealed&quot; in the book of life. Those who refused the trumpet call to &quot;afflict their souls&quot; on the Day of Atonement were &quot;cut off&quot; from the book of life&nbsp;&#8212; the covanental record containing the names of all the families of Israel. <br>
  <br>
  Thus the &quot;trumpet call&quot; of the evangelical gospel of Christ which is proclaimed throughout the world can be a joyful invitation to forgiveness and eternal life to all those who heed the call or &#8212; if rejected &#8212; it can be a warning of imminent doom and woe to all those who refuse the call to repent and trust in Christ's atonement on the cross. <br>
  <br>
  As God's people live through the era of the Seven Trumpets, Satan and his demons afflict and persecute the servants of God causing many tears to flow. Between the sixth and seventh trumpets we are given an overview of the entire Christian era.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Overview of the Seven Trumpet Era:</b> The mighty angel with the &quot;little scroll&quot; (the everlasting covenant of grace) reveals to John that even though no man can make known the day or hour of the end (this is what is sealed up and not revealed to the Church, see Matt. 24:36)&nbsp; the Gospel message must go to the ends of the world before the end shall come.&nbsp; And thus the &quot;bitterness&quot; of the long delay through which the church must not only endure but also prophesy for 1260 symbolic days is portrayed.&nbsp; (<em>The apostles clearly saw that sacred history was divided into two great eras&nbsp;&#8212; the era of the &quot;Old Covenant&quot; with its earthly Temple &#8212; and the era of the &quot;New Covenant&quot; with its heavenly &quot;Temple&quot; where Jesus our great High Priest mediates His blood and rightousness before the Law of God for us. The Old was &quot;ratified&quot; by the blood of bulls and goats.The New was &quot;ratified&quot; by the shed blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. <br>
    <br>
    Thus history can be said to be symbolized by seven years. The first half of history, or &quot;three and a half years&quot;, was seen as that era <strong>from the fall of the First Adam to the incarnation and vicarious atonement of the Second Adam, the Lord Jesus Christ.</strong> The second half of history, or &quot;three and a half years&quot;, was identified as the time <strong>from the cross of Christ to the second coming of our Lord</strong> in power and glory.</em>)</font>

  The &quot;two witnesses&quot; symbolize the evangelical church of Christ proclaiming the word of God to all the world clothed in the garments of mourning and poverty. The Church is described as &quot;two witnesses&quot; because the Covenant required the testimony of at least two witnesses before the Judge could render a verdict  of &quot;life&quot; to the justified forgiven believing sinner or &quot;death&quot;   to the guilty unbelieving unrepentant condemned sinner.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This command of Revelation 11:1 to &quot;measure the temple of God and those who worship therein&quot; begins the series of visions which more narrowly focus upon the evangelical Christian church&nbsp;&#8212; the &quot;temple&quot; of the Living God in which the Spirit of God dwells. <br>
    <br>
  The persecuted evangelical Church will &quot;prophesy&quot; or proclaim the Gospel to all nations, people, languages, and kingdoms throughout the Christian era, here called the &quot;forty-two months&quot;. The unbelieving world (the &quot;gentiles&quot;) will persecute (&quot;trample under foot&quot;) the church (the &quot;holy city&quot;) throughout the symbolic &quot;42 months&quot; or &quot;1260 days&quot; of her sojourn here on earth (42 months = 1260 days = 3½ years).&nbsp; Luke in his gospel account refers to the Christian era   as when &quot;the times of the 'Gentiles' be (are) fulfilled&quot;. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The first vision </b>of this series is the vision of the &quot;two witnesses&quot; who testify for 1260 symbolic days while the Holy City (the true invisible evangelical Church) is trodden down by the &quot;Gentiles&quot; (the unbelieving world). These &quot;two witnesses&quot; are able to withstand their enemies by the power of their   testimony (&quot;fire from their mouth&quot;) and the &quot;plagues&quot; which God causes to fall upon those who seek their harm.&nbsp; But ultimately at the end of their time of testimony their witness is silenced and the unbelieving world totally rejects their testimony.  Finally, however, after a brief period of &quot;three days&quot; (in the symbolism employed here the church recapitulates Christ's three and one half years of ministry, His death, burial,  and then His resurrection and vindication) God Himself vindicates the two witnesses by resurrecting them and exalting them before the eyes of the world.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This vision gives even more details of Satan persecuting the Church. The Christ child is born into the world as the Savior and sin bearer and then ascends into heaven.  Then the evangelical Church is forced to flee into the &quot;wilderness&quot; (Elijah also fled into the &quot;wilderness&quot; for 3 &frac12;  years) of persecution, exile and poverty. We see that Satan, as the result of Christ's victory over death and the grave, is now cast out of heaven and down to the earth where as the &quot;great red dragon&quot; he vents his great wrath against the Woman for 3½ years or &quot;times&quot; (1260 symbolic days).<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This vision gives even more detail regarding the temple of God, the Church.  Now we see John employ another symbol from Daniel the 7<sup>th</sup> chapter. The terrible &quot;beast&quot; of Daniel 7&nbsp;&#8212; the Roman Empire&nbsp;&#8212; is again brought to view as the power which devours and deceives the whole world of John's day . This seven headed beast is the power which rules the world of John's day and dares to seek to fulfill the wrath of the Dragon by making war with the saints of Christ, the suffering evangelical church. Again we see repeated that the persecution lasts &quot;42&quot; symbolic months (there are 30 days in the Hebrew month thus 42 x 30 = 1260 symbolic days).

  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This vision of the Roman Empire here introduces in verse 3 a strange twist which will be mentioned again in verse 11. This great Empire is mortally wounded but he does not die! The deadly wound is &quot;healed&quot; and he lives on again! How does the beast, the Roman Empire, come back to life? <br>
      <br>
  We see that another power arises which is a lamb-like power, with the two horns of a &quot;Lamb&quot;, a deceptive power which breathes renewed life into Rome, but this time as a religious power. This &quot;false prophet&quot; (see Revelation 16:13, 20 and 20:10) which revives Rome is an actual duplicate of the old   Rome after its fall in the 6<sup>th</sup> century AD. This is the same apostate power, the &quot;mystery of iniquity&quot; or lawlessness of which Paul spoke in 2 Thes. 2:7 which would arise after the power which &quot;restrained&quot; it would be &quot;taken out of the way&quot;. <br>
  <br>
After the Roman Emire collapsed in the 6<sup>th</sup> century AD, the great &quot;falling away&quot;, the apostate Roman church, &quot;the false prophet&quot;, took over as the &quot;Holy&quot; Roman Empire headed by the new pontiff calling himself a Pope or the Bishop of Rome. How is the number of his name 666?  The title of the Pope, &quot;Vicar of the Son of God&quot; in Latin is &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot;. The roman numerals contained in this name add up to 666.</font>

A sinner must always confess his sins directly to Jesus and never to any earthly priest! Any religion which places ceremony above simple faith in the finished Atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ is Antichrist.<br>

  It is this Gospel which provides the mercy and unmerited grace needed for all who fear God and worship Him as their Creator and Redeemer to stand in the hour of God's judgment (v. 7). The religion &#8212; the &quot;wine&quot; &#8212; of &quot;Babylon&quot; (the mysteries of the Papacy and other false religions of the world can be traced all the way back to ancient Egypt and ancient Babylon in the worship of Isis and Nimrod) is declared apostate and a spiritual abomination (v. 8-9).

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Roman Empire is the seven headed beast which carries the Antichrist. Rome sits on &quot;seven hills&quot; and to the apostle John the angel states that the rule of the Caesars is soon to end (&quot;five have fallen, one is, and another is to follow&quot;). The empire of these emperors or &quot;pontiffs&quot; will finally fall to be replaced by the &quot;ten horns&quot; into which the Roman Empire would be divided. <br>
    <br>
  The Roman Empire did not disappear however. Rome was divided into the nations of Europe and called the &quot;Holy Roman Empire&quot;. Why was the Empire called &quot;Holy&quot; now? Because the nations of Europe would give their allegiance to a new   &quot;Pontiff&quot;&nbsp;&#8212; the pontiffs of Vatican Rome, the popes. <br>
  <br>
  Thus the popes of Rome have controlled the affairs of Europe and even the world since the &quot;fall&quot; of pagan Rome unto the present time. But ultimately the nations who serve and obey the papacy will hate her when they see   her great fall. The fall of the Antichrist will come about as the result of one final   proclamation of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ just before the end comes. Just as the Protestant Reformation of the 16<sup>th</sup> century greatly weakened the Papacy, a final   Reformation and revival of the true Gospel will mean the end for the &quot;woman sitting on a scarlet beast&quot;. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This vision depicts the final captivity of Satan as he is bound in the desolation of the &quot;pit&quot; for 1,000 years. The redeemed enjoy a 1,000 year Sabbath rest living and reigning with Christ. The final generation of living saints, and the redeemed of all ages who had died in faith who will be raised in the first resurrection, will enjoy 1,000 years of rest and healing with Jesus.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following this 1,000 years, those who followed Satan and worshipped the false gods of this world will be raised again (the second resurrection). Satan will be released from his captivity to deceive the lost once more for one final attempt to destroy the City of God. But fire from heaven will destroy the wicked hosts. Satan will share in the punishment of the beast and the false prophet &#8212; the trinity of evil &#8212; in the &quot;lake of fire&quot; (the &quot;second&quot; or final death).
