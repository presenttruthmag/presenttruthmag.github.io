  <p><I>Matt. 16:16-19</I>  
  <p>16 Simon Peter answered and said, &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the living
  God.&quot; 17 Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for
  flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. 18
&quot;And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My <strong>church</strong>,
  and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. 19 &quot;And I will give you the keys
  of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and
  whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.&quot;<br>
  <p><i>Acts 2:37-47</i>  
  <p>37 Now when they heard [this], they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the
  rest of the apostles, &quot;Men and brethren, what shall we do?&quot; 38 Then Peter said
  to them, &quot;Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
  for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 &quot;For
  the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the
  Lord our God will call.&quot; 40 And with many other words he testified and exhorted them,
  saying, &quot;Be saved from this perverse generation.&quot; 41 Then those who gladly
  received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls were added to
  them. 42 And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the
  breaking of bread, and in prayers. 43 Then fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and
  signs were done through the apostles. 44 Now all who believed were together, and had all
  things in common, 45 and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as
  anyone had need. 46 So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread
  from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, 47
  praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the <strong>church</strong> daily
  those who were being saved.<br>

the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence.<br>
