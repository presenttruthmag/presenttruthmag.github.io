<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Heb 10:14-18</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified. 15 But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before, 16 "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them," 17 then He adds, "Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more." 18 Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.
