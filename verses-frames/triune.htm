  <p><i>Matt. 28:19</i>  
  <p>19 &quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, <br>
    
<p><i>John 14:8-18</i>
<p>8 Philip said to Him, &quot;Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us.&quot; 9 Jesus said to him, &quot;Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, `Show us the Father'? 10 &quot;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own [authority]; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works. 11 &quot;Believe Me that I [am] in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the sake of the works themselves. 12 &quot; Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater [works] than these he will do, because I go to My Father. 13 &quot;And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 &quot;If you ask anything in My name, I will do [it]. 15 &quot; If you love Me, keep My commandments. 16 &quot;And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever-- 17 &quot;the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you. 18 &quot;I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.<br>

  <p><i>1 John 2:20-27</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things. 21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also. 24 Therefore let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that He has promised us--eternal life. 26 These things I have written to you concerning those who [try] [to] deceive you. 27 But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him. <br>
