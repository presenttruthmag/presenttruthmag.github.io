  <p>:1 (NKJV) Then I stood on the sand
  of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns,
  and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name.   
  <p>2 Now the beast which I saw was like
  a leopard, his feet were like [the] [feet] [of] a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a
  lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.   
  <p>3 And [I] [saw] one of his heads as
  if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world
  marveled and followed the beast.   
  <p>4 So they worshiped the dragon who
  gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, &quot;Who [is] like the
  beast? Who is able to make war with him?&quot;   
  <p>5 And he was given a mouth speaking
  great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months.
  <p>6 Then he opened his mouth in
  blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in
  heaven.   
  <p>7 It was granted to him to make war
  with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe,
  tongue, and nation.   
  <p>8 All who dwell on the earth will
  worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from
  the foundation of the world.   
  <p>9 If anyone has an ear, let him
  hear.   
  <p>10 He who leads into captivity shall
  go into captivity; he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the
  patience and the faith of the saints.   
  <p>11 Then I saw another beast coming
  up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.   
  <p>12 And he exercises all the
  authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in
  it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.   
  <p>13 He performs great signs, so that
  he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men.   
  <p>14 And he deceives those who dwell
  on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling
  those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword
  and lived.   
  <p>15 He was granted [power] to give
  breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause
  as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.   
  <p>16 He causes all, both small and
  great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their
  foreheads,   
  <p>17 and that no one may buy or sell
  except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.   
  <p>18 Here is wisdom. Let him who has
  understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number
  [is] 666.  </font>

  <p>1 Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb
  standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred [and] forty-four thousand, having His
  Father's name written on their foreheads.   
  <p>2 And I heard a voice from heaven,
  like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And I heard the sound
  of harpists playing their harps.   
  <p>3 They sang as it were a new song
  before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could
  learn that song except the hundred [and] forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the
  earth.   
  <p>4 These are the ones who were not
  defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever
  He goes. These were redeemed from [among] men, [being] firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
  <p>5 And in their mouth was found no
  deceit, for they are without fault before the throne of God.   
  <p>6 Then I saw another angel flying in
  the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the
  earth--to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people--   
  <p>7 saying with a loud voice, &quot;Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship
  Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.&quot;   
  <p>8 And another angel followed,
  saying, &quot;Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all
  nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.&quot;   
  <p>9 Then a third angel followed them,
    saying with a loud voice, &quot;If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives
  [his] mark on his forehead or on his hand,   
  <p>10 &quot;he himself shall also drink
    of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His
    indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy
  angels and in the presence of the Lamb.   
  <p>11 &quot;And the smoke of their
  torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the
  beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.&quot;   
  <p>12 Here is the patience of the
  saints; here [are] those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.   
  <p>13 Then I heard a voice from heaven
  saying to me, &quot;Write: `Blessed [are] the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'
&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; says the Spirit, &quot;that they may rest from their labors, and
  their works follow them.&quot;   
  <p>14 Then I looked, and behold, a
  white cloud, and on the cloud sat [One] like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden
  crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.   
  <p>15 And another angel came out of the
  temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, &quot;Thrust in Your sickle
  and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth is
  ripe.&quot;   
  <p>16 So He who sat on the cloud thrust
  in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.   
  <p>17 Then another angel came out of
  the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.   
  <p>18 And another angel came out from
  the altar, who had power over fire, and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp
  sickle, saying, &quot;Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of
  the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.&quot;   
  <p>19 So the angel thrust his sickle
  into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw [it] into the great winepress
  of the wrath of God.     
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 And the winepress was trampled
outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, up to the horses' bridles, for one
thousand six hundred furlongs. <br>
