  <p><i>Rev. 20:2-6</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 He laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is [the] Devil and Satan, and
  bound him for a thousand years; 3 and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him
  up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand
  years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while. 4 And
  I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then [I] [saw]
  the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of
  God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received [his] mark on
  their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand
  years. 5 But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were
  finished. This [is] the first resurrection. 6 Blessed and holy [is] he who has part in the
  first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of
  God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.<br>
