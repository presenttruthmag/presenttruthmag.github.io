  <p><i>Rom. 3:23-26</i></br>
  <p>23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 being justified freely byHis grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 25 whom God set forth [as] a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, 26 to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</br>

  <p><i><br>
  Rom. 4:5-8, 22-25</i></br>
  <p>5 But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness, 6 just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works: 7 &quot;Blessed [are] [those] whose lawless deeds are forgiven, And whose sins are covered; 8 Blessed [is] [the] man to whom the Lord shall not impute sin.&quot;</br>
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 And therefore &quot;it was accounted to him for righteousness.&quot; 23 Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him, 24 but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who believe in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, 25 who was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification.</br>
