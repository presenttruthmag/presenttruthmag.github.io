<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">32 &quot;And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&quot; 33 They answered Him, &quot;We are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can you say, 'You will be made free'?&quot; 34 Jesus answered them, &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin. 35 &quot;And a slave does not abide in the house forever, but a son abides forever. 36 &quot;Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed. </font>
