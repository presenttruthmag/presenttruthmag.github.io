  <p>1 (NKJV) Then I saw another sign in
  heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them the
  wrath of God is complete.     
  <p>2 And I saw [something] like a sea
  of glass mingled with fire, and those who have the victory over the beast, over his image
  and over his mark [and] over the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having
  harps of God.     
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 They sing the song of Moses, the
  servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, &quot;Great and marvelous [are] Your
works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true [are] Your ways, O King of the saints! </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 Who shall not fear You, O Lord,
    and glorify Your name? For [You] alone [are] holy. For all nations shall come and
    worship before You, For Your judgments have been
    manifested.&quot;   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 After these things I looked, and
    behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 And out of the temple came the
    seven angels having the seven plagues, clothed in pure bright linen, and having their
    chests girded with golden bands.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Then one of the four living
    creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives
    forever and ever.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 The temple was filled with smoke
    from the glory of God and from His power, and no one was able to enter the temple till the
    seven plagues of the seven angels were completed. </font>
<p><font color="#993366" size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="16"><b>Revelation 16:</b></a> </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16:1 Then I heard a loud voice from
    the temple saying to the seven angels, &quot;Go and pour out the bowls of the wrath of God
    on the earth.&quot;   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 So the first went and poured out
    his bowl upon the earth, and a foul and loathsome sore came upon the men who had the mark
    of the beast and those who worshiped his image.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 Then the second angel poured out
    his bowl on the sea, and it became blood as of a dead [man]; and every living creature in
    the sea died.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 Then the third angel poured out
    his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 And I heard the angel of the
    waters saying: &quot;You are righteous, O Lord, The One who is and who was and who
    is to be, Because You have judged these
    things. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 For they have shed the blood of
    saints and prophets, And You have given them blood to
    drink. <br>
&nbsp; For it is their just due.&quot; </font>  
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 And I heard another from the altar
    saying, &quot;Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous [are] Your judgments.&quot;   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Then the fourth angel poured out
    his bowl on the sun, and power was given to him to scorch men with fire.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 And men were scorched with great
    heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues; and they did
    not repent and give Him glory.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 Then the fifth angel poured out
    his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became full of darkness; and they
    gnawed their tongues because of the pain.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 They blasphemed the God of heaven
    because of their pains and their sores, and did not repent of their deeds.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Then the sixth angel poured out
    his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way of the
    kings from the east might be prepared.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 And I saw three unclean spirits
    like frogs [coming] out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out
    of the mouth of the false prophet.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 For they are spirits of demons,
    performing signs, [which] go out to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to
    gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 &quot;Behold, I am coming as a
    thief. Blessed [is] he who watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they
    see his shame.&quot;   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 And they gathered them together
    to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 Then the seventh angel poured out
    his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven, from the throne,
    saying, &quot;It is done!&quot;   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 And there were noises and
    thunderings and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such a mighty and great
    earthquake as had not occurred since men were on the earth.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 Now the great city was divided
    into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And great Babylon was remembered
    before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 Then every island fled away, and
the mountains were not found. </font>  
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 And great hail from heaven fell
upon men, [each] [hailstone] about the weight of a talent. Men blasphemed God because of
the plague of the hail, since that plague was exceedingly great.</font>
