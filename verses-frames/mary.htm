<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to
    a city of Galilee named Nazareth, 27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph,
    of the house of David. The virgin's name [was] Mary. 28 And having come in, the angel said
    to her, &quot;Rejoice, highly favored [one], the Lord [is] with you; blessed [are] you
    among women!&quot; 29 But when she saw [him], she was troubled at his saying, and
    considered what manner of greeting this was. 30 Then the angel said to her, &quot;Do not
    be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 &quot;And behold, you will conceive
    in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name Jesus. 32 &quot;He will be
    great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the
    throne of His father David. 33 &quot;And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever,
    and of His kingdom there will be no end.&quot; 34 Then Mary said to the angel, &quot;How
    can this be, since I do not know a man?&quot; 35 And the angel answered and said to her,
  &quot;[The] Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow
    you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother
  Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the
  Holy Spirit. 19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just [man], and not wanting to make her a
  public example, was minded to put her away secretly. 20 But while he thought about these
  things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &quot;Joseph, son
  of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in
  her is of the Holy Spirit. 21 &quot;And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His
  name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.&quot; 22 So all this was done
  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: 23
  &quot;Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name
  Immanuel,&quot; which is translated, &quot;God with us.&quot; 24 Then Joseph, being
  aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife,
  25 and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His
  name Jesus.<br>
