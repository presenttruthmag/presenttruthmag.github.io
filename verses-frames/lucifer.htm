<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 It shall come to pass in the day the Lord gives you rest from your sorrow, and from
your fear and the hard bondage in which you were made to serve, 4 that you will take up
this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say: &quot;How the oppressor has ceased, The
golden city ceased! 5 The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, The scepter of the
rulers; 6 He who struck the people in wrath with a continual stroke, He who ruled the
nations in anger, Is persecuted [and] no one hinders. 7 The whole earth is at rest [and]
quiet; They break forth into singing. 8 Indeed the cypress trees rejoice over you, [And]
the cedars of Lebanon, [Saying], `Since you were cut down, No woodsman has come up against
us.' 9 &quot;Hell from beneath is excited about you, To meet [you] at your coming; It
stirs up the dead for you, All the chief ones of the earth; It has raised up from their
thrones All the kings of the nations. 10 They all shall speak and say to you: `Have you
also become as weak as we? Have you become like us? 11 Your pomp is brought down to Sheol,
[And] the sound of your stringed instruments; The maggot is spread under you, And worms
cover you.' 12 &quot;How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! [How]
you are cut down to the ground, You who weakened the nations! 13 For you have said in your
heart: `I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will
also sit on the mount of the congregation On the farthest sides of the north; 14 I will
ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.' 15 Yet you shall be
brought down to Sheol, To the lowest depths of the Pit. 16 &quot;Those who see you will
gaze at you, [And] consider you, [saying]: `[Is] this the man who made the earth tremble,
Who shook kingdoms, 17 Who made the world as a wilderness And destroyed its cities, [Who]
did not open the house of his prisoners?'<br>
