  <p><i>Eph. 2:10</i>  
  <p>10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.<br>

  <p><i>Eph. 4:1-3, 17</i>  
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to walk worthy of the calling with which you were called, 2 with all lowliness and gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love, 3 endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. . . . 17 This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind,<br>

  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><i>Eph. 5:21</i>  
  <p>21 submitting to one another in the fear of God.<br> 
  <p><i>Eph. 3:16-19</i>  
  <p>16 from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love. 17 This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind, 18 having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart; 19 who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lewdness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.<br>

  <p><i>Phil. 2:1-4</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Therefore if [there] [is] any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy, 2 fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, [being] of one accord, of one mind. 3 [Let] nothing [be] [done] through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. 4 Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.<br>
