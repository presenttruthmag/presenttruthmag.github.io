</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4</b>:1 (NKJV) After
  these things I looked, and behold, a door [standing] open in heaven. And the first voice
  which I heard [was] like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, &quot;Come up here, and I
  will show you things which must take place after this.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  2 Immediately I was in the Spirit;
  and behold, a throne set in heaven, and [One] sat on the throne. <br>
  <br>
  3 And He who sat there was like a
  jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and [there] [was] a rainbow around the throne,
  in appearance like an emerald. <br>
  <br>
  4 Around the throne [were]
  twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white
  robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads. <br>
  <br>
  5 And from the throne proceeded
  lightnings, thunderings, and voices. Seven lamps of fire [were] burning before the throne,
  which are the seven Spirits of God. <br>
  <br>
  6 Before the throne [there] [was] a
  sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, [were]
  four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. <br>
  <br>
  7 The first living creature [was]
  like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face
  like a man, and the fourth living creature [was] like a flying eagle. <br>
  <br>
  8 [The] four living creatures, each
  having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night,
  saying: &quot;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!&quot;
  <br>
  <br>
  9 Whenever the living creatures give
  glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, <br>
  <br>
  10 the twenty-four elders fall down
  before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast
  their crowns before the throne, saying: <br>
  <br>
  11 &quot;You are worthy, O Lord, <font size="3">To receive glory and honor and power; </font></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For You created all things, </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And by Your will they exist and were
  created.&quot; </font>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5</b>:1 And I saw in
  the right [hand] of Him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back,
  sealed with seven seals. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 Then I saw a strong angel
  proclaiming with a loud voice, &quot;Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loose its
  seals?&quot; <br>
  <br>
</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  3 And no one in heaven or on the
  earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 So I wept much, because no one was
  found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look at it. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 But one of the elders said to me, &quot;Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has
  prevailed to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals.&quot; </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 And I looked, and behold, in the
  midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders,
  stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the
  seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Then He came and took the scroll
  out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Now when He had taken the scroll,
  the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each
  having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 And they sang a new song, saying: &quot;You are worthy to take the
  scroll,&nbsp; And to open its seals;&nbsp; For You were slain,&nbsp; And have redeemed us to God by Your
  blood Out of every tribe and tongue and
  people and nation, </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 And have made us kings and
  priests to our God; And we shall reign on the
  earth.&quot; </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Then I looked, and I heard the
  voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the
  number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 saying with a loud voice: </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Worthy is the Lamb who was
  slain </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To receive power and riches and
  wisdom, </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And strength and honor and glory and
  blessing!&quot; </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 And every creature which is in
  heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are
  in them, I heard saying: &quot;Blessing and honor and glory
  and power [Be] to Him who sits on the throne,&nbsp; And to the Lamb, forever and
  ever!&quot; </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Then the four living creatures
  said, &quot;Amen!&quot; And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped Him who lives
  forever and ever. </font>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6</b>:1 Now I saw when
  the Lamb opened one of the seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with
  a voice like thunder, &quot;Come and see.&quot; </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 And I looked, and behold, a white
  horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out
  conquering and to conquer. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 When He opened the second seal, I
  heard the second living creature saying, &quot;Come and see.&quot; </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 Another horse, fiery red, went
  out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that
  [people] should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 When He opened the third seal, I
  heard the third living creature say, &quot;Come and see.&quot; So I looked, and behold, a
  black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 And I heard a voice in the midst
  of the four living creatures saying, &quot;A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three
  quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.&quot; </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 When He opened the fourth seal, I
  heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, &quot;Come and see.&quot; </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 So I looked, and behold, a pale
  horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power
  was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death,
  and by the beasts of the earth. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 When He opened the fifth seal, I
  saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the
  testimony which they held. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 And they cried with a loud voice,
  saying, &quot;How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on
  those who dwell on the earth?&quot; </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Then a white robe was given to
  each of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until
  both [the] [number] [of] their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as
  they [were], was completed. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 I looked when He opened the sixth
  seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of
  hair, and the moon became like blood. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 And the stars of heaven fell to
  the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Then the sky receded as a scroll
  when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place. </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 And the kings of the earth, the
  great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man,
  hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 and said to the mountains and
  rocks, &quot;Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from
  the wrath of the Lamb! </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 &quot;For the great day of His
  wrath has come, and who is able to stand?&quot; <br>
