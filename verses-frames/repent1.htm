  <p><i>Luke 24:46, 47</i>  
  <p>46 Then He said to them, &quot;Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, 47 &quot;and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<br>



  <p><i>Acts 3:19</i>  
  <p>19 &quot;Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, <br>
    

    
<p><i>Acts 2:38</i>
<p>Then Peter said to them, &quot;Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.<br>
    

    
<p><i>Heb 9:14</i>  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
