  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 Now while I [was] speaking, praying, and confessing my sin
  and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for
  the holy mountain of my God, 21 yes, while I [was] speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel,
  whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, reached me
  about the time of the evening offering. 22 And he informed [me], and talked with me, and
  said, &quot;O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you skill to understand. 23 &quot;At
  the beginning of your supplications the command went out, and I have come to tell [you],
  for you [are] greatly beloved; therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision:</font><br>
