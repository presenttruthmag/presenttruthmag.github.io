not wise.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Prov. 23: 29-35</I></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has wounds
without cause? Who has redness of eyes? 30 Those who linger long at the <strong>wine</strong>, Those who go
in search of <strong>mixed wine.</strong> 31 Do not look on the <strong>wine</strong> when it is red, When it sparkles in
the cup, When it swirls around smoothly; 32 At the last it bites like a serpent, And
stings like a viper. 33 Your eyes will see strange things, And your heart will utter
perverse things. 34 Yes, you will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, Or
like one who lies at the top of the mast, saying: 35 &quot;They have struck me, but I
was not hurt; They have beaten me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake, that I may
seek another <strong>drink</strong>?&quot;</font><br>
