  <p><i>John 3:5</i>  
  <p>Jesus answered, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.<br>
    

    
<p><i>1 Cor 2:14</i>
<p>But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness<br> 
  to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.<br>
