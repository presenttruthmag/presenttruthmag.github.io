  <p><i>Ps. 51:10-12</i>  
  <P>10 Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit
  within me. 11 Do not cast me away from Your presence, And do not take Your Holy Spirit
  from me. 12 Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, And uphold me [by] [Your] generous
  Spirit.<br>
  
  <p><i>Rom. 15:13</i>  
  <p>13 Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.<br>

  <p><i>Eph. 3:16-21</i>  
  <p>16 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, 17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what [is] the width and length and depth and height-- 19 to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. 20 Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, 21 to Him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.<br>

  <p><i>2 Cor. 12:9-10</i>  
  <p>9 And He said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.&quot; Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.<br>

  <p><i>2 Th. 1:11-12</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of [His] goodness and the work of faith with power, 12 that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
