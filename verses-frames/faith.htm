  1 Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and
  everyone who loves Him who begot also loves him who is begotten of Him. . . . .4 For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has
  overcome the world--our faith. . . . . </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 This is He who came by water and blood--Jesus Christ; not only by water, but by water
  and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.<br>
