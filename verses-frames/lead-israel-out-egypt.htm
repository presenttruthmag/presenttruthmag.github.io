  <p><i>Ex. 3:1-17</i>  
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law,
  the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb,
  the mountain of God. 2 And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from
  the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the
  bush [was] not consumed. 3 Then Moses said, &quot;I will now turn aside and see this great
  sight, why the bush does not burn.&quot; 4 So when the Lord saw that he turned aside to
  look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, &quot;Moses, Moses!&quot; And
  he said, &quot;Here I am.&quot; 5 Then He said, &quot;Do not draw near this place. Take
  your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand [is] holy ground.&quot; 6
  Moreover He said, &quot;I [am] the God of your father--the God of Abraham, the God of
  Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&quot; And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon
  God. 7 And the Lord said: &quot;I have surely seen the oppression of My people who [are]
  in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.
  8 &quot;So I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring
  them up from that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to
  the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the
  Hivites and the Jebusites. 9 &quot;Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of
  Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians
  oppress them. 10 &quot;Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may
  bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.&quot; 11 But Moses said to God,
  &quot;Who [am] I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of
  Israel out of Egypt?&quot; 12 So He said, &quot;I will certainly be with you. And this
  [shall] [be] a sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of
  Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.&quot; 13 Then Moses said to God,
  &quot;Indeed, [when] I come to the children of Israel and say to them, `The God of your
  fathers has sent me to you,' and they say to me, `What [is] His name?' what shall I say to
  them?&quot; 14 And God said to Moses, &quot;I AM WHO I AM.&quot; And He said, &quot;Thus
  you shall say to the children of Israel, `I AM has sent me to you.' &quot; 15 Moreover God
  said to Moses, &quot;Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: `The Lord God of your
  fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.
  This [is] My name forever, and this [is] My memorial to all generations.' 16 &quot;Go and
  gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, `The Lord God of your fathers, the
  God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, &quot;I have surely
  visited you and [seen] what is done to you in Egypt; 17 &quot;and I have said I will bring
  you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and
  the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with
  milk and honey.&quot; '<br>
