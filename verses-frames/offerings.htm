  <p><I>2 Cor. 9:6-9</I>  
  <p>6 But this [I] [say]: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows
  bountifully will also reap bountifully. 7 [So] [let] each one [give] as he purposes in his
  heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver. 8 And God [is] able
  to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all
  [things], may have an abundance for every good work. 9 As it is written: &quot;He has
  dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.&quot;<br>
  

  <p><i>Phil. 4:15-17</i>  
  <p>15 Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed
  from Macedonia, no church shared with me concerning giving and receiving but you only. 16
  For even in Thessalonica you sent [aid] once and again for my necessities. 17 Not that I
  seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that abounds to your account.<br>
  
  <p><I>1 Cor. 9:7-14</I></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Who ever goes to war at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of
its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk of the flock? 8 Do I say
these things as a [mere] man? Or does not the law say the same also? 9 For it is written
in the law of Moses, &quot;You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.&quot; Is it oxen God is concerned about? 10 Or does He say [it] altogether for our sakes? For
our sakes, no doubt, [this] is written, that he who plows should plow in hope, and he who
threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope. 11 If we have sown spiritual things for
you, [is] [it] a great thing if we reap your material things? 12 If others are partakers
of [this] right over you, [are] we not even more? Nevertheless we have not used this
right, but endure all things lest we hinder the gospel of Christ. 13 Do you not know that
those who minister the holy things eat [of] [the] [things] of the temple, and those who
serve at the altar partake of [the] [offerings] [of] the altar? 14 Even so the Lord has
commanded that those who preach the gospel should live from the gospel.<br>
