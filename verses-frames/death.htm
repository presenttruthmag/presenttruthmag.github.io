<p><i>Gen. 3:22-24</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 And the LORD God said, &quot;The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.&quot; 23 So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. 24 After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.</font><br>
