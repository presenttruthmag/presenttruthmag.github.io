  <p><i>Romans 4:3-8</i>  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 For what does the Scripture say? &quot;Abraham believed God, and it was <strong>accounted</strong> to him for righteousness.&quot; 4 Now to him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt. 5 But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is <strong>accounted</strong> for righteousness, 6 just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God <strong>imputes righteousness</strong> apart from works: 7 &quot;Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, And whose sins are covered; 8 Blessed is the man to whom the LORD shall not<strong> impute</strong> sin.&quot;
