  <p><i>Rom. 4:6, 11, 22</i></br>
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works: . . . 11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he] [had] [while] [still] uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are uncircumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also, . . . . 22 And therefore &quot;it was accounted to him for righteousness.&quot;</br>
