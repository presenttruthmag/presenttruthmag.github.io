<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the
dragon and his angels fought, 8 but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them
in heaven any longer. 9 So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the
Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels
were cast out with him.<br>
