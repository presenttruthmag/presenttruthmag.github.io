  <p><i>Matt. 5:44</i>  
  <p>44 &quot;But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you,<br>
    
<p><i>Rom. 12:20</i>
<p>20 Therefore &quot;If your enemy is hungry, feed him; If he is thirsty, give him a drink; For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.&quot;<br>

  <p><i>Phi. 3:18</i>  
  <p>18 For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that]
  [they] [are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:<br>

  <p><i>Heb. 10:13</i>  
  <p>13 from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool.<br>

  <p><i>1 Cor. 15:25</i>  
  <p>25 For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet.<br>

  <p><i>Jam. 4:4</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity
  with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of
  God.<br>
