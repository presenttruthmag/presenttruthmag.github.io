  <p><i>Neh. 9:17,31</i>  
  <p>17 They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them.
  They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to
  their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and
  abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them . . .31 But in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are
  a gracious and merciful God.<br>
  <p><i>Ps. 103:8-18</i>  
  <p>8 The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love. 9 He will
  not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever; 10 he does not treat us as our
  sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. 11 For as high as the heavens are
  above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; 12 as far as the east is
  from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. 13 As a father has
  compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him; 14 for he
  knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust. 15 As for man, his days are like
  grass, he flourishes like a flower of the field; 16 the wind blows over it and it is gone,
  and its place remembers it no more. 17 But from everlasting to everlasting the LORD's love
  is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children's children-- 18 with
  those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.<br>
  <p><i>Luke. 6:36</i>  
  <p>36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.<br>
  <p><i>Heb. 8:12</i></br>
