  <p><i>Is. 40:12-31</i>    
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, or with the breadth of his
  hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, or weighed
  the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance? 13 Who has understood the <strong>mind of
the LORD</strong>, or instructed him as his counselor? </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Whom did the LORD consult to enlighten
    him, and who taught him the right way? Who was it that taught him knowledge or showed him
    the path of understanding? 15 Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket; they are
regarded as dust on the scales; he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust. </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16
      Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires, nor its animals enough for burnt offerings. 17
      Before him all the nations are as nothing; they are regarded by him as worthless and less
      than nothing. 18 To whom, then, will you compare God? What image will you compare him to?
</font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 As for an idol, a craftsman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and
        fashions silver chains for it. 20 A man too poor to present such an offering selects wood
        that will not rot. He looks for a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not
topple. </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the
          beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded? 22 He sits enthroned above
          the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the
heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in. </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 He brings princes
            to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. 24 No sooner are they planted,
            no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them
and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff. </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 &quot;To whom will you
              compare me? Or who is my equal?&quot; says the Holy One. 26 Lift your eyes and look to the
              heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls
              them each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is
missing. </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">27 Why do you say, O Jacob, and complain, O Israel, &quot;My way is hidden from
                the LORD; my cause is disregarded by my God&quot;? 28 Do you not know? Have you not heard?
                The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow
tired or weary, and <strong>his understanding</strong> no one can fathom. </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">29 He gives strength to the weary
                  and increases the power of the weak. 30 Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men
                  stumble and fall; 31 but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will
                  soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be
                faint. </font>
