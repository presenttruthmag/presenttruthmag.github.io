  <p><i>Rom. 7:23</i>  
  <p>23 But I see another law in my members, <strong>warring</strong> against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.<br>
  <p><i>2 Cor. 10:3-6</i>  
  <p>3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not <strong>war</strong> according to the flesh. 4 For the weapons of our <strong>warfare</strong> are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, 6 and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.<br>
  <p><i>2 Tim. 1:18</i>  
  <p>18 This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good <strong>warfare</strong>,<br>
  <p><i>2 Tim. 2:3-7</i>  
  <p>3 You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 4 No one engaged in <strong>warfare</strong> entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier. <br>
  <p><i>Heb. 12:4</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 You have not yet <strong>resisted</strong> to bloodshed, striving against sin.<br>
