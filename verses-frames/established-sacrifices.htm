  <p><I>Lev. 1:1-4</I></p>
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Now the Lord called to Moses, and spoke to him from the
  tabernacle of meeting, saying, 2 &quot;Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them:
  `When any one of you brings an offering to the Lord, you shall bring your offering of the
  livestock--of the herd and of the flock. 3 `If his offering [is] a burnt sacrifice of the
  herd, let him offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it of his own free will at the
  door of the tabernacle of meeting before the Lord. 4 `Then he shall put his hand on the
  head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for
him. </font>
