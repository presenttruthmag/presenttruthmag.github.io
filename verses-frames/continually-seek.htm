  <p><i>John 8:31</i>  
  <p>31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, &quot;<strong>If you abide in My word</strong>, you are My disciples indeed.<br>
<p><i>John 15:9-14</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 &quot;As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; <strong>abide in My love</strong>. 10 &quot;If you keep My commandments, you will <strong>abide</strong> in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love. 11 &quot;These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and [that] your joy may be full. 12 &quot;This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. 13 &quot;Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one's life for his friends. 14 &quot;You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.</font><br>
