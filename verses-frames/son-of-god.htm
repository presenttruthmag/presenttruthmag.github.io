  <p><i>Matt. 26:63-64</i>  
  <p>63 But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, &quot;I put You
  under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!&quot; 64
  Jesus said to him, &quot;[It] [is] [as] you said. Nevertheless, I say to you, hereafter
  you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the
  clouds of heaven.&quot;<br>

  <p><i>Matt. 27:54</i>  
  <p>54 So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the
  earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, &quot;Truly this
  was the Son of God!&quot;<br>

  <p><i>Dan. 3:25</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 &quot;Look!&quot; he answered, &quot;I see four men loose, walking in the midst of
  the fire; and they are not hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.&quot;<br>
