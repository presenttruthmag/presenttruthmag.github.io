  <p>8</strong>:1 (NKJV) When He
  opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.   
  <p>2 And I saw the seven angels who
  stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.   
  <p>3 Then another angel, having a
  golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense, that he should
  offer [it] with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the
  throne.   
  <p>4 And the smoke of the incense, with
  the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel's hand.   
  <p>5 Then the angel took the censer,
  filled it with fire from the altar, and threw [it] to the earth. And there were noises,
  thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.   
  <p>6 So the seven angels who had the
  seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.   
  <p>7 The first angel sounded: And hail
  and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. And a third of
  the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.   
  <p>8 Then the second angel sounded: And
  [something] like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third
  of the sea became blood.   
  <p>9 And a third of the living
  creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.   
  <p>10 Then the third angel sounded: And
  a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers
  and on the springs of water.   
  <p>11 The name of the star is Wormwood.
  A third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the water, because it was
  made bitter.   
  <p>12 Then the fourth angel sounded:
  And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that
  a third of them were darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.   
  <p>13 And I looked, and I heard an
  angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, &quot;Woe, woe, woe to
  the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three
  angels who are about to sound!&quot;  </font>

  <p>9</strong>:1 Then the fifth
  angel sounded: And I saw a star fallen from heaven to the earth. To him was given the key
  to the bottomless pit.   
  <p>2 And he opened the bottomless pit,
  and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. So the sun and the air
  were darkened because of the smoke of the pit.   
  <p>3 Then out of the smoke locusts came
  upon the earth. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.   
  <p>4 They were commanded not to harm
  the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not
  have the seal of God on their foreheads.   
  <p>5 And they were not given
  [authority] to kill them, but to torment them [for] five months. Their torment [was] like
  the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.   
  <p>6 In those days men will seek death
  and will not find it; they will desire to die, and death will flee from them.   
  <p>7 The shape of the locusts was like
  horses prepared for battle. On their heads were crowns of something like gold, and their
  faces [were] like the faces of men.   
  <p>8 They had hair like women's hair,
  and their teeth were like lions' [teeth].   
  <p>9 And they had breastplates like
  breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings [was] like the sound of chariots with
  many horses running into battle.   
  <p>10 They had tails like scorpions,
  and there were stings in their tails. Their power [was] to hurt men five months.   
  <p>11 And they had as king over them
  the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew [is] Abaddon, but in Greek he has
  the name Apollyon.   
  <p>12 One woe is past. Behold, still
  two more woes are coming after these things.   
  <p>13 Then the sixth angel sounded: And
  I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,   
  <p>14 saying to the sixth angel who had
  the trumpet, &quot;Release the four angels who are bound at the great river
  Euphrates.&quot;   
  <p>15 So the four angels, who had been
  prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a third of
  mankind.   
  <p>16 Now the number of the army of the
  horsemen [was] two hundred million; I heard the number of them.   
  <p>17 And thus I saw the horses in the
  vision: those who sat on them had breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur
  yellow; and the heads of the horses [were] like the heads of lions; and out of their
  mouths came fire, smoke, and brimstone.   
  <p>18 By these three [plagues] a third
  of mankind was killed--by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their
  mouths.   
  <p>19 For their power is in their mouth
  and in their tails; for their tails [are] like serpents, having heads; and with them they
  do harm.   
  <p>20 But the rest of mankind, who were
  not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should
  not worship demons, and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, which can neither
  see nor hear nor walk.
