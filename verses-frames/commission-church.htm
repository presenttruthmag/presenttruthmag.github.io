  <p><I>Matt. 28:18-19</I>  
  <p>18 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, &quot;All authority has been given to Me
  in heaven and on earth. 19 &quot;<strong>Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations</strong>,
  baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,<br>
  <p><I>Luke 24:46-49</I>  
  <p>46 Then He said to them, &quot;Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the
  Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, 47 &quot;and that repentance and
  remission of sins should be <strong>preached in His name to all nations</strong>, beginning at Jerusalem.
  48 &quot;And you are witnesses of these things. 49 &quot;Behold, I send the Promise of My
  Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from
  on high.&quot;<br>
  <p><I>Mark 16:15-16</I>  
  <p>15 And He said to them, &quot;<strong>Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every
  creature.</strong> 16 &quot;He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not
  believe will be condemned.<br>
  <p><I>John 20:21-23</I>  
  <p>21 So Jesus said to them again, &quot;Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also
  send you.&quot; 22 And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them,
&quot;Receive the Holy Spirit. 23 &quot;If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven
  them; if you retain the [sins] of any, they are retained.&quot;<br>
  
  <p><I>Acts 1:8</I></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 &quot;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you
shall be <strong>witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the
earth.&quot;<br>
