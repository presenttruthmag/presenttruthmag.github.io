<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 And the Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, "This Man receives sinners and eats with them."<br>

3 So He spoke this parable to them, saying:<br>
4 "What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?<br>
5 "And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.<br>
6 "And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'<br>
7 "I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance. <br>
