  <p><I>1 Tim. 3:8-13</I></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Likewise deacons [must] [be] reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine,
not greedy for money, 9 holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience. 10 But
let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being [found] blameless.
11 Likewise [their] wives [must] [be] reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all
things. 12 Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling [their] children and their own
houses well. 13 For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a good
standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</font><br>
