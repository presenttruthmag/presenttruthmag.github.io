  <p><i>Matt. 24:4-31</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 And Jesus answered and said to them: &quot;Take heed that no one deceives you. 5
  &quot;For many will come in My name, saying, `I am the Christ,' and will deceive many. 6
  &quot;And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all
  [these] [things] must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7 &quot;For nation will rise
  against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and
  earthquakes in various places. 8 &quot;All these [are] the beginning of sorrows. 9
  &quot;Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by
  all nations for My name's sake. 10 &quot;And then many will be offended, will betray one
  another, and will hate one another. 11 &quot;Then many false prophets will rise up and
  deceive many. 12 &quot;And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow
  cold. 13 &quot;But he who endures to the end shall be saved. 14 &quot;And this gospel of
  the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then
  the end will come. 15 &quot; Therefore when you see the `abomination of desolation,'
  spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place&quot; (whoever reads, let him
  understand), 16 &quot;then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17 &quot;Let
  him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. 18 &quot;And let
  him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. 19 &quot;But woe to those who are
  pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 20 &quot;And pray that your
  flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. 21 &quot;For then there will be great
  tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no,
  nor ever shall be. 22 &quot;And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved;
  but for the elect's sake those days will be shortened. 23 &quot;Then if anyone says to
  you, `Look, here [is] the Christ!' or `There!' do not believe [it]. 24 &quot;For false
  christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if
  possible, even the elect. 25 &quot;See, I have told you beforehand. 26 &quot;Therefore if
  they say to you, `Look, He is in the desert!' do not go out; [or] `Look, [He] [is] in the
  inner rooms!' do not believe [it]. 27 &quot;For as the lightning comes from the east and
  flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 28 &quot;For wherever
  the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together. 29 &quot; Immediately after
  the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its
  light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30
  &quot;Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of
  the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with
  power and great glory. 31 &quot;And He will send His angels with a great sound of a
  trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of
  heaven to the other.<br>
