  <p><i>John 14:26</i>  
  <p>26 &quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.<br>
  <p><i>1 Cor. 2:9-16</i></font>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 &nbsp; But as it is written: &quot;Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the
  heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.&quot; 10 But God
  has revealed [them] to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the
  deep things of God. 11 For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man
  which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. 12 Now
  we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we
  might know the things that have been freely given to us by God. 13 These things we also
  speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches,
  comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 14 But the natural man does not receive the
  things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know [them],
  because they are spiritually discerned. 15 But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet
  he himself is [rightly] judged by no one. 16 For &quot;who has known the mind of the Lord
  that he may instruct Him?&quot; But we have the mind of Christ.<br>
