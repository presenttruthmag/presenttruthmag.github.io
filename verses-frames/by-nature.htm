  <p><i>Psalm 51:5</i>  
  <p>5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And <strong>in sin my mother conceived me . </strong><br>
  <p><i>Eph. 2:1-3</i>  
  <p>2:1 And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins, 2 in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, 3 among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were <strong>by nature </strong>children of wrath, just as the others.<br>
  <p><i>1 Cor. 2:14</i>  
  <p>14 But the<strong> natural man</strong> does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned. <br>
  <p><i>James 5:17</i>  
  <p>17 Elijah was a man with <strong>a nature </strong>like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months.<br>
  <p><i>Rom. 7:14</i>  
  <p>14 For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am <strong>carnal</strong>, sold under sin. <br>
  <p><i>Rom. 8:7</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Because the <strong>carnal mind</strong> is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. <br>
