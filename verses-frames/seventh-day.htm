<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished. 2 And on the
seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from
all His work which He had done. 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it,
because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.<br>
