  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 To the woman he said, &quot;I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.&quot; 17 To Adam he said, &quot;Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, `You must not eat of it,' &quot;Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. 18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. 19 By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.&quot;<br>
