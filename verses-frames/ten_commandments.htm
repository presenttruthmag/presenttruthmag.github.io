    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Ex 20:3-17</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 &quot;You shall have no other gods before Me.<br>
  4 &quot;You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth;<br>

5 you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,<br>

6 but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.<br>
7 &quot;You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.<br>
8 &quot;Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>

9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,<br>

10 but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates.<br>

11 For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.<br>
12 &quot;Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God is giving you.<br>
13 &quot;You shall not murder.<br>
14 &quot;You shall not commit adultery.<br>
15 &quot;You shall not steal.<br>
16 &quot;You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.<br>
17 &quot;You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.&quot;<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt 5:17-29</i> </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 &quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. 18 &quot;For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. 19 &quot;Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 &quot;For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. 21 &quot;You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.' 22 &quot;But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Raca!' shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, 'You fool!' shall be in danger of hell fire. 23 &quot;Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, 24 &quot;leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. 25 &quot;Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. 26 &quot;Assuredly, I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny. 27 &quot;You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not commit adultery.' 28 &quot;But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 &quot;If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt 15:3-9</i> </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 He answered and said to them, &quot;Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 4 &quot;For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.' 5 &quot;But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, &quot;Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God&quot;-- 6 'then he need not honor his father or mother.' Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. 7 &quot;Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: 8 'These people draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with their lips, But their heart is far from Me. 9 And in vain they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.' &quot;<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt 22:36-40</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">36 &quot;Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?&quot; 37 Jesus said to him, &quot; 'You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.' 38 &quot;This is the first and great commandment. 39 &quot;And the second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' 40 &quot;On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.&quot;<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom 13:8-10</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. 9 For the commandments, &quot;You shall not commit adultery,&quot; &quot;You shall not murder,&quot; &quot;You shall not steal,&quot; &quot;You shall not bear false witness,&quot; &quot;You shall not covet,&quot; and if there is any other commandment, are all summed up in this saying, namely, &quot;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; 10 Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1Cor 7:19</i> </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is what matters.<br>



  </font>
<p>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 John 2:3-6,15-17</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. 4 He who says, &quot;I know Him,&quot; and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. 6 He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.
