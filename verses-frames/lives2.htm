    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor 5:14-15,17</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; 15 and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again. 17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor 7:1</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
