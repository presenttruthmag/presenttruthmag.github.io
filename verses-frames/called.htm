  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all
  creation. 16 For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth,
  visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All
  things were created through Him and for Him. 17 And He is before all things, and in Him
  all things consist.</font><br>
