things [are] just, whatever things [are] pure, whatever things [are] lovely, whatever
things [are] of good report, if [there] [is] any virtue and if [there] [is] anything
praiseworthy--meditate on these things. 9 The things which you learned and received and
heard and saw in me, these do, and the God of peace will be with you.<br>
