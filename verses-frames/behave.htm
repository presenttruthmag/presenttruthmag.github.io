<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and rest your hope fully upon
the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 14 as obedient
children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, as in your ignorance; 15 but as
He who called you is holy, <strong>you also be holy in all your conduct</strong>, 16 because it is
written, &quot;Be holy, for I am holy.&quot; 17 And if you call on the Father, who without
partiality judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves throughout the time of
your stay here in fear;</font><br>
