  <p><i>John 5:25-29</i>  
  <p>25 &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead
  will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live. 26 &quot;For as the
  Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself, 27
  &quot;and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man.
  28 &quot;Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves
  will hear His voice 29 &quot;and come forth--those who have done good, to the resurrection
  of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.<br>

  <p><i>John 11:24-25</i>  
  <p>24 Martha said to Him, &quot;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the
  last day.&quot; 25 Jesus said to her, &quot;I am the resurrection and the life. He who
  believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.<br>

  <p><i>1 Cor. 15:12-28</i>  
  <p>12 Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among
  you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 But if there is no resurrection of
  the dead, then Christ is not risen. 14 And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching [is]
  empty and your faith [is] also empty. 15 Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God,
  because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up--if in
  fact the dead do not rise. 16 For if [the] dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen. 17
  And if Christ is not risen, your faith [is] futile; you are still in your sins! 18 Then
  also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 19 If in this life only we have
  hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable. 20 But now Christ is risen from the
  dead, [and] has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 21 For since by
  man [came] death, by Man also [came] the resurrection of the dead. 22 For as in Adam all
  die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive. 23 But each one in his own order: Christ
  the firstfruits, afterward those [who] [are] Christ's at His coming. 24 Then [comes] the
  end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and
  all authority and power. 25 For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet.
  26 The last enemy [that] will be destroyed [is] death. 27 For &quot;He has put all things
  under His feet.&quot; But when He says &quot;all things are put under [Him],&quot; [it]
  [is] evident that He who put all things under Him is excepted. 28 Now when all things are
  made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things
  under Him, that God may be all in all.<br>

  <p><i>1 Th. 4:13-18</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen
  asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus died
  and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus. 15 For this we
  say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive [and] remain until the coming of
  the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. 16 For the Lord Himself will
  descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of
  God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive [and] remain shall
  be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we
  shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.<br>
