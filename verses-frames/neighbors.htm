  <p><i>Rom. 13:8-10</i>  
  <p>8 Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. 9 For the commandments, &quot;You shall not commit adultery,&quot; &quot;You shall not murder,&quot; &quot;You shall not steal,&quot; &quot;You shall not bear false witness,&quot; &quot;You shall not covet,&quot; and if [there] [is] any other commandment, are [all] summed up in this saying, namely, &quot;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; 10 Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love [is] the fulfillment of the law.<br>
