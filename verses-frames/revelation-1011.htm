  <p>1 (NKJV) I saw still another mighty
  angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow [was] on his head, his
  face [was] like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.   
  <p>2 He had a little book open in his
  hand. And he set his right foot on the sea and [his] left [foot] on the land,   
  <p>3 and cried with a loud voice, as
  [when] a lion roars. When he cried out, seven thunders uttered their voices.   
  <p>4 Now when the seven thunders
  uttered their voices, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, &quot;Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and do not write them.&quot;   
  <p>5 The angel whom I saw standing on
  the sea and on the land raised up his hand to heaven   
  <p>6 and swore by Him who lives forever
  and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that
  are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there should be delay no
  longer,   
  <p>7 but in the days of the sounding of
  the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God would be finished, as He
  declared to His servants the prophets.   
  <p>8 Then the voice which I heard from
  heaven spoke to me again and said, &quot;Go, take the little book which is open in the
  hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth.&quot;   
  <p>9 So I went to the angel and said to
  him, &quot;Give me the little book.&quot; And he said to me, &quot;Take and eat it; and it
  will make your stomach bitter, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.&quot; <br>
  
  <p>10 Then I took the little book out
  of the angel's hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. But when I had
  eaten it, my stomach became bitter.   
  <p>11 And he said to me, &quot;You must
  prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings.&quot;  </font>

  <p>1 Then I was given a reed like a
    measuring rod. And the angel stood, saying, &quot;Rise and measure the temple of God, the
  altar, and those who worship there.   
  <p>2 &quot;But leave out the court
    which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles.
  And they will tread the holy city underfoot [for] forty-two months.   
  <p>3 &quot;And I will give [power] to
  my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed
  in sackcloth.&quot;   
  <p>4 These are the two olive trees and
  the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.   
  <p>5 And if anyone wants to harm them,
  fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone wants to harm
  them, he must be killed in this manner.   
  <p>6 These have power to shut heaven,
  so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy; and they have power over waters to
  turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they desire.   
  <p>7 When they finish their testimony,
  the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them, overcome
  them, and kill them.   
  <p>8 And their dead bodies [will] [lie]
  in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also
  our Lord was crucified.   
  <p>9 Then [those] from the peoples,
  tribes, tongues, and nations will see their dead bodies three-and-a-half days, and not
  allow their dead bodies to be put into graves.   
  <p>10 And those who dwell on the earth
  will rejoice over them, make merry, and send gifts to one another, because these two
  prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.   
  <p>11 Now after the three-and-a-half
  days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and great
  fear fell on those who saw them.   
  <p>12 And they heard a loud voice from
  heaven saying to them, &quot;Come up here.&quot; And they ascended to heaven in a cloud,
  and their enemies saw them.   
  <p>13 In the same hour there was a
  great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. In the earthquake seven thousand people
  were killed, and the rest were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven.   
  <p>14 The second woe is past. Behold,
  the third woe is coming quickly.   
  <p>15 Then the seventh angel sounded:
  And there were loud voices in heaven, saying, &quot;The kingdoms of this world have become
  [the] [kingdoms] of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!&quot;
  <p>16 And the twenty-four elders who
  sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God,   
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 saying: &quot;We give You thanks, O Lord God
    Almighty, The One who is and who was and who
  is to come, Because You have taken Your great
  power and reigned. </font>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p>18 The nations were angry, and Your
  wrath has come, And the time of the dead, that they
  should be judged, And that You should reward Your
  servants the prophets and the saints, And those who fear Your name, small
  and great, And should destroy those who destroy
    the earth.&quot; </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 Then the temple of God was opened
in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple. And there were lightnings,
noises, thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail.<br>
