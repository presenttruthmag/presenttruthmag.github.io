  <p><i>1 Cor. 2:14</i>  
  <p>14 But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned.<br>

  <p><i>Eph. 2:3</i>  
  <p>3 among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others.<br>

  <p><i>James 1:23</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;<br>
