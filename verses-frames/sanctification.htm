  <p><i>1 Th. 4:8-12</i>  
  <p>8 Therefore he who rejects [this] does not reject man, but God, who has also given us His Holy Spirit. 9 But concerning brotherly love you have no need that I should write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another; 10 and indeed you do so toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, that you increase more and more; 11 that you also aspire to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you, 12 that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and [that] you may lack nothing.<br>

  <p><i>2 Cor. 7:1</i>  
  <p>1 Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.<br>

  <p><i>Titus 3:8, 14</i>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men. . . . .14 And let our [people] also learn to maintain good works, to [meet] urgent needs, that they may not be unfruitful.<br>
