<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 &quot; And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to
pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen
by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. 6 &quot;But you, when you pray,
go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who [is] in the
secret [place]; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. 7 &quot;And
when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen [do]. For they think that they
will be heard for their many words. 8 &quot;Therefore do not be like them. For your Father
knows the things you have need of before you ask Him. 9 &quot;In this manner, therefore,
pray: Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name. 10 Your kingdom come. Your will be done
On earth as [it] [is] in heaven. 11 Give us this day our daily bread. 12 And forgive us
our debts, As we forgive our debtors. 13 And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver
us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. </font>
