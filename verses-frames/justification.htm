  <p><i>Luke 18:9-14</i>   
  <P>9 Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that
  they were righteous, and despised others: 10 &quot;Two men went up to the temple to pray,
  one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 &quot;The Pharisee stood and prayed thus
  with himself, `God, I thank You that I am not like other men--extortioners, unjust,
  adulterers, or even as this tax collector. 12 `I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all
  that I possess.' 13 &quot;And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as
  raise [his] eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, `God, be merciful to me a
  sinner!' 14 &quot;I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the
  other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be
  exalted.&quot;<br>

  1 Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God
  through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom also we have access by faith into this grace
  in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God....6 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. 8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 &quot;knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</br>
