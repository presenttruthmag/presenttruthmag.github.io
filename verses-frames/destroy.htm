  <p><i>Matt. 21:43, 44</i>  
  <p>43 &quot;Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to
  a nation bearing the fruits of it. 44 &quot;And whoever falls on this stone will be
  broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.&quot;<br>

  <p><i>Luke 17:29-30</i>  
  <p>29 &quot;but on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
  heaven and destroyed [them] all. 30 &quot;Even so will it be in the day when the Son of
  Man is revealed.<br>

  <p><i>1 Cor. 15:26</i>  
  <p>26 The last enemy [that] will be destroyed [is] death.<br>

  <p><i>Jude 5-19</i>  
  <p>5 But I want to remind you, though you once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the
  people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. 6 And the
  angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in
  everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day; 7 as Sodom and
  Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves
  over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example,
  suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. 8 Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh,
  reject authority, and speak evil of dignitaries. 9 Yet Michael the archangel, in
  contending with the devil, when he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring
  against him a reviling accusation, but said, &quot;The Lord rebuke you!&quot; 10 But these
  speak evil of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know naturally, like brute
  beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves. 11 Woe to them! For they have gone in the
  way of Cain, have run greedily in the error of Balaam for profit, and perished in the
  rebellion of Korah. 12 These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast with you
  without fear, serving [only] themselves. [They] [are] clouds without water, carried about
  by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots; 13
  raging waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars for whom is reserved
  the blackness of darkness forever. 14 Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about
  these men also, saying, &quot;Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, 15
  &quot;to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their
  ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things
  which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.&quot; 16 These are grumblers, complainers,
  walking according to their own lusts; and they mouth great swelling [words], flattering
  people to gain advantage. 17 But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before
  by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ: 18 how they told you that there would be mockers
  in the last time who would walk according to their own ungodly lusts. 19 These are sensual
  persons, who cause divisions, not having the Spirit.<br>

  <p><i>2 Pet. 2:12</i>   
  <p>12 But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of
  the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in their own corruption,<br>

  <p><i>2 Th. 2:8</i>  
  <p>8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath
  of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming.<br>

  <p><i>Jam. 4:12</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you to judge
  another?<br>
