  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 Nevertheless, the Lord raised up judges who delivered them
  out of the hand of those who plundered them. 17 Yet they would not listen to their judges,
  but they played the harlot with other gods, and bowed down to them. They turned quickly
  from the way in which their fathers walked, in obeying the commandments of the Lord; they
  did not do so. 18 And when the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge
  and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the
  Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed them and harassed
  them.</font><br>
