  <p><i>Phil. 3:10-14</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, 11 if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. 12 Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but<strong> I press on</strong>, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me. 13 Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, 14 I <strong>press toward the goal </strong>for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.<br>
