  <p><i>Rom. 6:22</i>  
  <P>22 But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of
  God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life.<br>

  <p><i>Gal. 5:22-25</i>   
  <P>22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no
  law. 24 And those [who] [are] Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and
  desires. 25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.<br>

  <p><i>Titus 2:14</i>   
  <P>14 who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every
  lawless deed and purify for Himself [His] own special people, zealous for good works.<br>

  <p><i>Titus 3:8</i>   
  <P>8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm
  constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works.
  These things are good and profitable to men.<br>

  <p><i>Heb. 10:24</i> </font>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">24 And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good
  works.<br>
