  <p><i>Heb. 1:2,3</i></br>
  <p>2 but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all
  things, and through whom he made the universe. 3 The Son is the radiance of God's glory
  and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.
  After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty
  in heaven.</br>
