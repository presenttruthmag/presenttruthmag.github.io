  <p><i>John 14:15-17</i>  
  <P>15 &quot; If you love Me, keep My commandments. 16 &quot;And I
  will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you
  forever-- 17 &quot;the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither
  sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you.<br>

  <p><i>1 Cor. 3:16</i>  
  <P>16 Do you not know that you are the temple of God and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?<br>

  <p><i>Eph. 5:18</i></font>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 And do not be drunk with wine, in which is  dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit.<br>
