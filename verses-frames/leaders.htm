  <p><I>1 Tim. 3:1-7</I>  
  <p>1 This [is] a faithful saying: If a man desires the position of a bishop, he desires a
  good work. 2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate,
  sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach; 3 not given to wine, not
  violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous; 4 one who rules
  his own house well, having [his] children in submission with all reverence 5 (for if a man
  does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?); 6
  not a novice, lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the [same] condemnation as the
  devil. 7 Moreover he must have a good testimony among those who are outside, lest he fall
  into reproach and the snare of the devil.<br>
