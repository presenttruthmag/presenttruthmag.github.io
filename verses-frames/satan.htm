  <p><i>Job 1:1-12</i>  
  <p>:1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name [was] Job; and that man was blameless
  and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil. 2 And seven sons and three daughters
  were born to him. 3 Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand
  camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large
  household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East. 4 And his sons
  would go and feast [in] [their] houses, each on his [appointed] day, and would send and
  invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 5 So it was, when the days of
  feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise
  early in the morning and offer burnt offerings [according] [to] the number of them all.
  For Job said, &quot;It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their
  hearts.&quot; Thus Job did regularly. 6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to
  present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them. 7 And the Lord said to
  Satan, &quot;From where do you come?&quot; So Satan answered the Lord and said, &quot;From
  going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.&quot; 8 Then the
  Lord said to Satan, &quot;Have you considered My servant Job, that [there] [is] none like
  him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?&quot; 9
  So Satan answered the Lord and said, &quot;Does Job fear God for nothing? 10 &quot;Have
  You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every
  side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the
  land. 11 &quot;But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will
  surely curse You to Your face!&quot; 12 And the Lord said to Satan, &quot;Behold, all that
  he has [is] in your power; only do not lay a hand on his [person].&quot; So Satan went out
  from the presence of the Lord.<br>

  <p><I>Matt. 4:1-11</I>  
  <p>1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 2
  And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry. 3 Now when
  the tempter came to Him, he said, &quot;If You are the Son of God, command that these
  stones become bread.&quot; 4 But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, `Man shall not
  live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.' &quot; 5 Then
  the devil took Him up into the holy city, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, 6 and
  said to Him, &quot;If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: `He
  shall give His angels charge over you,' and, `In [their] hands they shall bear you up,
  Lest you dash your foot against a stone.' &quot; 7 Jesus said to him, &quot;It is written
  again, `You shall not tempt the Lord your God.' &quot; 8 Again, the devil took Him up on
  an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their
  glory. 9 And he said to Him, &quot;All these things I will give You if You will fall down
  and worship me.&quot; 10 Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Away with you, Satan! For it is
  written, `You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.' &quot; 11
  Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.<br>
  
  <p><I>Matt. 13:39</I>  
  <p>39 &quot;The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and
    the reapers are the angels.<br>
    
<p><I>Matt.25:41</I>
<p>41 &quot;Then He will also say to those on the left hand, `Depart from Me, you cursed,
    into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels:<br>
    
<p><I>John 8:44</I>
<p>44 &quot;You are of [your] father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to
    do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and [does] [not] stand in the truth, because
    there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own [resources], for he
    is a liar and the father of it.<br>
    
<p><I>Eph. 4:27</I>
<p>27 nor give place to the devil.<br>

  <p><I>Eph. 6:11</I>  
  <p>11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of
  the devil.<br>
  
  <p><i>Rom. 16:20</i>  
  <p>20 And the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord
  Jesus Christ [be] with you. Amen.<br>

  <p><I>Heb. 2:14</I>  
  <p>14 Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise
  shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death,
  that is, the devil,<br>
  
  <p><I>James 4:7</I>  
  <p>7 Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.<br>

  <p><I>1 Pet. 5:8</I>  
  <p>8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring
  lion, seeking whom he may devour.<br>
  
  <p><I>1 John 3:8-10</I>  
  <p>8 He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this
  purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. 9
  Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin,
  because he has been born of God. 10 In this the children of God and the children of the
  devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor [is] he who
  does not love his brother.<br>
  
  <p><i>Rev. 20:10</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the
  beast and the false prophet [are]. And they will be tormented day and night forever and
  ever.<br>
