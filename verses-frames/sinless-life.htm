  <p><i>Heb. 4:15</i>  
  <p>15 For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was
  in all [points] tempted as [we] [are], [yet] without sin.<br>

  <p><i>Heb. 9:14</i>  
  <p>14 how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered
  Himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living
  God?<br>

  <p><i>John 8:46</i>  
  <p>46 &quot;Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not
      believe Me?<br>
    
<p><i>1 Pet. 1:19</i>
<p>19 but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without
  spot.<br>

  <p><i>1 Pet. 2:22</i>  
  <p>22 &quot;Who committed no sin, Nor was deceit found in His mouth&quot;;<br>

  <p><i>2 Cor. 5:21</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 For He made Him who knew no sin [to] [be] sin for us, that we might become the
  righteousness of God in Him.<br>
