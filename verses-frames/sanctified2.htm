For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. <br>

16 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man,&nbsp; 17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what [is] the width and length and depth and height&#8212;19 to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. <br>

1 I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to walk worthy of the calling with which you were called, <br>
2 with all lowliness and gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love, &nbsp; 3 endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. . . . . 17 This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind, <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

1 Therefore if [there is] any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy, <br>

2 fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, [being] of one accord, of one mind. <br>

3 [Let] nothing [be done] through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. <br>

4 Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others. <br>
