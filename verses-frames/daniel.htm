It was God through the angel Gabriel who gave these visions to Daniel and so it was only fitting that when God finally unsealed the hidden meaning of the visions it was through the announcement again by the angel Gabriel in Luke 1: 26-32 </font></p>
 <blockquote>
   <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</font></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Daniel's prophecy ends with the precious promise to all who put their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ that with Daniel they shall rest and finally stand in their lot at the end of the days. Even so, come Lord Jesus.</font></p>
