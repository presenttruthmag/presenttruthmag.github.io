  <p><i>Dan. 9:25-26</i>  
  <p>25 &quot;Know therefore and understand, That from the going forth of the command To
  restore and build Jerusalem Until <strong>Messiah</strong> the Prince, There shall be seven weeks and
  sixty-two weeks; The street shall be built again, and the wall, Even in troublesome times.
  26 &quot;And after the sixty-two weeks <strong>Messiah</strong> shall be cut off, but not for Himself; And
  the people of the prince who is to come Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end
  of it shall be with a flood, And till the end of the war desolations are determined.<br>
  <p><i>John 4:25-26, 42</i>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 The woman said to Him, &quot;I know that <strong>Messiah</strong> is coming&quot; (who is called
      <strong>Christ</strong>). &quot;When He comes, He will tell us all things.&quot; 26 Jesus said to her,
  &quot;I who speak to you am He.&quot; . . . . 42 Then they said to the woman, &quot;Now we believe, not because of what you said, for
  we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the <strong>Christ</strong>, the Savior of
  the world.&quot;<br>
