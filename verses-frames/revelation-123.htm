  <p>1</b>:1 (NKJV) The
  Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants--things which must
  shortly take place. And He sent and signified [it] by His angel to His servant John,   
  <p>2 who bore witness to the word of
  God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all things that he saw.   
  <p>3 Blessed [is] he who reads and
  those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it;
  for the time [is] near.   
  <p>4 John, to the seven churches which
  are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who
  was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,   
  <p>5 and from Jesus Christ, the
  faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth.
  To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,   
  <p>6 and has made us kings and priests
  to His God and Father, to Him [be] glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.   
  <p>7 Behold, He is coming with clouds,
  and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth
  will mourn because of Him. Even so, Amen.   
  <p>8 &quot;I am the Alpha and the
  Omega, [the] Beginning and [the] End,&quot; says the Lord, &quot;who is and who was and
  who is to come, the Almighty.&quot;   
  <p>9 I, John, both your brother and
  companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the island
  that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.   
  <p>10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's
  Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet,   
  <p>11 saying, &quot;I am the Alpha and
  the Omega, the First and the Last,&quot; and, &quot;What you see, write in a book and send
  [it] to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to
  Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.&quot;   
  <p>12 Then I turned to see the voice
  that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands,   
  <p>13 and in the midst of the seven
  lampstands [One] like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded
  about the chest with a golden band.   
  <p>14 His head and hair [were] white
  like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire;   
  <p>15 His feet [were] like fine brass,
  as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters;   
  <p>16 He had in His right hand seven
  stars, out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance [was] like the
  sun shining in its strength.   
  <p>17 And when I saw Him, I fell at His
    feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, &quot;Do not be afraid; I am
  the First and the Last.   
  <p>18 &quot;I [am] He who lives, and
    was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of
  Death.  
  <p> 19 &quot;Write the things which you
  have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after this.   
  <p>20 &quot;The mystery of the seven
  stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are
  the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven
  churches.  </font>

  <p>2</b>:1 &quot;To the
  angel of the church of Ephesus write, `These things says He
  who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden
  lampstands:   
  <p>2 &quot;I know your works, your
    labor, your patience, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. And you have tested
  those who say they are apostles and are not, and have found them liars;   
  <p>3 &quot;and you have persevered and
  have patience, and have labored for My name's sake and have not become weary.   
  <p>4 &quot;Nevertheless I have [this]
  against you, that you have left your first love.   
  <p>5 &quot;Remember therefore from
    where you have fallen; repent and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly
  and remove your lampstand from its place--unless you repent.   
  <p>6 &quot;But this you have, that you
  hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.   
  <p>7 &quot;He who has an ear, let him
  hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat from
  the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.&quot; '   
  <p>8 &quot; And
    to the angel of the church in Smyrna write, `These things says the First and the Last, who
  was dead, and came to life:   
  <p>9 &quot;I know your works,
    tribulation, and poverty (but you are rich); and [I] [know] the blasphemy of those who say
  they are Jews and are not, but [are] a synagogue of Satan.   
  <p>10 &quot;Do not fear any of those
    things which you are about to suffer. Indeed, the devil is about to throw [some] of you
    into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful
  until death, and I will give you the crown of life.   
  <p>11 &quot;He who has an ear, let him
  hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the
  second death.&quot; '   
  <p>12 &quot; And
    to the angel of the church in Pergamos write, `These things says He who has the sharp
  two-edged sword:   
  <p>13 &quot;I know your works, and
    where you dwell, where Satan's throne [is]. And you hold fast to My name, and did not deny
    My faith even in the days in which Antipas [was] My faithful martyr, who was killed among
  you, where Satan dwells.   
  <p>14 &quot;But I have a few things
    against you, because you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught
    Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to
  idols, and to commit sexual immorality.   
  <p>15 &quot;Thus you also have those
  who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.   
  <p>16 `Repent, or else I will come to
  you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth.   
  <p>17 &quot;He who has an ear, let him
  hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give some of the
  hidden manna to eat. And I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name
  written which no one knows except him who receives [it].&quot; '   
  <p>18 &quot; And
    to the angel of the church in Thyatira write, `These things says the Son of God, who has
  eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass:   
  <p>19 &quot;I know your works, love,
    service, faith, and your patience; and [as] for your works, the last [are] more than the
  first.   
  <p>20 &quot;Nevertheless I have a few
    things against you, because you allow that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess,
    to teach and seduce My servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to
  idols.   
  <p>21 &quot;And I gave her time to
  repent of her sexual immorality, and she did not repent.   
  <p>22 &quot;Indeed I will cast her into
    a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they
  repent of their deeds.   
  <p>23 &quot;I will kill her children
    with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the minds and
  hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.   
  <p>24 &quot;Now to you I say, and to
    the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine, who have not known the depths
  of Satan, as they say, I will put on you no other burden.   
  <p>25 &quot;But hold fast what you have
  till I come.   
  <p>26 &quot;And he who overcomes, and
  keeps My works until the end, to him I will give power over the nations-
  <p>27 `He shall rule them with a rod of
  iron; They shall be dashed to pieces like the potter's
  vessels'-- as I also have received from My Father;   
  <p>28 &quot;and I will give him the
  morning star.   
  <p>29 &quot;He who has an ear, let him
  hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&quot;&nbsp;  </font>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  <p>3</b>:1 &quot;And to
  the angel of the church in Sardis write, `These things says He
  who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: &quot;I know your works, that you
  have a name that you are alive, but you are dead.   
  <p>2 &quot;Be watchful, and strengthen
    the things which remain, that are ready to die, for I have not found your works perfect
  before God.   
  <p>3 &quot;Remember therefore how you
    have received and heard; hold fast and repent. Therefore if you will not watch, I will
  come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.   
  <p>4 &quot;You have a few names even in
    Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white, for they
  are worthy.   
  <p>5 &quot;He who overcomes shall be
    clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life; but I
  will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.   
  <p>6 &quot;He who has an ear, let him
  hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&quot; '   
  <p>7 &quot; And
  to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, `These things says He who is holy, He
  who is true, &quot;He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts, and shuts
  and no one opens&quot;:   
  <p>8 &quot;I know your works. See, I
    have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it; for you have a little strength,
  have kept My word, and have not denied My name.   
  <p>9 &quot;Indeed I will make [those]
    of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but lie--indeed I will make
  them come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.   
  <p>10 &quot;Because you have kept My
    command to persevere, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon
  the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.   
  <p>11 &quot;Behold, I am coming
  quickly! Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.   
  <p>12 &quot;He who overcomes, I will
    make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go out no more. And I will write
    on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which
  comes down out of heaven from My God. And [I] [will] [write] [on] [him] My new name.   
  <p>13 &quot;He who has an ear, let him
  hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&quot; '   
  <p>14 &quot; And
    to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, `These things says the Amen, the
  Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God:   
  <p>15 &quot;I know your works, that you
  are neither cold nor hot. I could wish you were cold or hot.   
  <p>16 &quot;So then, because you are
  lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth.   
  <p>17 &quot;Because you say, `I am
    rich, have become wealthy, and have need of nothing'--and do not know that you are
  wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked--   
  <p>18 &quot;I counsel you to buy from
    Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be
    clothed, [that] the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with
  eye salve, that you may see.   
  <p>19 &quot;As many as I love, I rebuke
  and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent.   
  <p>20 &quot;Behold, I stand at the door
    and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine
  with him, and he with Me.   
  <p>21 &quot;To him who overcomes I will
    grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His
  throne.
