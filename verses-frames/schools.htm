  <p><I>Deute. 4:9-10</I>  
  <p>9 &quot; Only take heed to yourself, and diligently keep yourself, lest you forget the
  things your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your
  life. And teach them to your children and your grandchildren, 10 &quot;[especially]
  [concerning] the day you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, when the Lord said to
  me, `Gather the people to Me, and I will let them hear My words, that they may learn to
  fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and [that] they may teach their children.'<br>
  
  <p><I>Deute. 6:4-9</I>  
  <p>4 &quot; Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord [is] one! 5 &quot;You shall love
  the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. 6
&quot; And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. 7 &quot;You shall
  teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house,
  when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. 8 &quot;You shall bind
  them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. 9 &quot;You
  shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.<br>
  
  <p><I>Deute. 11:18-21</I>  
  <p>18 &quot; Therefore you shall lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your
  soul, and bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your
  eyes. 19 &quot;You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in
  your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. 20
&quot;And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, 21
&quot;that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land of which
  the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, like the days of the heavens above the earth.<br>
  
  <p><I>Ps. 25:4-5, 8-9</I>  
  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 Show me Your ways, O Lord; Teach me Your paths. 5 Lead me in Your truth and teach me,
  For You [are] the God of my salvation; On You I wait all the day. 8 Good and upright [is] the Lord; Therefore He teaches sinners in the way. 9 The humble
  He guides in justice, And the humble He teaches His way.<br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><I>Prov. 9:9-10</I>  
  <p>9 Give [instruction] to a wise [man], and he will be still wiser; Teach a just [man],
    and he will increase in learning. 10 &quot;The fear of the Lord [is] the beginning of
    wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One [is] understanding.<br>
    
<p><I>Matt. 5:19</I></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 &quot;Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches
men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches
[them], he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br>
