<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">53 &quot;Are You greater than our father Abraham, who is dead?
    And the prophets are dead. Whom do You make Yourself out to be?&quot; 54 Jesus answered,
  &quot;If I honor Myself, My honor is nothing. It is My Father who honors Me, of whom you
    say that He is your God. 55 &quot;Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I
    say, `I do not know Him,' I shall be a liar like you; but I do know Him and keep His word.
    56 &quot;Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw [it] and was glad.&quot;
  57 Then the Jews said to Him, &quot;You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen
    Abraham?&quot; 58 Jesus said to them, &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham
    was, I AM.&quot; 59 Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself and
    went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.<br>

  13 Then Moses said to God, &quot;Indeed, [when] I come to the children of Israel and say
  to them, `The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they say to me, `What [is] His
  name?' what shall I say to them?&quot; 14 And God said to Moses, &quot;I AM WHO I
  AM.&quot; And He said, &quot;Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, `I AM has sent
  me to you.' &quot;<br>
