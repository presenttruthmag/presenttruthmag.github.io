  <p><i>1 Cor. 6:2, 3</i>  
  <p>2 Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged
  by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Do you not know that we shall
  judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life? <br>

  <p><i>2 Pet. 2:1-9</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false
  teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord
  who bought them, [and] bring on themselves swift destruction. 2 And many will follow their
  destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. 3 By covetousness
  they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been
  idle, and their destruction does not slumber. 4 For if God did not spare the angels who
  sinned, but cast [them] down to hell and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be
  reserved for judgment; 5 and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, [one] [of]
  eight [people], a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the
  ungodly; 6 and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned [them] to
  destruction, making [them] an example to those who afterward would live ungodly; 7 and
  delivered righteous Lot, [who] [was] oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked 8 (for
  that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented [his] righteous soul from day to day by
  seeing and hearing [their] lawless deeds)-- 9 [then] the Lord knows how to deliver the
  godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of
  judgment,<br>
