  <p><i>Heb 9:28</i>  
  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">28 so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.<br>



  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><i>John 11:47-52</i>  
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, &quot;What shall we do? For this Man works many signs. 48 &quot;If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.&quot; 49 And one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, &quot;You know nothing at all, 50 &quot;nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.&quot; 51 Now this he did not say on his own authority; but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, 52 and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.<br>



</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><i>Romans 5:10</i>  
  <p>For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.<br>



  <p><i>Col 1:20-21</i>  
  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross. 21 And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled<br>
    

    
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><i>2 Cor 5:18-19</i>
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, 19 that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.<br>
    

    
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><i>Heb 2:17</i>
<p>Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.<br>



<p><i>Gal 3:13</i>  
<p>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, &quot;Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree&quot;),<br>



<p><i>Gal 4:4-5</i>  
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, 5 to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.<br>
    

    
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><i>Titus 2:14</i>
<p>...who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself His own special people, zealous for good works.<br>



<p><i>Eph 1:6-7</i>  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He has made us accepted in the Beloved. 7 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace<br>
