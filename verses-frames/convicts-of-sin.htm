  </i>7 &quot;Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for
  if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to
  you. 8 &quot;And when He has come, He will <strong>convict the world of sin</strong>, and of righteousness,
  and of judgment: 9 &quot;of sin, because they do not believe in Me; 10 &quot;of
  righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more; 11 &quot;of judgment,
  because the ruler of this world is judged.<br>

  16 I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. 17 For
  the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are
  contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. 18 But if you are
  led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 19 Now the works of the flesh are evident,
  which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, 20 idolatry, sorcery, hatred,
  contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, 21
  envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just
  as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit
  the kingdom of God.<br>
