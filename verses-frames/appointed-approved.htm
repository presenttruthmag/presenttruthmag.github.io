  <p><I>Titus 1:5-9</I>  
  <p>5 For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are
  lacking, and <strong>appoint</strong> elders in every city as I commanded you&#8212; 6 if a man is <strong>blameless</strong>,
  the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of dissipation or
  insubordination. 7 For a bishop must be <strong>blameless</strong>, as a steward of God, not self-willed,
  not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, 8 but
  hospitable, a lover of what is good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled, 9 holding
  fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both
  to exhort and convict those who contradict.<br>
  <p><I>1 Tim. 5:17</I></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 Let the <strong>elders who rule</strong> well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who
labor in the word and doctrine.</font><br>
