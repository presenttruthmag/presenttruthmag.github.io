    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Romans 5:5-8</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.<br>

6 For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.<br>

7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die.<br>

8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Isaiah 53:8-9</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 He was taken from prison and from judgment, And who will declare His generation? For He was cut off from the land of the living; For the transgressions of My people He was stricken.<br>

9 And they made His grave with the wicked--But with the rich at His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was any deceit in His mouth.<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 John 3:4</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Romans 3:20</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
