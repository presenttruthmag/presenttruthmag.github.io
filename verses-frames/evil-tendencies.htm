  <p><i>Rom. 3:10-19</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 As it is written: &quot;There is none righteous, no, not one; 11 There is none who understands; There is none who seeks after God. 12 They have all turned aside; They have together become unprofitable; There is none who does good, no, not one.&quot; 13 &quot;Their throat [is] an open tomb; With their tongues they have practiced deceit&quot;; &quot;The poison of asps [is] under their lips&quot;; 14 &quot;Whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness.&quot; 15 &quot;Their feet [are] swift to shed blood; 16 Destruction and misery [are] in their ways; 17 And the way of peace they have not known.&quot; 18 &quot;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&quot; 19 Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.<br>
