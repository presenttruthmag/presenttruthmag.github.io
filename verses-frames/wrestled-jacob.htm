  <p><i>Gen. 32:22-30</i>  
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 And he arose that night and took his two wives, his two
  female servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of Jabbok. 23 He took
  them, sent them over the brook, and sent over what he had. 24 Then Jacob was left alone;
  and a Man wrestled with him until the breaking of day. 25 Now when He saw that He did not
  prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob's hip was
  out of joint as He wrestled with him. 26 And He said, &quot;Let Me go, for the day
  breaks.&quot; But he said, &quot;I will not let You go unless You bless me!&quot; 27 So He
  said to him, &quot;What [is] your name?&quot; He said, &quot;Jacob.&quot; 28 And He said,
  &quot;Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with
  God and with men, and have prevailed.&quot; 29 Then Jacob asked, saying, &quot;Tell [me]
  Your name, I pray.&quot; And He said, &quot;Why [is] it [that] you ask about My
  name?&quot; And He blessed him there. 30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel:
  &quot;For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.&quot;<br>
