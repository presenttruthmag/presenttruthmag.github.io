  <p><I>Ezek. 28:11-19</I></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 12 &quot;Son of man, take up a
lamentation for the king of Tyre, and say to him, `Thus says the Lord God: &quot;You
were the seal of perfection, Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. 13 <strong>You were in Eden,
the garden of God</strong>; Every precious stone was your covering: The sardius, topaz, and
diamond, Beryl, onyx, and jasper, Sapphire, turquoise, and emerald with gold. The
workmanship of your timbrels and pipes Was prepared for you on the day you were created.
14 &quot;You were the anointed cherub who covers; I established you; You were on the
holy mountain of God; You walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones. 15 <strong>You
were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, Till iniquity was found in you</strong>.
16 &quot;By the abundance of your trading You became filled with violence within, And you
sinned; Therefore I cast you as a profane thing out of the mountain of God; And I
destroyed you, <strong>O covering cherub</strong>, From the midst of the fiery stones. 17 &quot;Your heart
was lifted up because of your beauty; You corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your
splendor; I cast you to the ground, I laid you before kings, That they might gaze at you.
18 &quot;You defiled your sanctuaries By the multitude of your iniquities, By the iniquity
of your trading; Therefore I brought fire from your midst; It devoured you, And I turned
you to ashes upon the earth In the sight of all who saw you. 19 All who knew you among the
peoples are astonished at you; You have become a horror, And shall be no more
forever.</font><br>
