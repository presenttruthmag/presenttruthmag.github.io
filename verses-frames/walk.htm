  <p><i>Gal 5:25</i>  
  <p>25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.<br>

  <p><i>Rom. 13:13</i>  
  <p>13 Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust, not in strife and envy. <br>

  <p><i>3 John 3, 4</i>  
  <p>3 For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified of the truth [that] [is] in you, just as you walk in the truth. 4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.<br>

  <p><i>2 John 4-6</i>  
  <p>4 I rejoiced greatly that I have found [some] of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father. 5 And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another. 6 This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.<br>

  <p><i>1 John 1:6-7</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.<br>
