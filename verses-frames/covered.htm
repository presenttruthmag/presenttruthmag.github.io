  </i>7 &quot;Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, And whose sins are <strong>covered</strong>; 8 Blessed is the man to whom the LORD shall not impute sin.&quot; 9 Does this blessedness then come upon the circumcised only, or upon the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.
