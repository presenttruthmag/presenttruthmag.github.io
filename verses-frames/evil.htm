  <p><i>1 Cor. 10:6</i>  
  <p>6 Now these things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted.<br>

  <p><i>3 John 11</i>  
  <p>11 Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God.<br>

  <p><i>1 Pet. 4:15</i>  
  <p>15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people's matters.<br>

  <p><i>1 Pet. 3:8-17</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Finally, all [of] [you] [be] of one mind, having compassion for one another; love as brothers, [be] tenderhearted, [be] courteous; 9 not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing. 10 For &quot;He who would love life And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips from speaking deceit. 11 Let him turn away from evil and do good; Let him seek peace and pursue it. 12 For the eyes of the Lord [are] on the righteous, And His ears [are] [open] to their prayers; But the face of the Lord [is] against those who do evil.&quot; 13 And who [is] he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good? 14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, [you] [are] blessed. &quot;And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.&quot; 15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always [be] ready to [give] a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; 16 having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed. 17 For [it] [is] better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.<br>
