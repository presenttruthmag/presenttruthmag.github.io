  <p><i>Ps. 130</i></br>
  <p>1 Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD; 2 O Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy. 3 If you, O LORD, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand? 4 But with you there is forgiveness; therefore you are feared. 5 I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in his word I put my hope. 6 My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning. 7 O Israel, put your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is unfailing love and with him is full redemption. 8 He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.</br>

  <p><i><br>
  Ps. 32</i></br>
  <p>1 Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. 2 Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit. 3 When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. 4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Selah 5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, &quot;I will confess my transgressions to the LORD&quot;-- and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah6 Therefore let everyone who is godly pray to you while you may be found; surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him. 7 You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah 8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you. 9 Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you. 10 Many are the woes of the wicked, but the LORD's unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in him. 11 Rejoice in the LORD and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart!</br>

  Rom. 3:20, 23</i></br>
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin. . . . 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</br>

  1 John 3:4</i></br>
  <p>4 Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.</br>

  <p><i><br>
  Rom. 7:7, 13</i></br>
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, &quot;Do not covet.&quot;</br>
  . . . . 13 Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.</br>
