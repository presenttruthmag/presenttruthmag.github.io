    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom 7:23</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I see another law in my members, <strong>warring</strong> against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor 10:3-6</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not <strong>war</strong> according to the flesh.

4 For the weapons of our <strong>warfare</strong> are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, 6 and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good <strong>warfare</strong>;<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Tim 2:3-7</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 4 No one engaged in <strong>warfare</strong> entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier. 5 And also if anyone competes in athletics, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 6 The hard-working farmer must be first to partake of the crops. 7 Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things. 8 Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel,<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Heb 12:4</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You have not yet <strong>resisted</strong> to bloodshed, striving against sin.
