  <p><I>1 John 2:15-17</I></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the
love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that [is] in the world--the lust of the
flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life&nbsp;&#8212; is not of the Father but is of the
world. 17 And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of
God abides forever.<br>
