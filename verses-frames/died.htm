  <p><i>Is. 53:8-9</i></br>
  <p>8 He was taken from prison and from judgment, And who will declare His generation? For He was cut off from the land of the living; For the transgressions of My people He was stricken. 9 And they made His grave with the wicked-- But with the rich at His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor [was] [any] deceit in His mouth.</br>
    <br>
  <p><i>Rom. 5:6-8</i></br>
  <p>6 For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. 8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</br>
    <br>
  <p><i>Rom. 8:34</i></br>
  <p>34 Who [is] he who condemns? [It] [is] Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.</br>
