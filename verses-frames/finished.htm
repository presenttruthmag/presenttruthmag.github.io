  <p><i>John 19:30</i>  
  <p>So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, &quot;It is finished!&quot; And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Heb 4:3-10</i><br>
  <br>
  3 For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said: &quot;So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest,' &quot; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.<br>
  4 For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: &quot;And God rested on the seventh day from all His works&quot;;<br>
  5 and again in this place: &quot;They shall not enter My rest.&quot;<br>

6 Since therefore it remains that some must enter it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience,<br>
7 again He designates a certain day, saying in David, &quot;Today,&quot; after such a long time, as it has been said: &quot;Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts.&quot;<br>

8 For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day.<br>

9 There remains therefore a rest for the people of God.<br>

10 For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.</font><br>
