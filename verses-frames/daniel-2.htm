  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 (NKJV) Now in the
        
second year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was [so]
        
troubled that his sleep left him.   
      </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 Then the king gave
        
the command to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to
        
tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. 
      </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 And the king said to
        
them, &quot;I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.&quot; 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 Then the Chaldeans
        
spoke to the king in Aramaic, &quot;O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream,
        
and we will give the interpretation.&quot; 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 The king answered
        
and said to the Chaldeans, &quot;My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream
        
to me, and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made
        
an ash heap. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 &quot;However, if
        
you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and
        
great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.&quot; 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 They answered again
        
and said, &quot;Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will give its
        
interpretation.&quot; 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 The king answered
        
and said, &quot;I know for certain that you would gain time, because you see that my
        
decision is firm: </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 &quot;if you do not
        
make known the dream to me, [there] [is] [only] one decree for you! For you have agreed to
        
speak lying and corrupt words before me till the time has changed. Therefore tell me the
        
dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.&quot; 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 The Chaldeans
        
answered the king, and said, &quot;There is not a man on earth who can tell the king's
        
matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has [ever] asked such things of any magician,
        
astrologer, or Chaldean. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 &quot;[It] [is] a
        
difficult thing that the king requests, and there is no other who can tell it to the king
        
except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.&quot; 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 For this reason the
        
king was angry and very furious, and gave a command to destroy all the wise [men] of
        
Babylon. 
      </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 So the decree went
        
out, and they began killing the wise [men]; and they sought Daniel and his companions, to
        
kill [them]. 
      </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Then with counsel
        
and wisdom Daniel answered Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, who had gone out to
        
kill the wise [men] of Babylon; 
      </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 he answered and
        
said to Arioch the king's captain, &quot;Why is the decree from the king so urgent?&quot; Then Arioch made the decision known to Daniel. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 So Daniel went in
        
and asked the king to give him time, that he might tell the king the interpretation. 
      </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 Then Daniel went to
        
his house, and made the decision known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, 
      </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 that they might
        
seek mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his
        
companions might not perish with the rest of the wise [men] of Babylon. 
      </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 Then the secret was
        
revealed to Daniel in a night vision. So Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 
      </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 Daniel answered and
        
said:&quot;Blessed be the
        
name of God forever and ever,For wisdom and might
        
are His. </font>    
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 And He changes the
    
times and the seasons; He removes kings and
    
raises up kings; He gives wisdom to the
    
wise &nbsp; And knowledge to those
    
who have understanding. <br>
<br>
22 He reveals deep and
    
secret things; &nbsp;He knows what [is] in
    
the darkness, &nbsp; And light dwells with
    
Him. </font>  
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 &quot;I thank You
    
and praise You, O God of my fathers; You have given me
    
wisdom and might, &nbsp; And have now made
    
known to me what we asked of You, &nbsp;For You have made
    
known to us the king's demand.&quot; 
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">24 Therefore Daniel
      
went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise [men] of Babylon. He went
      
and said thus to him: &quot;Do not destroy the wise [men] of Babylon; take me before the
      
king, and I will tell the king the interpretation.&quot; 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 Then Arioch quickly
      
brought Daniel before the king, and said thus to him, &quot;I have found a man of the
      
captives of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation.&quot; 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 The king answered
      
and said to Daniel, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, &quot;Are you able to make known to me
      
the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?&quot; 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">27 Daniel answered in
      
the presence of the king, and said, &quot;The secret which the king has demanded, the wise
      
[men], the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers cannot declare to the king. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">28 &quot;But there is
      
a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what
      
will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed, were
      
these: </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">29 &quot;As for you, O
      
king, thoughts came [to] your [mind] [while] on your bed, [about] what would come to pass
      
after this; and He who reveals secrets has made known to you what will be. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">30 &quot;But as for
      
me, this secret has not been revealed to me because I have more wisdom than anyone living,
      
but for [our] sakes who make known the interpretation to the king, and that you may know
      
the thoughts of your heart. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">31 &quot;You, O king,
      
were watching; and behold, a great image! This great image, whose splendor [was]
      
excellent, stood before you; and its form [was] awesome. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">32 &quot;This image's
      
head [was] of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">33 &quot;its legs of
      
iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">34 &quot;You watched
      
while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and
      
clay, and broke them in pieces. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">35 &quot;Then the
      
iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became
      
like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace
      
of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled
      
the whole earth. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">36 &quot;This [is] the
      
dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 &quot;You, O king,
      
[are] a king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and
      
glory; </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">38 &quot;and wherever
      
the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven, He has
      
given [them] into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all--you [are] this head of
      
gold. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">39 &quot;But after you
      
shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another, a third kingdom of bronze,
      
which shall rule over all the earth. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">40 &quot;And the
      
fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters
      
everything; and like iron that crushes, [that] [kingdom] will break in pieces and crush
      
all the others. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">41 &quot;Whereas you
      
saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be
      
divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with
      
ceramic clay. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">42 &quot;And [as] the
      
toes of the feet [were] partly of iron and partly of clay, [so] the kingdom shall be
      
partly strong and partly fragile. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">43 &quot;As you saw
      
iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not
      
adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">44 &quot;And in the
      
days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be
      
destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and
      
consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">45 &quot;Inasmuch as
      
you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in
      
pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold--the great God has made
      
known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its
      
interpretation is sure.&quot; 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">46 Then King
      
Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, prostrate before Daniel, and commanded that they should
      
present an offering and incense to him. 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">47 The king answered
      
Daniel, and said, &quot;Truly your God [is] the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and a
      
revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.&quot; 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">48 Then the king
      
promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts; and he made him ruler over the whole
      
province of Babylon, and chief administrator over all the wise [men] of Babylon.   </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">49 Also Daniel

petitioned the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego over the affairs of the

province of Babylon; but Daniel [sat] in the gate of the king.<br>
