  <p><i>John 1:1-14, 18</i></br>
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4 In him was life, and that life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. 6 There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. 7 He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. 8 He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. 9 The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. 11 He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. 12 Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-- 13 children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. 14 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. . . .18 No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father's side, has made him known.</br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. . . .21 For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. . . . 23 that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.</br>
. . . 26 For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.</br>

  John 6:46, 47</i></br>
  </font>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  <p>46 &quot;Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God; He has seen the Father. 47 &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has everlasting life.</br>

  John 8:57-59</i></br>
  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">57 Then the Jews said to Him, &quot;You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?&quot;</br>
 58 Jesus said to them, &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was,<strong> I AM.</strong>&quot; 59 Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</br>

  <p>1 &quot;Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me.</br>

  Col. 1:15-19</i></br>
  <p>15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. 16 For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. 17 And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist. 18 And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence. 19 For it pleased [the] [Father] [that] in Him all the fullness should dwell,</br>

  <p><i><br>
  Heb. 1:1-3</i></br>
  <p>1 God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, 2 has in these last days spoken to us by [His] Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds; 3 who being the brightness of [His] glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</br>

  <p><i><br>
  Heb. 1:6-12</i></br>
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: &quot;Let all the angels of God worship Him.&quot; 7 And of the angels He says: &quot;Who makes His angels spirits And His ministers a flame of fire.&quot; 8 But to the Son [He] [says]: &quot;Your throne, O God, [is] forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of Your Kingdom. 9 You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.&quot; 10 And: &quot;You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands. 11 They will perish, but You remain; And they will all grow old like a garment; 12 Like a cloak You will fold them up, And they will be changed. But You are the same, And Your years will not fail.&quot;</br>
