    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt 5:17-19</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 &quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.<br>
  18 &quot;For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.<br>
  19 &quot;Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</font><br>
