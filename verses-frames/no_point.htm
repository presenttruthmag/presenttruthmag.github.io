    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom 3:21-23</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, 22 even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference; 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>James 3:2</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For we all stumble in many things. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 John 1:8-10</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.
