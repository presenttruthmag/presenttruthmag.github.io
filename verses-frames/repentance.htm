  <p><i>Luke 15:7-10</i>  
  <P>7 &quot;I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in
  heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no
  repentance. 8 &quot; Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does
  not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds [it]? 9 &quot;And
  when she has found [it], she calls [her] friends and neighbors together, saying, `Rejoice
  with me, for I have found the piece which I lost!' 10 &quot;Likewise, I say to you, there
  is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&quot;<br>

  <p><i>2 Cor. 7:9-10</i>  
  <p>9 Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing. 10 For godly sorrow produces repentance [leading] to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.<br>

  <p><i>Rev. 2:5, 16, 22</i>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 &quot;Remember therefore how you have received and heard; hold fast and repent. Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you. . . . .19 &quot;As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent.<br>
