  <p><i>Gen. 3:1-24</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">:1 Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had
  made. And he said to the woman, &quot;Has God indeed said, `You shall not eat of every
  tree of the garden'?&quot; 2 And the woman said to the serpent, &quot;We may eat the fruit
  of the trees of the garden; 3 &quot;but of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst
  of the garden, God has said, `You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.'
  &quot; 4 Then the serpent said to the woman, &quot;You will not surely die. 5 &quot;For
  God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like
God, knowing good and evil.&quot; </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 So when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for
    food, that it [was] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make [one] wise, she
    took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. 7 Then the
    eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they [were] naked; and they sewed fig
leaves together and made themselves coverings. </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 And they heard the sound of the Lord God
      walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from
      the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 9 Then the Lord God called to
Adam and said to him, &quot;Where [are] you?&quot; </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 So he said, &quot;I heard Your voice
        in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.&quot; 11 And He
        said, &quot;Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I
commanded you that you should not eat?&quot; </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Then the man said, &quot;The woman whom
          You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.&quot; 13 And the Lord God
          said to the woman, &quot;What is this you have done?&quot; The woman said, &quot;The
serpent deceived me, and I ate.&quot; </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 So the Lord God said to the serpent: &quot;Because you have done this, You are cursed more than all cattle, And more than
            every beast of the field; On your belly you shall go, And you shall eat dust All the days
            of your life. 15 And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed
and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel.&quot; </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 To the
              woman He said: &quot;I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; In pain you
              shall bring forth children; Your desire shall be for your husband, And he shall rule
over you.&quot; </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 Then to Adam He said, &quot;Because you have heeded the voice of your
                wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, `You shall not eat of
                it': &quot;Cursed is the ground for your sake; In toil you shall eat of it All the
                days of your life. 18 Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, And you shall
                eat the herb of the field. 19 In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread Till you
                return to the ground, For out of it you were taken; For dust you are, And to dust you
shall return.&quot; </font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of
                  all living. 21 Also for Adam and his wife the Lord God made tunics of skin, and clothed
                  them. 22 Then the Lord God said, &quot;Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know
                  good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and
                  eat, and live forever&quot;&#8212; 23 therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden
                  to till the ground from which he was taken. 24 So He drove out the man; and He placed
                  cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to
                  guard the way to the tree of life.<br>
