  <p><I>1 Pet. 2:6, 7</I>  
  <p>6 Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture, &quot;Behold, I lay in Zion A chief
  cornerstone, elect, precious, And <strong>he who believes</strong> on Him will by no means be put to
  shame.&quot; 7 Therefore, to<strong> you who believe,</strong> He is precious; but to those who are
  disobedient, &quot;The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief
  cornerstone,&quot;<br>
  <p><I>1 Cor. 1:21</I>  
  <p>21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it
  pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save <strong>those who believe.</strong><br>
  <p><i>2 Cor. 4:3-6</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, 4 whose
minds the god of this age has blinded, who do<strong> not believe</strong>, lest the light of the gospel
of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them. 5 For we do not
preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus'
sake. 6 For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in
our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
Christ.<br>
