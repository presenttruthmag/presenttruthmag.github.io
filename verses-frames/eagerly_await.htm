    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Peter 3:9-14</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.<br>

10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.<br>

11 Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,<br>

12 looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?<br>

13 Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.<br>

14 Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless;<br>

28 so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.
