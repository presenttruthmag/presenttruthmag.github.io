  <p>6 But we are all like an unclean [thing], And all our righteousnesses [are] like filthy rags;<br>

  <p><i>John 3:19</i>  
  <p>19 &quot;And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 &quot;For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.&nbsp; <br>
