  <p><i>John 6:46</i>  
  <p>46 &quot;Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God; He has seen the Father. <br>
    
<p><i>John 4:21</i>
<p>21 Jesus said to her, &quot;Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father.<br>
    
<p>John 16:25-28</font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 &quot; These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but I will tell you plainly about the Father. 26 &quot;In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you; 27 &quot;for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from God. 28 &quot;I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.&quot; </font><br>
