<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.
21 For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of [others]; and one is hungry and
another is drunk. 22 What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise
the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I
praise you in this? I do not praise [you]. 23 For I received from the Lord that which I
also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the [same] night in which He was betrayed
took bread; 24 and when He had given thanks, He broke [it] and said, &quot;Take, eat; this
is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&quot; 25 In the same
manner [He] also [took] the cup after supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant
in My blood. This do, as often as you drink [it], in remembrance of Me.&quot; 26 For as
often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death till He
comes. 27 Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks [this] cup of the Lord in an
unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 28 But let a man examine
himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 29 For he who eats and
drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the
Lord's body. 30 For this reason many [are] weak and sick among you, and many sleep. 31 For
if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged. 32 But when we are judged, we are
chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.<br>
