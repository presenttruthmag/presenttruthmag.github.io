  <p><i>1 Pet. 1:4</i>  
  <p>4 to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved
  in heaven for you,<br>

  <p><i>2 Pet. 3:10-13</i>  
  <p>10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will
  pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth
  and the works that are in it will be burned up. 11 Therefore, since all these things will
  be dissolved, what manner [of] [persons] ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, 12
  looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will
  be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat? 13 Nevertheless
  we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness
  dwells.<br>

  <p><i>Heb. 11:16</i>  
  <p>16 But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly [country]. Therefore God is not
  ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.<br>

  <p><i>Rev. 21:1-5</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the
  throne of God and of the Lamb. 2 In the middle of its street, and on either side of the
  river, [was] the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits, each [tree] yielding its fruit
  every month. The leaves of the tree [were] for the healing of the nations. 3 And there
  shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His
  servants shall serve Him. 4 They shall see His face, and His name [shall] [be] on their
  foreheads. 5 There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for
  the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.<br>
