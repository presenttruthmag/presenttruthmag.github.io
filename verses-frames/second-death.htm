  <p><i>Jude 13</i>  
  <p>13 raging waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars for whom is
  reserved the blackness of darkness forever.<br>

  <p><i>Rev. 2:11</i>  
  <p>11 &quot;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who
  overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death.&quot; '<br>

  <p><i>Rev. 20:6, 14</i>  
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 Blessed and holy [is] he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second
  death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with
  Him a thousand years. . . .14 Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.<br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><i>Rev. 21:8</i>  
  <p>8 &quot;But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral,
  sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with
  fire and brimstone, which is the second death.&quot;<br>

  <p><i>Rom. 6:21-23</i>  
  <p>21 What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end
  of those things [is] death. 22 But now having been set free from sin, and having become
  slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life. 23 For the
  wages of sin [is] death, but the gift of God [is] eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>

  <p><i>Jam. 1:15</i></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is
  full-grown, brings forth death.&nbsp;<br>
