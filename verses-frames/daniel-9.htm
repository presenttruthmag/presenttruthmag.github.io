<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 (NKJV) In the first year of Darius
        
the son of Ahasuerus, of the lineage of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the
        
Chaldeans--  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years [specified] by the word of the
        
Lord through Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish seventy years in the
        
desolations of Jerusalem.  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 Then I set my face toward the Lord God to make request by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 And I prayed to the Lord my God, and made confession, and said, &quot;O Lord, great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant
        
and mercy with those who love Him, and with those who keep His commandments, </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 &quot;we have sinned and committed iniquity, we have done wickedly and rebelled, even by departing from Your precepts and
        
Your judgments. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 &quot;Neither have we heeded Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings and our princes, to our fathers
        
and all the people of the land. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 &quot;O Lord, righteousness [belongs] to You, but to us shame of face, as [it] [is] this day--to the men of Judah, to
        
the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, those near and those far off in all the
        
countries to which You have driven them, because of the unfaithfulness which they have
        
committed against You. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 &quot;O Lord, to us [belongs] shame of face, to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, because we have sinned against
        
You. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 &quot;To the Lord our God [belong] mercy and forgiveness, though we have rebelled against Him. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 &quot;We have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in His laws, which He set before us by His servants the
        
prophets. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 &quot;Yes, all Israel has transgressed Your law, and has departed so as not to obey Your voice; therefore the curse
        
and the oath written in the Law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out on us,
        
because we have sinned against Him. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 &quot;And He has confirmed His words, which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us
        
a great disaster; for under the whole heaven such has never been done as what has been
        
done to Jerusalem. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 &quot;As [it] [is] written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us; yet we have not made our prayer before
        
the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities and understand Your truth.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 &quot;Therefore the Lord has kept the disaster in mind, and brought it upon us; for the Lord our God [is] righteous in all
        
the works which He does, though we have not obeyed His voice. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 &quot;And now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and made Yourself a
        
name, as [it] [is] this day--we have sinned, we have done wickedly! </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 &quot;O Lord, according to all Your righteousness, I pray, let Your anger and Your fury be turned away from Your city
        
Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our
        
fathers, Jerusalem and Your people [are] a reproach to all [those] around us. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 &quot;Now therefore, our God, hear the prayer of Your servant, and his supplications, and for the Lord's sake cause Your
        
face to shine on Your sanctuary, which is desolate. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 &quot;O my God, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and see our desolations, and the city which is called by Your
        
name; for we do not present our supplications before You because of our righteous deeds,
        
but because of Your great mercies. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 &quot;O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and act! Do not delay for Your own sake, my God, for Your city and
        
Your people are called by Your name.&quot;  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 Now while I [was] speaking, praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my
        
supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God,  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 yes, while I [was] speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to
        
fly swiftly, reached me about the time of the evening offering.  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 And he informed [me], and talked with me, and said, &quot;O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you skill to understand. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 &quot;At the beginning of your supplications the command went out, and I have come to tell [you], for you [are] greatly
        
beloved; therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision: </font>    
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">24 &quot;Seventy weeks are determined For your people and for your holy city, To finish the transgression, To make an end of sins, To make reconciliation for iniquity, To bring in everlasting righteousness, To seal up vision and prophecy, And to anoint the Most Holy.<br>



  <br>
  25 &quot;Know therefore and understand, [That] from the going forth of the command To restore and build Jerusalem Until Messiah the Prince, [There] [shall] [be] seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; The street shall be built again, and the wall, Even in troublesome times.<br>



  <br>
  26 &quot;And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself; And the people of the prince who is to come Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it [shall] [be] with a flood, And till the end of the war desolations are determined.<br>



  <br>
  27 Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; But in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominationsm shall be one who makes desolate, Even until the consummation, which is determined, Is poured out on the desolate.&quot;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
