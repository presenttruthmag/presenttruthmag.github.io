<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 Now the <strong>works of the flesh</strong> are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, 20 idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, 21 envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice <strong>such things</strong> will not inherit the kingdom of God.
