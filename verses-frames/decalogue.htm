  <p><I>Ex. 20:1-17</I></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 And God spoke all these words, saying: 2 &quot; I am the Lord your God, who brought
you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 &quot; You shall have no
other gods before Me. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 &quot; You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any
    likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
    that is in the water under the earth; 5 you shall not bow down to them nor serve them.
    For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the
    children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, 6 but showing mercy
to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 &quot; You shall not take
      the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who
takes His name in vain. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 &quot; Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days you
        shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your
        God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male
        servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your
        gates. 11 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that
        is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and
hallowed it. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 &quot; Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon
the land which the Lord your God is giving you. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 &quot; You shall not murder. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 &quot;
You shall not commit adultery. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 &quot; You shall not steal. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 &quot; You shall not bear
false witness against your neighbor. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 &quot; You shall not covet your neighbor's house;
                    you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant,
                    nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.&quot;</font><br>
