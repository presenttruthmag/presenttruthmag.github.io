    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 8:46</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me?<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor 5:21</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Heb 4:15</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Heb 7:25-26</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. 26 For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens;<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Heb 9:24</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Lev 1:3-5</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 'If his offering is a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it of his own free will at the door of the tabernacle of meeting before the LORD. 4 'Then he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him. 5 'He shall kill the bull before the LORD; and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of meeting.<br>



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Lev 22:21</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 'And whoever offers a sacrifice of a peace offering to the LORD, to fulfill his vow, or a freewill offering from the cattle or the sheep, it must be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no defect in it.



  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
  Num 19:2-4</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 &quot;This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying: 'Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect and on which a yoke has never come. 3 'You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, that he may take it outside the camp, and it shall be slaughtered before him; 4 'and Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and sprinkle some of its blood seven times directly in front of the tabernacle of meeting.
