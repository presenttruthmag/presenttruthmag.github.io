  <p><i>Gen. 1:2</i>  
  <p>2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.<br>

  <p><i>Matt. 28:18, 19</i>  
  <p>18 Then Jesus came to them and said, &quot;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,<br>
    
<p><i>John 3:5-8</i>
<p>5 Jesus answered, &quot;I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. 6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. 7 You should not be surprised at my saying, `You must be born again.' 8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.&quot;<br>

  <p><i>John 4:24</i>  
  <p>24 God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.&quot;<br>
    
<p><i>John 14:9-18</i>
<p>9 Jesus answered: &quot;Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, `Show us the Father'? 10 Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. 11 Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves. 12 I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. 13 And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. 14 You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. 15 &quot;If you love me, you will obey what I command. 16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever-- 17 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. 18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.&nbsp;<br>

  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 14:16-17, 25-26</i><br>
    16 &quot;And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another
  Helper, that He may abide with you forever-- 17 &quot;the Spirit of truth, whom the world
  cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells
  with you and will be in you.....25 &quot; These things I have spoken to you while being present with you. 26 &quot;But
  the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all
  things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.<br>
  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 15:26-27</i><br>
      26 &quot; But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you
  from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify of Me.
  27 &quot;And you also will bear witness, because you have been with Me from the beginning.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Luke 11:9-13</i><br>
  9 &quot; So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek,
  and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 10 &quot;For everyone who asks
  receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 11 &quot;If a
  son asks for bread from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if [he] [asks]
  for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish? 12 &quot;Or if he asks for an
  egg, will he offer him a scorpion? 13 &quot;If you then, being evil, know how to give good
  gifts to your children, how much more will [your] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to
  those who ask Him!&quot;<br>
