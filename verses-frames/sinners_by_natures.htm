  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. 24 O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 I thank God&nbsp;&#8212; through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.<br>
