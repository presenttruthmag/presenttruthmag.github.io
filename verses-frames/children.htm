  <p><I>Matt. 19:13-14</I>  
  <p>13 Then little <strong>children</strong> were brought to Him that He might put His hands on them and
  pray, but the disciples rebuked them. 14 But Jesus said, &quot;Let the little <strong>children</strong>  come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.&quot;<br>
  <p><i>Eph. 6:1-4</i>  
  <p>1 <strong>Children</strong>, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 2 &quot;Honor your father and mother,&quot; which is the first commandment with promise: 3 &quot;that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth.&quot; 4 And you, fathers, do not provoke your <strong>children</strong> to wrath, but bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord. <br>
  <p><i>Col. 3:20-21</i>  
  <p>20 <strong>Children</strong>, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing to the Lord. 21 Fathers, do not provoke your <strong>children</strong>, lest they become discouraged.<br>
