    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Acts 20:35</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I have shown you in every way, by laboring like this, that you must support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.' &quot;

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor 9:6-7</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.<br>

7 So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.
