    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Mark 10:17-22</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 Now as He was going out on the road, one came running, knelt before Him, and asked Him, &quot;Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?&quot; 18 So Jesus said to him, &quot;Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. 19 &quot;You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not murder,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not bear false witness,' 'Do not defraud,' 'Honor your father and your mother.' &quot; 20 And he answered and said to Him, &quot;Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth.&quot; 21 Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, &quot;One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.&quot; 22 But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.<br>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Mark 12:28-34</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">28 Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, &quot;Which is the first commandment of all?&quot; 29 Jesus answered him, &quot;The first of all the commandments is: 'Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is one. 30 'And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the first commandment. 31 &quot;And the second, like it, is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these.&quot; 32 So the scribe said to Him, &quot;Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but He. 33 &quot;And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.&quot; 34 Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, &quot;You are not far from the kingdom of God.&quot; But after that no one dared question Him.<br>

    Matt 5:17-19</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 &quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. 18 &quot;For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. 19 &quot;Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br>
