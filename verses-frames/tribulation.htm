  <p><i>Dan. 12:1-3</i>  
  <p>1 &quot;At that time Michael shall stand up, The great prince who stands [watch] over
      the sons of your people; And there shall be a time of trouble, Such as never was since
      there was a nation, [Even] to that time. And at that time your people shall be delivered,
      Every one who is found written in the book. 2 And many of those who sleep in the dust of
      the earth shall awake, Some to everlasting life, Some to shame [and] everlasting contempt.
      3 Those who are wise shall shine Like the brightness of the firmament, And those who turn
      many to righteousness Like the stars forever and ever.<br>
    
<p><i>Matt. 24:21, 29</i>

      beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. . . . 29 &quot; Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and
      the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the
      heavens will be shaken.<br>
