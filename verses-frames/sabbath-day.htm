  <p><I>Ex. 20:8-11</I><br>
    <br>
    8 &quot; Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do
    all your work, 10 but the seventh day [is] the Sabbath of the Lord your God. [In] [it] you
    shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your
    female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who [is] within your gates. 11 For [in]
    six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that [is] in them, and
    rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.<br>
<p><I>Matt. 12:8</I>
<p>8 &quot;For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.&quot;<br>

  <p><I>Matt. 24:20</I>  
  <p>20 &quot;And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath.<br>
    
<p><I>Luke 23:54-56</I><br>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">54 That day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew near. 55 And the women who had
come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was
laid. 56 Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And they rested on the
Sabbath according to the commandment.<br>
