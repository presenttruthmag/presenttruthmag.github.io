  <p><i>Gen. 3:8-24</i>  
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the
    garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of
    the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 9 Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to
    him, &quot;Where [are] you?&quot; 10 So he said, &quot;I heard Your voice in the garden,
    and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.&quot; 11 And He said, &quot;Who
    told you that you [were] naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that
    you should not eat?&quot; 12 Then the man said, &quot;The woman whom You gave [to] [be]
    with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.&quot; 13 And the Lord God said to the woman,
  &quot;What [is] this you have done?&quot; The woman said, &quot;The serpent deceived me,
    and I ate.&quot; 14 So the Lord God said to the serpent: &quot;Because you have done this,
    You [are] cursed more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your
    belly you shall go, And you shall eat dust All the days of your life. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between
  your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel.&quot; 16
  To the woman He said: &quot;I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; In
  pain you shall bring forth children; Your desire [shall] [be] for your husband, And he
  shall rule over you.&quot; 17 Then to Adam He said, &quot;Because you have heeded the
  voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, `You
  shall not eat of it': &quot;Cursed [is] the ground for your sake; In toil you shall eat
  [of] it All the days of your life. 18 Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for
  you, And you shall eat the herb of the field. 19 In the sweat of your face you shall eat
  bread Till you return to the ground, For out of it you were taken; For dust you [are], And
  to dust you shall return.&quot; 20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was
  the mother of all living. 21 Also for Adam and his wife the Lord God made tunics of skin,
  and clothed them. 22 Then the Lord God said, &quot;Behold, the man has become like one of
  Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of
  life, and eat, and live forever&quot;-- 23 therefore the Lord God sent him out of the
  garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken. 24 So He drove out the man; and
  He placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned
  every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.<br>
