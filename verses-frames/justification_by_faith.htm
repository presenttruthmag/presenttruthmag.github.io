  <p><i>Romans 5:1, 8-11</i>  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, . . . 8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. 10 For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. 11 And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
