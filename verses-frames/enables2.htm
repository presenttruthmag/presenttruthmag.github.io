<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. <br>

16 Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward [man] is being renewed day by day.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. <br>

13 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
