    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Ps 25:6-11</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 Remember, O LORD, Your tender mercies and Your lovingkindnesses, For they are from of old.<br>

7 Do not remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; According to Your mercy remember me, For Your goodness' sake, O LORD.<br>

8 Good and upright is the LORD; Therefore He teaches sinners in the way.<br>

9 The humble He guides in justice, And the humble He teaches His way.<br>

10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth, To such as keep His covenant and His testimonies.<br>

11 For Your name's sake, O LORD, Pardon my iniquity, for it is great.<br>

    </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 Be merciful to me, O Lord, For I cry to You all day long.<br>

4 Rejoice the soul of Your servant, For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.<br>

5 For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in mercy to all those who call upon You.<br>

6 Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; And attend to the voice of my supplications.<br>

7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon You, For You will answer me.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors.<br>

13 And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.<br>
14 "For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.<br>
15 "But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. <br>
