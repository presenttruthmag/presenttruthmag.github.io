<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:1 When <strong>Abram</strong> was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared
    to Abram and said to him, &quot;I am Almighty God; walk before Me and be blameless. 2
  &quot;And I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you
    exceedingly.&quot; 3 Then <strong>Abram</strong> fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying: 4
  &quot;As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many
    nations. 5 &quot;No longer shall your name be called <strong>Abram</strong>, but your name shall be
    <strong>Abraham</strong>; for I have made you a father of many nations. 6 &quot;I will make you exceedingly
    fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. 7 &quot;And I
    will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their
    generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you.
    8 &quot;Also I give to you and your descendants after you the land in which you are a
    stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their
    God.&quot;<br>
