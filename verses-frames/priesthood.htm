  <p><I>1 Pet. 2:5-9</I>  
  <p>5 you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood,
  to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 6 Therefore it is
  also contained in the Scripture, &quot;Behold, I lay in Zion A chief cornerstone, elect,
  precious, And he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame.&quot; 7 Therefore,
  to you who believe, [He] [is] precious; but to those who are disobedient, &quot;The stone
  which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone,&quot; 8 and &quot;A stone of
  stumbling And a rock of offense.&quot; They stumble, being disobedient to the word, to
  which they also were appointed. 9 But you [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a
  holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called
  you out of darkness into His marvelous light; 10 who once [were] not a people but [are]
  now the people of God, who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy.</p>
