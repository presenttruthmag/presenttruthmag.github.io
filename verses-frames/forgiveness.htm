  <p><i>Luke 18:9-14<br>
  </i>9 Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were
righteous, and despised others: 10 &quot;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a
Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 &quot;The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with
himself, `God, I thank You that I am not like other men--extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
or even as this tax collector. 12 `I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I
possess.' 13 &quot;And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise
[his] eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, `God, be merciful to me a sinner!' 14
&quot;I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other; for
everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be
exalted.&quot; <br>
  
  <p><i>Col. 1:13</i></br>
  <p>13 For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,</br>
    <br>
  <p><i>Eph. 1:7</i></br>
  <p>7 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace</br>
    <br>
  <p><i>Rom. 4:7</i></br>
  <p>7 &quot;Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.</br>
    <br>    
<p><i>Col. 2:12-14</i></br>

He forgave us all our sins, 14 having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross.</br>
