              <font face="Arial" size="2"> <font size="3">When our Lord told Nicodemas about His eternal Lordship as the Son of God and also about the invisible Holy Spirit who gives rebirth to those who believe in the sinless life and atoning death of the only begotten Son, Nicodemas asked, &quot;How can these things be?&quot; What was Christ's answer? </font></font></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things , and ye believe not,how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?&quot;</font></p>
              </blockquote>              
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Our response to the truth about who God is must not to be &quot;how?&quot; but must be the response of Thomas, &quot;my Lord and my God&quot; and worship Him.<br>
              <br>
              Next to hating the teaching of justification by faith, Satan also hates the teaching that God exists and is manifested to His creation as God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Satan's first challenge in heaven was in regards to the eternal Godhood of Jesus Christ. Satan's first attack upon Christ in the wilderness temptation was upon Christ's equality with God as the Son of God. Only those who are of faith can say that Jesus is LORD and the One mediator between God and Man. </font></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Teach this to your children because the word of God teaches us that the &quot;Word became flesh and dwelt among us and we held His glory as of the Only Begotten of the Father&quot;. This is not a matter of &quot;how?&quot; but a matter of &quot;Amen and Amen&quot;!!! Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. Elohim and LORD God Almighty from eternity to eternity.<br>
              <br>
              Much of the confusion over Christ's &quot;submission&quot; statements is because He was both God and Man. As the new Adam, and the new head of the human family, He, although fully God was also after the incarnation, fully Man. As the new representative of the human family, He was speaking as being in total submission to the Father in stating, &quot;My Father is greater than I.&quot; Even after all of Christ's enemies are made His footstool and He is forever exalted as King of Kings in a universe cleansed from the blight of sin, He will then as the New Adam offer up the kingdom to God and be in subjection unto the Father.<br>
              <br>
              As the Son of God from all eternity, Christ, the Logos, was and still is the visible express image of the Father and the Spirit. The Father dwells in unapproachable light and no one has seen His face. The Spirit has no visible form. Thus God as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is&#8212;<br>
              <br>
              1.) The Transcendent One&#8212; God the Father<br>
              2.) The Emanant One&#8212; God the Son (<em>Logos</em>)<br>
              3,) The  Upholding,  Sustaining, and <font face="Arial">Indwelling </font>One&#8212; God the Holy Spirit<br>
              <br>
              These three,  in whose names we are baptized, are the three divine names in which God has chosen to reveal Himself to us. We cannot explain all the &quot;how&quot; of God, but we can understand the clear testimony of Scripture that the Father is God, the Son Jesus Christ is God, and the Holy Spirit is God.<br>
              <br>
              We cannot even fully understand the ultimate reality of matter and space and time so how can finite man hope to fully understand the ultimate reality of the nature of God?? We now see through the window of reality dimly, but soon we shall see Him face to face. Then we shall know Him even as we are known of Him.<br>
              <br>
              Should we pray to the Holy Spirit? No, the Spirit does not speak of Himself. His office is to glorify the Son and take the things that pertain to the kingdom and the power and the glory and the honor of the Son and reveal them unto us.<br>
              <br>
              Will Durante, the humanist historian, was an avowed antagonist to the Christian faith so don't expect him to put Christianity in an honest and true perspective. The fact is that since the days of Nimrod, the counterfeit religion of Cain has always sought to worship the creature rather than the creator. All the truths of Christianity have an abominable counterpart in the mysteries of Babylon. The ancient religions of Zoroastrianism, Mithraism, Gnosticism, the Greek pantheon, the Egyptian pantheon and the Hindu pantheon all are derivations of the same religion begun at the tower of Babel by Nimrod and his &quot;virgin&quot; mother/wife Semaramis and going even further back in history to the religion of Cain who slew his brother Abel. Even the myth of Hercules comes from the ancient religion begun when Nimrod and his worshippers were cursed after the flood.<br>
              <br>
              We must be exceedingly careful when we are dealing with these themes and not be rash and irreverent when we discuss the God whom we worship. Jesus was God in the flesh. He was worshipped by His disciples and He forgave sin. His glory caused the mob seeking His life to fall back when He spoke His name, &quot;I am He&quot;, <em>ego emi.</em> This is no mere human conundrum that we are seeking to unravel. These matters are of eternal and salvific significance because it matters that we worship the True God and honor the Son and the Father. Those who willingly refuse to bow in worship of the Son and the Father and the Holy Spirit will have no part in the kingdom of God. I urge you to humble your heart before our Savior and God, the Lord Jesus Christ and worship and honor Him and believe in Him as the One who is set down in the throne with His Father and before whom every knee shall bow.<br>
              <br>
              I have a duty before God and man to tell the truth of the Gospel. What I have stated is not harsh or unkind, but rather it is absolutely true. The blood of souls would be on my hands if I were to not state the absolute truth regarding the seriousness of the Arian and Semi-Arian error. Those who teach this and believe this are blaspheming the Spirit of Truth and the word of God. To those who teach this error it is surely true that, &quot;in vain do they worship Me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of men.&quot; </font></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">I myself was diverted into serious error for a while and if it had not been for a good friend in Christ who sternly reproved me and warned me and rebuked my false doctrine, I would still be wandering in the darkness of the New Age Movement and believing the lies of the Devil. I was bound by the lies of which you are now bound and if I had not been rebuked by my friend I would be eternally lost and an enemy of the true God. By God's grace I came to my senses and repented of all my false doctrine and burned all of the abominable books in my library. </font></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">The great lie of the Devil is that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is not Eternal LORD God Almighty and that the Holy Spirit is only the <em>influence</em> of God which all men have in their hearts. Those who cling to the doctrine of Arius and deny the eternal deity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit will eventually become pantheists if this error is carried to it's logical conclusion. </font></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Deity CANNOT be conferred upon any creature by the infilling of the Spirit of God. God cannot declare a created being to be God!!! The term Only Begotten Son of God does not refer to the &quot;creation&quot; of Jesus or His being the first created being in the beginning. &quot;Only begotten son of God&quot; refers to Christ's equal authority and equal divinity with the Father from all eternity.  Jesus is the express image of the Father and the visible manifestation of the invisible Holy Spirit to all the created order. He is the One mediator between the Father and all created beings. As the <em>Logos</em>, He is the Word of God, the Mediator through whom God communicates with all His creation. When Christ became the second Adam, His eternal power and glory and Deity were veiled by human flesh but even the demons knew who He was and trembled in His presence.<br>
              <br>
              To all who refuse to worship the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I must solemnly warn you to return to the truth of the word of God and repent of your vanity and bow down and worship the God of the Bible. If after reading all of the texts that I have presented, you still cannot see the truth then I can only tell you that the god of this world has blinded your eyes and you are bound to spend eternity with the god of your own choosing. &quot;Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His Judgment has come. Worship Him who made heaven and earth and the sea and all that dwells therein&quot;. Truly God has revealed His truth unto babes but He has blinded the eyes of those who refuse to see.</font><b><br>
