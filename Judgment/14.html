              </b><font size="3">Satan is very religious. True, he deceives some with the pleasures of worldliness and atheism but his best and most deceptive lies are his &quot;religious&quot; lies. He was a liar and a Serpent from the beginning so it is very natural that he loves to take the Word of God and make it seem to teach something it does not. Peter warns us about these false apostles who turn the truth of God into a lie. </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2 Peter 3:15-18 ... the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; 16 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable WREST, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. 17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. 18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Isn't it amazing that the apostle that God used so mightily to take the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ to all the world in the first century of the Christian era, should have his epistles so misused not only in our day but in the apostolic era as well!! </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Paul was constantly having to wage an ongoing battle against false teachers. Nearly every epistle Paul wrote was directed towards the defeat of these false teachers and yet we see the sad disregard of Paul's warnings in the near total strangle-hold that the false prophet of the Man of Sin has upon Christendom.<br>
          
              <br>
            The &quot;Image to the Beast&quot; which we see today gaining strength in the Ecumenical Movement is to be found in the teachings of the early Judiasing Gnostic Christians. These men trailed behind Paul in all his travels, teaching wherever there were Christian communities. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">They denied Paul's teaching that Christ suffered bodily upon the cross of Calvary and they denied that He made a complete vicarious atonement for our sins. They taught that we are justified and accepted before God by keeping the Law, i.e. the ceremonial laws and the moral laws&#8212;perfectly. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">To these false teachers, our Lord was a perfect, sinless &quot;angel&quot; man who showed us how to be saved by striving to live a sinless life in obeying all of the Law, just as Jesus obeyed the Law. When we obey the Law perfectly, observing all of the moral laws, all of the ceremonial feasts, the fast days (see Romans 14), the washings of purification, the sabbaths, the sacrifices, the tithings, and the dietary restrictions, then God will accept us by our having fulfilled all of the demands of the Law for righteousness. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Secret rites of purification took the initiate from baptism up the ladder of the deeper &quot;knowledge&quot; of the &quot;mysteries&quot; of coming to perfect oneness with God and God-likeness. Ritual washings, prayer vigils, self humiliation, and calling on the great ascended &quot;Masters&quot; of the universe, of which Christ was merely one of many, to drive out all &quot;fleshly&quot; or &quot;material&quot; desires and sin.<br>
                      
              <br>
            Paul foresaw that these Judaeisers would take over the Church after his death:</font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a<strong> falling away</strong> first, and that <strong>man of sin</strong> be revealed, the son of perdition; 4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. 5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? 6 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time. 7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth [will let], until he be taken out of the way. 8 And then shall that Wicked (Wicked One) be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: 9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 11 And for this cause God shall send them <strong>strong delusion</strong>, that they should believe a lie: 12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. 2 Thes 2:3-12</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">This prophecy met its fulfillment in the gradual development of the Papal pseudo-Christian system of salvation by man's works as seen in the &quot;sacrifice of the mass&quot; and works of penance to lessen the pains of purgatory in the hereafter. In this system we see the keeping of a multitude of holy days devoted to prayer to a certain saint for each particular day; holy (day) seasons; holy water; holy candles; holy wafers (the &quot;real&quot; presence); holy intercessors (the perfected saints and the perfected Virgin); holy priests; holy sacraments; holy chants; holy signs of the cross; and holy sanctuaries (cathedrals which imitate the ancient Hebrew tabernacle with the holy place, the most holy place, the alter, the censor filled with incense, the candles, the shew bread, the choirs, and a high priest offfering the sacrifice). All of this is described  as &quot;another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb&quot; by St. John in Revelation.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">The papal Man of Sin urges the religious world to disregard the true Gospel of the completed and once and for all sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ for the sins of the world. The true gospel urges all repentant sinners to come in faith only to Jesus and to trust in the Sinless One who continually offers to cover our sins with His own perfect righteousness. Our true Mediator is in heaven standing for the people of God. The incense of His righteousness is added to the imperfect prayers, praise, and good works of even the weakest of God's people so that those who trust in His atoning life and death are accepted before the holiness of God, perfect in Him and for His sake. There is perfect holiness only in Heaven. Christ's holiness fills all heaven and we are complete in Him.<br>
                              
              <br>
              The so-called <em>holy</em> places, and <em>holy</em> things on Earth are &quot;abominations that make desolate&quot; because they take the hope of the repentant sinner off of Jesus' perfect holiness in heaven and cause the sinner to look to man's holiness and man's holy things and a counterfeit Priesthood to reconcile us to God. Thus this system becomes the pseudo or anti-Christ&#8212;the Image of a Man with the eyes of a Man and the sinful heart of a Man and the number of a Man, 666, the pseudo-Vicar of the Son of God, <em>Vicarivs Felii Dei</em>, hiding behind a false disguise of pseudo holiness and claiming to speak for God while actually speaking for the Serpent with all deceit and guile of pretended purity.<br>
                              
              <br>
              But God will not always tolerate the proud boasts of the Apostate One who rides upon the Beast. A mighty heaven blessed gospel message attended by one mighty final outpouring of the true Holy Spirit in &quot;latter rain&quot; power shall declare the sins of Babylon to all the listening world. The Christian churches and all of the religions of the world who have united within the Ecumenical Movement will be told of the inroads of spiritualism that have filled the churches and the world with every foul and unclean spirit. This spiritualism is a false &quot;charismatic&quot; spirit which Satan breaths upon all who bow down to pay obeisance to the union of the papacy, apostate Protestantism and Pentecostalism. Satan will convince those who imbibe in this spirit that they are sinless and holy. By acknowledging a false unscriptural Sunday Sabbath, Satan and his demons will infill with his spirit all who worship the Beast or receive his mark or the number of his name.<br>
                              
              <br>
            But the final loud proclamation of the true Gospel and outpouring of the true Holy Spirit will interrupt and unmask the deceiver who thinks he can change the Everlasting Covenant and cast God's holy Law to the ground by making void the 4th commandment. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">The Sabbath commandment proclaims God as the Creator of heaven and earth and all living things. The Sabbath commandment rips away the mask of Darwinian evolutionary perfectionism and exposes it as a whited sepulcher full of dead men's bones. The False Prophet seeks to deny the blood of the Lamb and count it as an unholy thing, but the last Gospel message to the world will give the final proclamation of mercy for all involved in the Babylonish union to &quot;come out of her&quot; and come unto the wedding supper of the Lamb who has redeemed us unto God by His precious blood. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">As the blood upon the door posts protected all the people of God on the first Passover night so long ago, so in the final moments of Earth's history God will justify all the repentant ones who look to the One who was declared <em>guilty</em> for them so that they might be declared <em>innocent</em> in Him. There is none too sinful or too degraded who cannot look to Calvary and receive the verdict of innocence and acquittal before our Judge and Advocate and merciful High Priest who presents us faultless before the throne of grace. </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Much more then having been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him...through whom we have now received the reconciliation.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Those who heed God's call and will come out of Babylon will reject Satan's claim to be able to change God's Law and will trust in the blood of Christ alone to justify them. These will receive seal of God, the infilling of God's Holy Spirit to prepare them to pass through the great tribulation time of the seven last plagues which are poured out upon the unrepentant worshippers of the Beast and his Image. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">As Noah and his family were preserved safely in the ark during the visitation of God's wrath upon the antediluvian world, so God's people will dwell in the shadow of His protective watchcare. They will have been sealed in the Lamb's book of life and will see Him come in the clouds of heaven. Looking up they will rejoice in the glory of God and say, </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Lo, this is our God, we have waited for Him and He will save us.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">God has blinded the eyes of the wise but revealed His wisdom unto babes.<br>
