Old traditional perfectionistic Adventism will decrease while the evangelical gospel of Christ will increase within the Adventist movement. The old Adventism is gone and has been swept away in the message of Christ Our Righteousness. The gospel message which will swallow up all other messages within Adventism is the good news that all repentant sinners are justified by the unmerited grace of God alone, through </font><font size="3"><font face="Arial">faith </font></font><font face="Arial"> in the sinless life and atoning death of our Lord Jesus Christ alone as revealed in the Bible alone. This is the three angel's messages in verity. This message does not destroy Seventh-day Adventism; it fulfills it. This message is neither antinomianism nor legalism. This message does not do away with the Sabbath but rather magnifies it and puts it on an even firmer footing.<br>
  
<br>
All the world will be judged by its response to the good news that all of our transgressions of God's holy Law have been blotted out eternally in Jesus Christ. All who are in Christ by faith have been brought to perfection and already have eternal life in Him. Those who are in Christ by faith have been found &quot;not guilty&quot; before the holy and good and perfect Law of God. We are presented as faultless before His throne of Grace in the hour of God's judgment.<br>
  
<br>
Some are fighting a paper tiger that no longer exists. Ellen G. White is NOT the final authority for the evangelical Seventh-day Adventist movement which is victoriously emerging from the spiritual battles with the powers of darkness within Adventism. Sinless perfection in the believer is NOT the hope of the Adventism which will emerge from the final shaking of this movement. This shaking is being caused by the testimony of the True Witness that we are wretched and miserable, poor, blind, and naked. The &quot;rich and increased with goods&quot; perfectionists are rejecting this reproof which exposes their hopeless condition of seeking enough righteousness in sanctification to be ready for the coming of the Lord. </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="3"><font face="Arial">On the other hand, it is the <em>antinomians</em> who want to rip the fourth commandment from the Decalogue and who reject this reproof to the Laodiceans which exposes their open rebellion to the holy Law of God. Christ clearly said that we are not to think  that Christ has come to destroy God's Law!! He came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfill its righteous demands for the vilest of this world's sinners who believes. The good news of the Gospel is that we are not justified by a righteousness that is seen on earth. We are justified from all sin by virtue of the righteousness that is in heaven in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ. No man or woman who is justified by grace alone will  be willfully transgressing the holy Law of God in either spirit or letter. All of God's commandments are good and righteous and pure. Those who delight in Christ will also delight in God's Law which Christ came to honor and establish and fulfill.<br>
    
            <br>
              Shall we who are justified by grace alone through faith  in Christ  destroy God's holy Law? No, God forbid, we will always seek to establish the Law. Those who seek to destroy the Law will be called the &quot;least&quot; in the kingdom of God and will finally be destroyed with the Lawless One in the lake of fire.<br>
    
            <br>
              Sin is transgression of the Law and by the Law is the knowledge of sin. We cannot know sin &quot;unless the Law had said...&quot;. Those who choose to willfully disregard God's Law will not be covered by the perfect imputed righteous Law-keeping of our Savior. </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="3"><font face="Arial">He mediates His perfect righteousness before the holy Law of God in the heavens as our high priest and judge and king after the order of Melchizedec. His perfect Law-keeping is the only hope of all repentant sinners who trust in Him. He came NOT to destroy the Law, but rather to fulfill it. All who walk in Christ will love God's holy Law, because they no longer walk in the flesh but rather seek the things of the Spirit. The righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in those who walk in the Spirit. The Law in letter and in spirit is written upon the hearts of all who are of faith. By their fruit we will know them.  </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="3"><font face="Arial">All things are ready!  Come unto the wedding supper of the Lamb. In Christ we are more than conquerors!!<br>
