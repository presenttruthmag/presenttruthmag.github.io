            Acting in all its forms is a lie and an abomination. There is no time for Christians to be filling our hearts and minds with the abominations of the heathen who do not love our Lord nor appreciate the price He paid for our redemption. We must flee fiction and worldliness in all its forms and media. The reason many are so indifferent to the marvelous grace of our Lord is that we have so shallow a view of sin and the love of the world and the things of the world. We must not yield an inch of ground to the great Deceiver. God is not mocked, whatsoever we sow we will also reap. Only those who are sighing and crying for the abominations done in the land and especially the Church of God will receive the seal of God in this judgment hour. We must be about our Father's business or we will be counted among the foolish virgins who had no oil for their lamps and were dwelling in Satan's bewitching fantasy land. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The world is rushing on to ruin and those who do not make a decided effort to resist and speak out against the tide of evil will be overcome of the evil one. These final hours before the storm breaks upon us must be spent in heart preparation and in deep repentance for our own lack of the fruits of the Spirit in our lives. Those who are not seeking to perfect holiness in the sight of God are not Christians and are self deceived. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The solemn words of the prophets must do their work in the soul or we will be cut down as cumberers of the soil. </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And they shall look upon Him whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for Him as one mourns for an only Son.&quot;, </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed. The night is far spent, the Day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light . Let us walk properly and in the day not in revelry and drunkenness not in lewdness and lust, not in strife and envy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart. Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. But ye have not so learned Christ; If so be that ye have heard Him, and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus: That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; And be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. </font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another. Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: Neither give place to the Devil. Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. </font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour. </font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. </font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Let no man DECEIVE you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Be not ye therefore PARTAKERS with them. For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth) Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. </font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. Wherefore He saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"> See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Make no mistake about it, we are justified by faith  in the perfect life and atoning death of our Lord Jesus Christ, alone but faith that does not take up the cross and follow Jesus in the narrow gate is not faith. Those who love Jesus will hate the sin that is in their own hearts and lives and will not bring the world into their soul temples to worship at the altar of Baal. Sin&#8212;our personal sins and the sins of the world&#8212;brought the Savior of the world to this sin darkened planet to restore the moral image of God in man. Those who love Him will love what He loves and hate that which He hates. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">None of us claim perfection, far from it, but only those who are pursuing victory till Jesus comes will be approved in that Day. All of us have pasts that we wish we could undo and present failures which we mourn over and seek to overcome. We all fail daily to meet the mark of the high calling in Christ, but we are to press on, ignoring the taunts of the lovers of this world who point to our past sin and hypocrisy. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">May the Lord who pleads His merits for us before the Father's throne give us the eyesalve to see our own nakedness that our shame does not appear. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord does not impute iniquity, whose sins are covered.</font><br>
