        </b><font size="3">I realize that few will want to wade through a long exegesis of Roman 9 but I will address this to those who are wrestling with the subject of the &quot;foreknowledge&quot;, &quot;predestination&quot;, &quot;election&quot;, and &quot;elect&quot; of God.<br>
  
        <br>
          When one approaches Paul's epistle to the Roman's, one must always keep in mind the fact that Paul's central theme in all of his epistles is the GOOD NEWS of God's MERCY and GRACE to &quot;ALL&quot; the world through FAITH in Jesus Christ. Grace to Paul is the UNMERITED mercy of God to lost sinners. This means that God freely, without good works, forgives and accepts any repentant sinner who puts his faith in Christ Jesus. Thus Paul begins his discourse on the Grace of God in chapter one of Romans stating emphatically that God saves &quot;ALL who believe, first the Jew and also the Gentile&quot;(1:16). God's saving action in Christ &quot;begins in faith and ends in faith&quot;(1:17) for &quot;ALL&quot;. If we miss the word &quot;all&quot; in the beginning of the epistle, we will stumble when we come to the more difficult to understand portions of the epistle in chapter 9.<br>
  
        <br>
          In order to make the point that God will save ANYONE who puts their faith in Christ, Paul undergirds his entire theme of GRACE FOR ALL by declaring that ALL, both Jews and Gentiles, are &quot;under sin&quot; and that ALL are subject to the just punishment of God and under the His &quot;JUDGMENT&quot; (3:19) Then Paul skillfully wields the sword of God's word by declaring, &quot;...for there is NO difference, for ALL have sinned, and (all) (continually) come short of the glory of God.&quot; Rom 3:22. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Thus in one fell swoop, Paul lays our pride and our boasting in the dust! Every mouth is stopped. All the world is brought into condemnation and judgment before the holiness and righteousness of God! But God does not leave us without hope and in total despair. Rather, God brings ALL the world into condemnation that He may have mercy on ALL who put their faith in the doing and dying of Jesus Christ, the Jew first and also the Gentile. This phrase &quot;the Jew first and also the Gentile&quot; is an all inclusive, all embracing term. NO ONE is left out.<br>
    
            <br>
              It is absolutely imperative that we emphasize the word &quot;ALL&quot; in the first chapters of Romans or we will stumble when we come to Paul's discourse on election and predestination in Romans 9. Now, let us with courage and taking a deep breath, take a look at one of the most misunderstood passages in all of the Bible!<br>
    
            <br>
              With the Pauline concept that &quot;ALL&quot; are by nature under condemnation and hopelessly lost in trespass and sin firmly in mind, Paul declares in Romans 9 that God in His unmerited mercy chose the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to be the lineage through which He would reveal His mercy. This choice of Isaac was not because of anything that Isaac had done in the way of &quot;works&quot;, but purely on the basis of God's unmerited &quot;grace&quot;. As Paul states of God, &quot;I will have mercy on anyone I wish and I will have pity on anyone I wish.&quot; So that &quot;everything depends not on what man wants or does, but on God's mercy&quot; Rom 9:16-17.<br>
    
            <br>
              Then Paul asks the hypothetical question, &quot;How can God find fault with (condemn) anyone?&quot; Paul's answer is that even though God's &quot;lump of clay&quot;, the human family, is lost in trespasses and deserving of &quot;God's anger&quot; (Rom 9:22), God has by His grace chosen some of this clay and made a &quot;bowl for special occasions&quot; which differs from the &quot;bowl made for common use&quot;. Those who believe, from either the Jews or the Gentiles (Rom 9:24), are of the &quot;bowl made for special occasions&quot; and prepared to receive His glory. (Rom 9:23). Thus Paul is declaring that &quot;all&quot; who believe are predestined to receive &quot;glory&quot; because they are put right with God through faith. (Rom 9:30).<br>
    
            <br>
              Paul then anticipates the question in the minds of his readers, &quot;Why then are not all those children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob saved?&quot; His answer is that because the majority were seeking to be put right with God through the keeping of the Law, they were not true children of Abraham since Abraham himself was not justified before God by keeping of the Law but rather by faith in God's mercy.(Rom 9:30-33). They therefore &quot;stumbled&quot; on the &quot;stumbling stone&quot;, Jesus Christ.<br>
    
            <br>
              Now with all this background carefully laid, we can understand those &quot;predestination&quot; texts which refer to the &quot;elect&quot; of God. </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Romans 8:28 &quot;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose. 29 For whom He did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. 30 Moreover whom He did predestinate, them He also called: and whom He called, them He also justified: and whom He justified, them He also glorified.&quot; </font></p>
        </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Who are those who are &quot;predestinated&quot; and whom God &quot;foreknew&quot;? They are &quot;all&quot; those who answer the &quot;call&quot; of God. These are the &quot;called&quot; of God, the &quot;elect ones&quot; who are of faith, of the Jew first and also of the Gentiles. Those who answer the &quot;call&quot; of God are among those who are &quot;predestinated&quot; to be saved because God &quot;foreknew&quot; that He would save &quot;all&quot; the &quot;elect&quot; who are of faith. Those who are saved by &quot;faith&quot; are those who are &quot;elected&quot; to eternal life. Those who seek to be saved by their obedience to the &quot;Law&quot; are like the unbelieving Jews who were ignorant of the righteousness of God and His holy Law and set about to justify themselves by their obedience to the Law. Those who seek to be accepted by God by being obedient to God's Law are predestined to be among the lost, because they fail to see their own unrighteousness. They are like the Laodiceans who think they are keeping God's Law, but are actually poor, blind, miserable, and naked. God has declared all to be &quot;prisoners of disobedience so that He might show mercy to them all&quot;.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">In summary, &quot;All&quot; repentant sinners who put their faith in the doing and dying of Jesus are &quot;predestined&quot; to be saved. While &quot;all&quot; who are trusting in their obedience and their own goodness are &quot;predestined&quot; to be lost. </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus 25 whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. 26 To declare, I say, at this time His righteousness: that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. 27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what Law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the Law. 29 Is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: 30 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. 31 Do we then make void the Law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the Law.&quot; Romans 3:24-31</font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">The doctrine of election is a joyous teaching. The problem with hyper-Calvinism is that it does not go far enough in its election teaching. Calvinism teaches that God has &quot;elected&quot; to save only certain chosen ones whom God chose from eternity to save while He has also elected to destroy some whom He has not &quot;elected&quot; to save. The truth is that God has consigned &quot;all&quot; to condemnation so that He might have mercy on &quot;all&quot; who believe. Christ is the light which lights EVERY man who comes into the world.</font></font></p>      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">John 1:6 &quot; John... came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that ALL MEN through him might believe. 8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. 9 That was the true Light, which lighteth EVERY MAN that cometh into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">The invitation and call of God is in all the world through the preaching of the Gospel, offering the free gift of forgiveness and eternal life through faith in Christ. The Holy Spirit calls and woes and urges all who hear to repent and believe. Those who hear are also enabled to believe even if they have only received the smallest rays of the light of the gospel of Christ. The pleading of the Holy Spirit is not &quot;irresistible&quot; though and for some strange mysterious reason that will never be understood, some choose darkness rather than light. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">There is no reason for unbelief, because to give a reason would be to offer an excuse for sin. There is no excuse for sin and unbelief, because it is the &quot;mystery of iniquity&quot;. This is a mystery that will never be explained. Thus the reason why some will choose sin and unbelief will never be understood. The Calvinists seek to unravel this mystery by saying that God simply did not &quot;give them faith&quot; to believe. The clear word of God rejects this Satanic reasoning however by clearly stating that the Gospel is so clear that they are all without excuse for not believing. The loss of a soul is the responsibility of the individual, and is not due to the lack of God's calling and the gift of faith. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">The Holy S</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">pirit's moving upon the hearts of all who hear the Gospel gives all the power in the world to the most sinful and degraded of men and women to believe, but the decision rests with the sinner whether to believe or not to believe. The prompting of the Holy Spirit gives the sinner freedom to believe. So long as our Lord intercedes in the heavenly sanctuary above, God's Holy Spirit will plead with those here below to repent and believe the gospel and be saved by the grace of God through faith in the sinless life and atoning death of our Lord Jesus Christ upon the cross of Calvary.</font></font></font></p>      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance. 13 The LORD looketh from heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men. 14 From the place of His habitation He looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. 15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; He considereth all their works. 16 There is no king saved by the multitude of a host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. 17 A horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. 18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear Him, upon them that hope in His mercy; 19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. 20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: He is our help and our shield. 21 For our heart shall rejoice in Him, because we have trusted in His Holy name. 22 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.&quot; Psalm 33:12-22 </font></p>
