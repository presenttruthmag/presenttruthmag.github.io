<p class="style1"><span class="style2">A Review of Desmond Ford's book, <em>Genesis Versus Darwin</em> </span></p>
<p class="style1">Hello brother Clifford Goldstein. </p>
<p class="style1">The publishers of <em>Spectrum</em> and <em>AToday</em> are leading their Adventist readers&nbsp;down the garden path to a total denial of even the basic teachings of the Bible. They put a humanist "interpretation" on every single teaching of fundamental Christian doctrine including the Genesis account of the six-day creation of the world. They even put their false humanistic interpretation&nbsp;upon the Christian doctrine&nbsp;of the vicarious penal substitutionary atonement of our Lord on the cross.&nbsp;To the liberal Adventists with their low view of the Bible, theistic humanism is the direction they wish to see the Adventist movement take and become "enlightened" enough to embrace. </p>
<p class="style1"><img src="94_XLIX_clip_image021.gif" align="left">I just finished reading Desmond Ford's book, <em>Genesis Versus Darwin</em> . He completely rejects the literal six day creation account of Genesis 1-11 and the chronology and historical events&nbsp;described therein, including&nbsp;the literal account of the Fall, the&nbsp;world-wide flood of Noah, the tower of Babel and the later account of Jonah as mere theistic allegory. He agrees with the secularist&nbsp;"scientific" community's&nbsp;time frame of 3 billion years of "God directed" progressive creation of the so-called lower forms of life and the final appearance of human beings (Adam)&nbsp;millions of years later.&nbsp;According to him this&nbsp;means that death and suffering have always been a part of the so-called&nbsp;"life and death" paradigm of life. For Ford, Genesis is merely a metaphor and therefore completely compatible with secular paleontology, geology, and anthropology. However, his explanation of the imagined billion year old geologic column has been completely blown out of the water by the geological events surrounding the 1980 volcanic eruption of Mount Saint Helens. This event laid down a "geologic column" in a matter of a couple of days not millions of years. </p>
<p class="style1">Throughout the book, Ford expresses&nbsp;his&nbsp;pity for&nbsp;the poor benighted Adventists like Ellen White&nbsp;who take Genesis history as literal history.&nbsp; Unfortunately many if not most of the Adventist educators in academia are leaning this way albeit covertly in many instances. I debated an anthropology professor at Loma Linda, Dr. Sterling, a few years ago who openly advocated progressive creationism and theistic evolution as "fact" and that Genesis must be taken as metaphor and allegory. These people all claim to defend "sola scriptura", but then claim that the reader must allow for an "interpretation" that allows for the so-called "ignorance" of "early Man". Thus, Adam and Eve are metaphor. The sinless / deathless Garden of Eden is a metaphor. The satanic Serpent is a metaphor. The Curses pronounced by God are mere metaphor. The 24 hour day of the six day creation is mere metaphor representing billions of years. </p>
<p class="style1">Our Lord asked, "When the Son of Man appears will He find faith in the earth?"-----not among the followers of the likes of Desmond Ford and the other false prophets of the Antichrist ecumenical movement. If they do not repent, they will all be deceived by what they propose to be "the Spirit Ethic" that is breathed upon them by the Spiritualism of Satan's masterpiece of deception.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">There will only be two classes of people in the coming crisis. The one class will be those who worship the true Christ who is in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary pleading the benefits of His shed blood before the holy Law of God for the justification of His repentant people. These will receive the final seal of God's approval. The other class will be worshipping a false "christ" who himself claims to be a god who can over-rule the clear teachings of God's word and put in its place the lies and misrepresentations of the Prince of Darkness. These will receive the final mark of the deceiver, the apostate "liar from the beginning". </p>
<p class="style1">Soon Satan himself will make his final appearance to deceive the whole world and if possible even the very elect of God. God bless the Seventh-day Adventist movement and the message of the 3 angels of Revelation 14. Here are they who keep the commandments of God and put their faith in the blood of the Savior for their forgiveness and acceptance before God's holy Law. On the Last Day, they will look up at the splendor of their coming Savior and say, "Lo, this is our God. We have waited for Him and He will save us!!" </p>
