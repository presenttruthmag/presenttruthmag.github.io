      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><br>
            </b><font size="3"> The entire body of doctrine of the Christian Church is built upon unshakable faith in the veracity of word of God, the Bible. If one loses faith in the Bible as the word of God, then all is lost for that person. The Bible answers the most basic questions that reach to the very core of Man's being&#8212;who are we? where do we come from? what are we doing here? and where are we going? There are men and women who spend their entire lifetime searching out the answers to these questions. They literally travel the farthest seas, climb the highest mountains, and explore the depths of the deepest abyss to find the meaning to these profound questions. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Yet as the Bible says, &quot;But the righteousness which is by faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? ... Or, Who shall descend into the deep? ....But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach.&quot; Paul is thus proclaiming that in the Gospel is found all the answers to all of our most profound questionings.<br>
      
            <br>
            Only those who have been totally consumed by this search for these answers will, when they find Jesus Christ and the Gospel of justification by grace through faith in His sinless life and atoning death, sell all that they have to buy the field in which they find the Pearl of great price!! </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.&quot; Matt13:45.</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Is it any wonder that Satan's fiercest attacks are upon the authority and integrity of the word of God? Constantly in the modern media and even within the Church we hear the subtle question, &quot;Yea hath God REALLY said....?&quot; Was the world REALLY created in 6 literal days? Did Adam and Eve REALLY live and did they REALLY fall into sin by eating a simple bite of the forbidden fruit? Did the miracles of the Old Testament REALLY happen? Was Jesus Christ REALLY God in the flesh who lived a sinless life and died for the sins of the world in our place? Did the Holy Spirit REALLY inspire the authors of the New Testament and direct in the compilation of the New Testament canon? And of course there is the one question that continuously comes up , Did God REALLY raise up the Protestant reformation to make the final repairs in the rebuilding of the Temple of God by restoring the harmony, yet distinction, of the Law of God and the Gospel of Jesus Christ?<br>
          
            <br>
              As we approach the final conflict with the wrath of the Dragon, there can be only one weapon in our hand, the word of God. It is sharper than any two edged sword and is the only defense for the remnant people. &quot;IT IS WRITTEN that Man does not live by bread alone, but by EVERY word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.&quot; </font><b><br>
