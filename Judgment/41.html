              <p><br>
              <font face="Arial" size="3">We must always be exceedingly careful not to equate the &quot;breath of life&quot;, which all living creatures possess, with the Holy Spirit which attends the proclamation of the gospel of Christ and infills those who repent and believe in the saving merits of the doing and dying of Christ as our substitute upon the Cross. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This is the error that E. J. Waggoner made in his form of pantheism that claimed that all life contained the Holy Spirit and that Christ's person was contained and revealed in all living and even inanimate creation. Kellogg also took this form of pantheism which saw salvation as simply becoming aware or &quot;enlightened&quot; to the &quot;fact&quot; that the Holy Spirit is already in us and all around us in creation and those so &quot;enlightened&quot; should be giving glory to God for living in us and all living things. To their dying day neither Kellogg nor Waggoner admitted that their understanding of salvation was incorrect. They claimed that this was good old salvation by God living in us that Christians call sanctification.<br>
              <br>
              This is why they denied the existence of the heavenly sanctuary where we need the mediation of Christ to add His merit to our imperfect lives. To them all atonement took place in the heart of the believer and &quot;no legal book-work&quot; justification by imputed righteousness needed to take place in heaven before the Law of God.<br>
              <br>
              On a similar vein, their pantheism is very similar to the view that is still prevalent in Christian church today by those who reject the &quot;forensic&quot; view of justification by faith by falsely portraying it as being &quot;legalistic&quot;. The truth is that while our justification before our holy God is based upon Christ's &quot;legal&quot; right to be our Mediator due to His sinless life and atoning death upon the Cross, we are not justified by &quot;legalism&quot;. Legalism is to seek to be justified or accepted by ones good works and success at keeping God's Law. There is no one but Jesus who ever met all the broadest demands of the Law of God for perfect holiness and constant unselfish love to God and fellow man. It is only those who think that they do not need the imputed merit of Christ to stand before a holy God who are being &quot;legalistic&quot;, because they think they can come before God without faith in the &quot;blood&quot; of Christ's imputed sinless life and atoning death upon Calvary. They claim that because God is &quot;gracious&quot; that He can forgive sinners without a Substitute to meet the demands of God holy Law. Many will realize only too late that they need that &quot;legal&quot; merit of Christ to stand before God when He comes in the undimmed glory and splendor and brightness of the Son of Man. No man can come before God without a &quot;blood&quot; sacrifice to sprinkle its merit and imputed righteousness upon the conscience of those who will stand on that final Day.<br>
              <br>
              Those who reject the blood atonement of our Lord upon Calvary will stand in the shame of their nakedness on that Day. God's blessings upon all.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><br>
