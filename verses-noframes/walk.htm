<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom. 13:13</i></font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>3 John 3, 4</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified of the truth [that] [is] in you, just as you <strong>walk</strong> in the truth. 4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children <strong>walk</strong> in truth.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 John 4-6</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 I rejoiced greatly that I have found [some] of your children <strong>walking</strong> in truth, as we received commandment from the Father. 5 And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another. 6 This is love, that we <strong>walk</strong> according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should <strong>walk</strong> in it.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 John 1:6-7</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and <strong>walk</strong> in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. 7 But if we <strong>walk</strong> in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.<br>
