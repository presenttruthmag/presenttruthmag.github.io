<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Matthew 10:28 </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather<strong> fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. </strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Luke 12:1-5 </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known. 3 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops. 4 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. 5 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: <strong>Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. </strong></font><br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Luke 12:47-49</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">47 &quot;And that servant who knew his master's will, and did not prepare himself or do according to his will, shall be <strong>beaten</strong> with many stripes. 48 &quot;But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be <strong>beaten</strong> with few. For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been committed, of him they will ask the more. 49 &quot; I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Pet. 2:9-14</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under <strong>punishment</strong> for the day of judgment, 10 and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. They are presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries, 11 whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord. 12 But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in their own corruption, 13 and will receive the wages of unrighteousness, as those who count it pleasure to carouse in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, carousing in their own deceptions while they feast with you, 14 having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls. They have a heart trained in covetous practices, and are accursed children.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Th. 1:9</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 These shall be <strong>punished</strong> with everlasting <strong>destruction</strong> from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt. 25:46</i></font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
Heb. 10:29</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">29 Of how much worse <strong>punishment</strong>, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace?</font></p>

Romans 1:18-32</em></strong>  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 For the <strong>wrath</strong> of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,  19 because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them.  20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse,  21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 Professing to be wise, they became fools,  23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man -- and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.  24 Therefore God also gave them up to <strong>uncleanness</strong>, in the <strong>lusts</strong> of their hearts, to <strong>dishonor their bodies among themselves, </strong>25 who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 For this reason God gave them up to <strong>vile passions.</strong> For <strong>even their women</strong> exchanged the natural use for what is <strong>against nature. </strong>27 Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, <strong>burned in their lust for one another</strong>, men with <strong>men committing what is shameful</strong>, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.  28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a <strong>debased mind</strong>, to do those things which are not fitting;  29 being filled with all unrighteousness, <strong>sexual immorality,</strong> wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers,  30 backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  31 undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful;  32 who, knowing the <strong>righteous judgment of God</strong>, that those who practice such things are <strong>deserving of death</strong>, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em><br>
        <br>
Ephesians 5:5-6</em></strong>   </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.  6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the<strong> wrath of God </strong>comes upon the sons   of disobedience. <br>
