<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rev. 12:14</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 But the <strong>woman</strong> was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 10:16</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 &quot;And other sheep I have which are not of this <strong>fold</strong>; them also I must bring, and they will hear My voice; and there will be one <strong>flock</strong> and one shepherd.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Heb. 12:22-24</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, 23 to the <strong>general assembly </strong>and <strong>church of the firstborn</strong> who are registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, 24 to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Eph. 5:23-27</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the <strong>body</strong>. 24 Therefore, just as the <strong>church</strong> is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. 25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the <strong>church</strong> and gave Himself for her, 26 that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, 27 that He might present her to Himself a glorious <strong>church</strong>, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Luke 10:20</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 &quot;Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because <strong>your names are written in heaven</strong>.&quot;<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Phil. 4:3</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 And I urge you also, true companion, help these women who labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose <strong>names are in the Book of Life</strong>.<br>
