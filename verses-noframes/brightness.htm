<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall <strong>consume</strong> with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the <strong>brightness of his coming</strong>: 9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: 12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2 Peter 3:7-10 </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, <strong>reserved unto fire</strong> against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. 8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall <strong>melt with fervent heat</strong>, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be <strong>burned up</strong>. </font></p>
