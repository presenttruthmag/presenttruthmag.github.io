<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Luke 18:9-14</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 10 &quot;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 &quot;The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, `God, I thank You that I am not like other men--extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector. 12 `I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.' 13 &quot;And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, `God, be merciful to me a sinner!' 14 &quot;I tell you, this man went down to his house <strong>justified</strong> rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&quot;<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom. 3:20-28 30</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be <strong>justified</strong> in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. 21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 24 Being <strong>justified freely</strong> by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. 27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is <strong>justified</strong> by faith apart from the deeds of the law. .....30 since [there] [is] one God who will <strong>justify</strong> the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.</font></p>

Rom. 4:5</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 But to him who does not work but believes on Him who <strong>justifies</strong> the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness, </font></p>

      <strong>Rom. 5:1-2, 6-9</strong></i> <br>
  <br>
  1 Therefore, having been <strong>justified</strong> by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 6 For while we were yet weak, in due season Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die. 8 But God commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, being now <strong>justified</strong> by his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath of God through him.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Gal 2:16</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 &quot;knowing that a man is not <strong>justified</strong> by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be <strong>justified</strong> by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be <strong>justified</strong>. </font></p>
