 Hebrews 1:1-3 </em></strong></p>
 <p><span class="style2">1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, 2 Hath in these <strong>last days</strong> spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; 3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</span><br>

 <p class="style2"><strong><em>Acts 2:14-18</em></strong></p>
 <p><span class="style2"> 14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: 15 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. 16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; 17 And it shall come to pass in the<strong> last days</strong>, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: 18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</span><br>
