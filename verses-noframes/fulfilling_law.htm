<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt 5:17-19</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 &quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to <strong>fulfill</strong>. 18 &quot;For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the<strong> law till all is fulfilled.</strong> 19 &quot;Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><br>
James 2:8-12 </strong></em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 If ye <strong>fulfil the royal law</strong> according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the <strong>law</strong> as transgressors. 10 For whosoever shall keep the whole <strong>law</strong>, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. 11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the <strong>law</strong>. 12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be <strong>judged by the law of liberty.</strong></font></p>
