<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Gen 3:1-5</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, &quot;Has God indeed said, 'You shall not eat of every tree of the garden'?&quot; 2 And the woman said to the serpent, &quot;We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; 3 &quot;but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.' &quot; 4 Then the serpent said to the woman, &quot;You will not surely die. 5 &quot;For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and <strong>you will be like God,</strong> knowing good and evil.&quot; <br>
