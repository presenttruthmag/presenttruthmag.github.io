<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong>Acts 20:20-21 </strong></em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, 21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, <strong>repentance toward God</strong>, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Luke 18:10-14</em></strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. 12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. 13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, <strong>God be merciful to me a sinner.</strong> 14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and <strong>he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. </strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
Acts 2:38</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then Peter said to them, &quot;<strong>Repent</strong>, and let every one of you <strong>be baptized</strong> in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Luke 24:46, 47</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">46 Then He said to them, &quot;Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, 47 &quot;and that <strong>repentance</strong> and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Acts 3:19</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 &quot;<strong>Repent</strong> therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em><br>
  Heb 9:14 </em></strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from <strong>dead works</strong> to serve the living God? </font></p>
