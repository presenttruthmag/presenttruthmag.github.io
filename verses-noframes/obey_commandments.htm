<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Mark 10:17-22</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 Now as He was going out on the road, one came running, knelt before Him, and asked Him, &quot;Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?&quot; 18 So Jesus said to him, &quot;Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. 19 &quot;You know the <strong>commandments</strong>: 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not murder,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not bear false witness,' 'Do not defraud,' 'Honor your father and your mother.' &quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 And he answered and said to Him, &quot;Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth.&quot; 21 Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, &quot;One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.&quot; 22 But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.<br>
</font> </p>
<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Mark 12:28-34</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">28 Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, &quot;Which is the first <strong>commandment</strong> of all?&quot; 29 Jesus answered him, &quot;The first of all the <strong>commandments</strong> is: 'Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is one. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">30 'And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the first commandment. 31 &quot;And the second, like it, is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other <strong>commandment</strong> greater than these.&quot; 32 So the scribe said to Him, &quot;Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but He. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">33 &quot;And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.&quot; 34 Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, &quot;You are not far from the kingdom of God.&quot; But after that no one dared question Him.<br>

<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Cor 7:19</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but <strong>keeping the commandments of God </strong>is what matters.<br>
</font> </p>
<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 John 5:2-3</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when <strong>we love God and keep His commandments</strong>. 3 For this is the love of God, that <strong>we keep His commandments</strong>. And <strong>His commandments are not burdensome.<br>
</strong></font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Rev 12:17</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who <strong>keep the commandments of God </strong>and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> </p>
<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt 5:17-19</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 &quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. 18 &quot;For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. 19 &quot;<strong>Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;</strong> but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br>
</font> </p>
<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Dan 9:4-5</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 And I prayed to the LORD my God, and made confession, and said, &quot;O Lord, great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and mercy <strong>with those who love Him, and with those who keep His commandments</strong>, 5 &quot;we have sinned and committed iniquity, we have done wickedly and rebelled, even by departing from Your precepts and Your judgments.<br>
</font> </p>
<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Isa 48:18</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oh, that you had <strong>heeded My commandments</strong>! Then your peace would have been like a river, And your righteousness like the waves of the sea.<br>
</font> </p>
<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Ecl 12:13</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:<strong> Fear God and keep His commandments, For this is man's all.</strong><br>
</font> </p>
<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Prov 10:8</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wise in heart will receive <strong>commands</strong>, But a prating fool will fall.<br>
</font> </p>
<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Prov 7:1-2</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 My son, keep my words, And treasure my commands within you. 2 <strong>Keep my commands and live, And my law as the apple of your eye. <br>
