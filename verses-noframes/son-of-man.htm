<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Dan. 7:13</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 &quot;I was watching in the night visions, And behold, [One] like the <strong>Son of Man,</strong> Coming with the clouds of heaven! He came to the Ancient of Days, And they brought Him near before Him.<br>

</font><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt. 9:6</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 &quot;But that you may know that the <strong>Son of Man</strong> has power on earth to forgive sins&quot;--then He said to the paralytic, &quot;Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.&quot;</font></p>

  <em><strong>Luke 17:24 &quot;</strong></em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For just as the lightning, when it flashes out of one part of the sky, shines to the other part of the sky, so will the <strong>Son of Man</strong> be in His day.<br>

  <em><strong>John 3:13-14 </strong> </em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And no one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended from heaven, even the <strong>Son of Man</strong>. 14 &quot;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the <strong>Son of Man</strong> be lifted up;</font></p>
