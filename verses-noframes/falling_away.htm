2 Thessalonians 2: 3-4</em></strong></p>
<p><span class="style1">3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a <strong>falling away</strong> first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; 4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. </span></p>
<p><span class="style4"><br>
Acts 20: 29-31</span></p>
<p><span class="style1"> 29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to <strong>draw away </strong>disciples after them. 31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.<br>
