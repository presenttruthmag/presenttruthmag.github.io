<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not <strong>war</strong> according to the flesh. 4 For the weapons of our <strong>warfare</strong> [are] not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, 6 and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.<br>
