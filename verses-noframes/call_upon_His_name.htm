<p class="style1 style2">Call upon His name</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Genesis 4:25-26<br>
</strong>And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: <strong>then began men to call upon the name of the LORD</strong>. </p>
<p class="style1"><strong>1 Chronicles 16:8-10</strong> <br>
Give thanks unto the LORD, <strong>call upon his name</strong>, make known his deeds among the people. 9 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works. 10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. </p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Psalm 18:3</strong> <br>
  <strong>I will call upon the LORD</strong>, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. </p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Psalm 50:14-15</strong> <br>
Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High: 15 And <strong>call upon me in the day of trouble</strong>: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Psalm 55:16-17</strong> <br>
As for me, <strong>I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me</strong>. 17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Psalm 86:3-7</strong> <br> 
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily. 4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 5<strong> For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee</strong>. 6 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. 7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. </p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Psalm 145:18-20</strong> <br>
The LORD is nigh unto all them that <strong>call upon him</strong>, to all that <strong>call upon him in truth</strong>. 19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them. 20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy. </p>
<p class="style1"><em><strong>Romans 10:8-13<br>
</strong></em>The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead,<strong> thou shalt be saved.</strong> 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. 13 For <strong>whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. </strong></p>
<p class="style1"><strong>1 Corinthians 1:2 <br>
</strong>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place<strong> call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord</strong>, both theirs and ours:</p>
