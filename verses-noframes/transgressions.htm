1 John 3:3-10</strong></p>
<p class="style1">3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. 4 <strong>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law</strong>: for <strong>sin is the transgression of the law</strong>. 5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. 6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. 7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 8 <strong>He that committeth sin is of the devil</strong>; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><br>
  Romans 7:7-12</strong></p>
<p class="style1">7 What shall we say then? <strong>Is the law sin?</strong> God forbid. Nay, <strong>I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</strong> 8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. 9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. 10 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. 11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. 12 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.<br>
