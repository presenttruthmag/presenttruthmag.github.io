<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Likewise <strong>deacons</strong> must be reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for money, 9 holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience. 10 But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being [found] blameless. 11 Likewise their wives must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things. 12 Let <strong>deacons</strong> be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. 13 For those who have served well as <strong>deacons</strong> obtain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</font></p>
