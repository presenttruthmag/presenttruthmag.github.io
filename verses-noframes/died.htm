<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 He was taken from prison and from judgment, And who will declare His generation? For He was cut off from the land of the living; For the transgressions of My people He was stricken. 9 And they made His grave with the wicked-- But with the rich at His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor [was] [any] deceit in His mouth. </font></p>

Rom. 5:6-8</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ <strong>died</strong> for the ungodly. 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one <strong>die</strong>; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. 8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ <strong>died</strong> for us. </font></p>
