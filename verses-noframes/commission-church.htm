<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt. 28:18-19</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, &quot;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 19 &quot;<strong>Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations</strong>, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Luke 24:46-49</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">46 Then He said to them, &quot;Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, 47 &quot;and that repentance and remission of sins should be <strong>preached in His name to all nations,</strong> beginning at Jerusalem. 48 &quot;And you are witnesses of these things. 49 &quot;Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high.&quot;<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Mark 16:15-16</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 And He said to them, &quot;<strong>Go into all the world </strong>and preach the gospel to every creature. 16 &quot;He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 20:21-23</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 So Jesus said to them again, &quot;Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.&quot; 22 And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, &quot;Receive the Holy Spirit. 23 &quot;If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&quot;<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Acts 1:8</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 &quot;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be <strong>witnesses</strong> to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and <strong>to the end of the earth.</strong>&quot;<br>
