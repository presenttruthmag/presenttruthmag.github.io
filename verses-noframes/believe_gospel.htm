<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 1:12</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who <strong>believe</strong> in His name: </font></p>

  <br>
but these are written that you may <strong>believe</strong> that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that <strong>believing</strong> you may have life in His name. </font> </p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
Romans 10:9-13</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and <strong>believe</strong> in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one <strong>believes</strong> unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, "Whoever <strong>believes</strong> on Him will not be put to shame." 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For "whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved." </font> </p>

1 Cor 1:21, 23, 30</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who <strong>believe</strong>. . . . . 23 but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness, . . . .30 But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God--and righteousness and sanctification and redemption-- <br>
