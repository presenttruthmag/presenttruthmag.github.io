<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; 15 and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again. . . . .17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.<br>
