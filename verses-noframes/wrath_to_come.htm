<p class="style1 style2">Wrath to Come</p>
<p class="style1"><em><strong>Romans 1:18 - 2:2 </strong></em></p>
<p class="style1">18 For the <strong>wrath of God</strong> is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, 19 because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. 20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, 21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man -- and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things. 24 Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, 25 who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. </p>
<p class="style1">26 For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. 27 Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their <strong>lust for one another,</strong> men with men committing what is <strong>shameful</strong>, and receiving in themselves the <strong>penalty</strong> of their error which was due. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; 29 being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, 30 backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31 undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; 32 who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are <strong>deserving of death</strong>, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them.  Romans 2:1 Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are who judge, for in whatever you judge another you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things. 2 But we know that the <strong>judgment of God </strong>is according to truth against those who practice such things. </p>
<p class="style1"><em><strong><br>
1 Thessalonians 1:9-10 </strong></em></p>
<p class="style1">...you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God, 10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, <strong>Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come. </strong></p>
<p class="style1"><strong><br>
    <em>Matthew 3:7-8 7 </em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, &quot;O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from <strong>the wrath to come</strong>? 8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.&quot;</p>
<p class="style1"><br>
  <em><strong>Revelation 6:14-17</strong></em> </p>
<p class="style1"> And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. 15 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; 16 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from<strong> the wrath of the Lamb:</strong> 17 For the great <strong>day of his wrath</strong> is come; and who shall be able to stand?</p>
<p class="style1"><em><strong><br>
Psalm 2:4-12 </strong></em></p>
<p class="style1"> He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. 5 Then shall he speak unto them in <strong>his wrath</strong>, and vex them in his sore displeasure. 6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. 7 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. 8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. 9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel. 10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when <strong>his wrath is kindled</strong> but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p>
