<p class="style2"><strong><em>John 7:16-17</em></strong></p>
<p><span class="style2">16  Jesus answered them, and said, My <strong>doctrine</strong> is not mine, but his that sent me. 17 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the <strong>doctrine</strong>, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</span></p>
<p class="style2"><strong><em><br>
Acts 2: 41-42 </em></strong></p>
<p><span class="style2">41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. 42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' <strong>doctrine</strong> and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><br>
  <span class="style2">Romans 6:17</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="style2">17 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of <strong>doctrine</strong> which was delivered you.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong><br>
  <em>Romans 16:17</em> </strong></p>
<p class="style2">17 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the <strong>doctrine</strong> which ye have learned; and avoid them.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong><em><br>
Ephesians 4:11-15</em></strong></p>
<p class="style2">11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of <strong>doctrine</strong>, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:</p>
<p class="style2"><strong><em><br>
1 Timothy 1:3</em></strong></p>
<p class="style2"> 3 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other <strong>doctrine</strong>,</p>
<p class="style2"><strong><br>
  <em>1 Timothy 4:6-7,13,16</em></strong></p>
<p class="style2">6 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good <strong>doctrine</strong>, whereunto thou hast attained. 7 But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness......13 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to <strong>doctrine</strong>......16 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the <strong>doctrine</strong>; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong><em><br>
1 Timothy 5:17</em></strong></p>
<p class="style2">17 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and <strong>doctrine</strong>.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong><em><br>
2 Timothy 4:1-5 </em></strong></p>
<p class="style2">1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; 2 <strong>Preach</strong> the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and <strong>doctrine</strong>. 3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound <strong>doctrine</strong>; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; 4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. 5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong><em><br>
  Titus 1: 
9-11</em></strong></p>
<p class="style2">9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound <strong>doctrine</strong> both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. 10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: 11 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong><em><br>
2 John 7-10</em></strong></p>
<p class="style2">7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. 8 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. 9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the <strong>doctrine</strong> of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the <strong>doctrine</strong> of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. 10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this <strong>doctrine</strong>, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</p>
