<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 &quot;Know therefore and understand, That from the going forth of the <strong>command</strong> To restore and build Jerusalem Until Messiah the Prince, There shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; The street shall be built again, and the wall, Even in troublesome times.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 Thus says <strong>Cyrus king of Persia</strong>: All the kingdoms of the earth the Lord God of heaven has given me. And He has <strong>commanded</strong> me to build Him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah. 3 Who is among you of all His people? May his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel (He is God), which is in Jerusalem. 4 And whoever is left in any place where he dwells, let the men of his place help him with silver and gold, with goods and livestock, besides the freewill offerings for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Then <strong>Darius</strong> the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. 2 And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written: 3 In the first year of <strong>King Cyrus</strong>, King Cyrus issued a <strong>decree</strong> concerning the house of God at Jerusalem: &quot;Let the house be rebuilt, the place where they offered sacrifices; and let the foundations of it be firmly laid, its height sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits, </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 with three rows of heavy stones and one row of new timber. Let the expenses be paid from the king's treasury. 5 Also let the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple which is in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and taken back to the temple which is in Jerusalem, each to its place; and deposit them in the house of God&quot;-- 6 Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the region beyond the River, and Shethar-Boznai, and your companions the Persians who are beyond the River, keep yourselves far from there. 7 Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Moreover I issue a decree as to what you shall do for the elders of these Jews, for the building of this house of God: Let the cost be paid at the king's expense from taxes on the region beyond the River; this is to be given immediately to these men, so that they are not hindered. 9 And whatever they need--young bulls, rams, and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the request of the priests who are in Jerusalem--let it be given them day by day without fail, 10 that they may offer sacrifices of sweet aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and his sons. 11 Also I issue a <strong>decree</strong> that whoever alters this edict, let a timber be pulled from his house and erected, and let him be hanged on it; and let his house be made a refuse heap because of this. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 And may the God who causes His name to dwell there destroy any king or people who put their hand to alter it, or to destroy this house of God which is in Jerusalem. I <strong>Darius</strong> issue a <strong>decree</strong>; let it be done diligently.....14 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and <strong>according to the commandment</strong> of <strong>Cyrus</strong>, and <strong>Darius</strong>, and <strong>Artaxerxes</strong> king of Persia. <br>

<p><strong><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ezra 7:12-26</font></i>
</strong>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 <strong>Artaxerxes, king of kings</strong>, To Ezra the priest, a scribe of the Law of the God of heaven: Perfect peace, and so forth. 13 I issue a <strong>decree</strong> that all those of the people of Israel and the priests and Levites in my realm, who volunteer to go up to Jerusalem, may go with you. 14 And whereas you are being sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, with regard to the Law of your God which is in your hand; </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 and whereas you are to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem; 16 and whereas all the silver and gold that you may find in all the province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering of the people and the priests, are to be freely offered for the house of their God in Jerusalem&#8212;17 now therefore, be careful to buy with this money bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them on the altar of the house of your God in Jerusalem. 18 And whatever seems good to you and your brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do it according to the will of your God. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 Also the articles that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem. 20 And whatever more may be needed for the house of your God, which you may have occasion to provide, pay for it from the king's treasury. 21 And I, even I, <strong>Artaxerxes the king,</strong> issue a <strong>decree</strong> to all the treasurers who are in the region beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, may require of you, let it be done diligently, 22 up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred kors of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribed limit. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it diligently be done for the house of the God of heaven. For why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? 24 Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tax, tribute, or custom on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 And you, Ezra, according to your God-given wisdom, set magistrates and judges who may judge all the people who are in the region beyond the River, all such as know the laws of your God; and teach those who do not know them. 26 Whoever will not observe the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily on him, whether it be death, or banishment, or confiscation of goods, or imprisonment.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of <strong>King Artaxerxes</strong>, when wine was before him, that I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence before. 2 Therefore the king said to me, &quot;Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing but sorrow of heart.&quot; So I became dreadfully afraid, 3 and said to the king, &quot;May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' tombs, lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire?&quot; 4 Then the king said to me, &quot;What do you request?&quot; So I prayed to the God of heaven. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 And I said to the king, &quot;If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may rebuild it.&quot; 6 Then the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), &quot;How long will your journey be? And when will you return?&quot; So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. 7 Furthermore I said to the king, &quot;If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the governors of the region beyond the River, that they must permit me to pass through till I come to Judah, </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 &quot;and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he must give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel which [pertains] to the temple, for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy.&quot; And the king granted them to me according to the good hand of my God upon me.</font>
