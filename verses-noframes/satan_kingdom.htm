<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 Then the <strong>devil</strong>, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the <strong>kingdoms</strong> of the world in a moment of time. 6 And the <strong>devil</strong> said to Him, &quot;All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for this has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. 7 &quot;Therefore, if You will worship before me, all will be Yours.&quot; 8 And Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;Get behind Me, <strong>Satan</strong>! For it is written, 'You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve.' &quot; <br>
