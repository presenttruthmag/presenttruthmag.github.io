<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Titus 3:4-7</i> </font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared, 5 not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, 6 whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. <br>

<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1John 4:7-16</i> </font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.8 He who does not love does not know God, for <strong>God is love</strong>. 9 In this <strong>the love of God</strong> was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him. 10 In this is love, not that we loved God, but that <strong>He loved us</strong> and sent His Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if <strong>God so loved us</strong>, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son [as] Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 16 And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>John 3:16-18</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &quot;For <strong>God so loved the world</strong> that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 &quot;For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. 18 &quot;He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>Rom 5:5</strong></i> <br>
  <br>
  5 Now hope does not disappoint, because <strong>the love of God</strong> has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us. <br>
