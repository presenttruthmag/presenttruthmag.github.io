<p class="style1 style2">Second Commandment</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em><br>
Exodus 20:4-6 </em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">4 &quot;You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; 5 you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, 6 but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.&quot;</p>
