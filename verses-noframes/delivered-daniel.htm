<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Dan. 6:16-23, 26-27</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 So the king gave the command, and they brought Daniel and cast [him] into the den of lions. [But] the king spoke, saying to Daniel, &quot;Your God, whom you serve continually, He will deliver you.&quot; 17 Then a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signets of his lords, that the purpose concerning Daniel might not be changed. 18 Now the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no musicians were brought before him. Also his sleep went from him. 19 Then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 And when he came to the den, he cried out with a lamenting voice to Daniel. The king spoke, saying to Daniel, &quot;Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to <strong>deliver</strong> you from the lions?&quot; 21 Then Daniel said to the king, &quot;O king, live forever! 22 &quot;My God sent His angel and shut the lions' mouths, so that they have not hurt me, because I was found innocent before Him; and also, O king, I have done no wrong before you.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 Then the king was exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no injury whatever was found on him, because he believed in his God. . . . . </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom [men] [must] tremble and fear before the God of Daniel. For He [is] the living God, And steadfast forever; His kingdom [is] [the] [one] which shall not be destroyed, And His dominion [shall] [endure] to the end. 27 He <strong>delivers</strong> and rescues, And He works signs and wonders In heaven and on earth, Who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.<br>
