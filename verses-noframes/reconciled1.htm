<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has <strong>reconciled</strong> 22 in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight-- 23 if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was preached to every creature under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor 5:18-21</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 Now all things are of God, who has <strong>reconciled</strong> us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of <strong>reconciliation</strong>, 19 that is, that God was in Christ <strong>reconciling</strong> the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of <strong>reconciliation</strong>. 20 Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ's behalf, be <strong>reconciled</strong> to God. 21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. <br>
