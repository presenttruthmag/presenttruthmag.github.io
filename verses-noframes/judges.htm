<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 Nevertheless, the Lord raised up <strong>judges</strong> who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them. 17 Yet they would not listen to their judges, but they played the harlot with other gods, and bowed down to them. They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers walked, in obeying the commandments of the Lord; they did not do so. 18 And when the Lord raised up <strong>judges</strong> for them, the Lord was with the <strong>judge</strong> and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the <strong>judge</strong>; for the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed them and harassed them.<br>
