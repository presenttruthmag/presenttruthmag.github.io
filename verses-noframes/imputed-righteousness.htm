<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God <strong>imputes righteousness </strong>apart from works:. . . . 11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are uncircumcised, that <strong>righteousness might be imputed</strong> to them also, . . . . 22 And therefore &quot;it was accounted to him for righteousness.&quot; </font></p>
