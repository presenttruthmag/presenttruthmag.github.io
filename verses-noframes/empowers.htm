<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Ps. 51:10-12</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 Create in me a clean heart, O God, And <strong>renew</strong> a steadfast spirit within me. 11 Do not cast me away from Your presence, And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. 12 <strong>Restore</strong> to me the joy of Your salvation, And <strong>uphold</strong> me by Your generous Spirit.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Eph. 3:16-21</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be <strong>strengthened</strong> with might through His Spirit in the inner man, 17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what [is] the width and length and depth and height-- 19 to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. 20 Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the <strong>power that works in us</strong>, 21 to Him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor. 12:9-10</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 And He said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you, for <strong>My strength</strong> is made perfect in weakness.&quot; Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the<strong> power of Christ may rest upon me</strong>. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Th. 1:11-12</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness and the work of faith <strong>with power</strong>, 12 that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</font></p>
