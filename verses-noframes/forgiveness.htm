  </i>9 Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 10 &quot;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 &quot;The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, `God, I thank You that I am not like other men--extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector. 12 `I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.' 13 &quot;And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, <strong>saying, `God, be merciful to me a sinner!'</strong> 14 &quot;I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&quot; </font></p>
