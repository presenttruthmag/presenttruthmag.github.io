<p class="style1">Noah's Flood </p>
<p><span class="style3"><em><strong>Genesis 6:5 &#8212; 9:29</strong></em> </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">5 And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 7 And <strong>the LORD said, I will destroy man</strong> whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. 8 But <strong>Noah</strong> found grace in the eyes of the LORD. </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">9 These are the generations of <strong>Noah</strong>: <strong>Noah</strong> was a just man and perfect in his generations, and <strong>Noah</strong> walked with God. 10 And <strong>Noah</strong> begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">13 And God said unto <strong>Noah</strong>, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold,<strong> I will destroy them with the earth.</strong> 14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.....</span></p>
<p><span class="style3">17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring <strong>a flood of waters upon the earth</strong>, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die. 18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. 19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.....</span></p>
<p><span class="style3">22 Thus did <strong>Noah</strong>; according to all that God commanded him, so did he. </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">Genesis 7:1 And the LORD said unto <strong>Noah</strong>, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.....</span></p>
<p><span class="style3"> 4 For yet seven days, and <strong>I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights</strong>; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. 5 And <strong>Noah</strong> did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. 6 And <strong>Noah</strong> was six hundred years old when<strong> the flood of waters was upon the earth.....</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="style3"> 10 And it came to pass after seven days, that<strong> the waters of the flood </strong>were upon the earth. 11 In the six hundredth year of <strong>Noah's</strong> life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were <strong>all the fountains of the great deep broken up</strong>, and <strong>the windows of heaven were opened</strong>. 12 And the <strong>rain</strong> was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 13 In the selfsame day entered <strong>Noah</strong>, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort..... </span></p>
<p><span class="style3"> 17 And<strong> the flood </strong>was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 18 And the <strong>waters prevailed</strong>, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and <strong>the ark went upon the face of the waters</strong>. 19 And <strong>the waters</strong> prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. 20 Fifteen cubits upward did <strong>the waters </strong>prevail; and the mountains were covered. 21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. 23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and <strong>Noah</strong> only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. 24 And <strong>the waters </strong>prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">Genesis 8:1 And God remembered <strong>Noah</strong>, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; 2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 3 And <strong>the waters </strong>returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. 4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 5 And <strong>the waters </strong>decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that <strong>Noah</strong> opened the window of the ark which he had made: 7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. 10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and <strong>Noah</strong> removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. 14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">15 And God spake unto <strong>Noah</strong>, saying, 16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. 17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">18 And <strong>Noah</strong> went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">20 And <strong>Noah</strong> builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. 22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">Genesis 9:1 And God blessed <strong>Noah</strong> and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. 3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. 6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. 8 And God spake unto <strong>Noah</strong>, and to his sons with him, saying, 9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 11 And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. 17 And God said unto <strong>Noah</strong>, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth..... </span></p>
<p><span class="style3">29 And all the days of <strong>Noah</strong> were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.</span><span class="style1"><br>
