<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 (NKJV) Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 He laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is [the] Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then [I] [saw] the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received [his] mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This [is] the first resurrection. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 Blessed and holy [is] he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number [is] as the sand of the sea. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet [are]. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is [the] [Book] of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, &quot;Behold, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them [and] [be] their God. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 &quot;And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 Then He who sat on the throne said, &quot;Behold, I make all things new.&quot; And He said to me, &quot;Write, for these words are true and faithful.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 And He said to me, &quot;It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 &quot;He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 &quot;But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me, saying, &quot;Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 having the glory of God. Her light [was] like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Also she had a great and high wall with twelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates, and names written on them, which are [the] [names] of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 And he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 The city is laid out as a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 Then he measured its wall: one hundred [and] forty-four cubits, [according] to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 The construction of its wall was [of] jasper; and the city [was] pure gold, like clear glass. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 The foundations of the wall of the city [were] adorned with all kinds of precious stones: the first foundation [was] jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 The twelve gates [were] twelve pearls: each individual gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city [was] pure gold, like transparent glass. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb [is] its light. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">24 And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 Its gates shall not be shut at all by day (there shall be no night there). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">27 But there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles, or causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="22"><b><font color="#993366" size="5">Revelation 22:</font></b></a><font color="#993366" size="5">&nbsp;</font><font size="5">&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 (NKJV) And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, [was] the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits, each [tree] yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree [were] for the healing of the nations. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 They shall see His face, and His name [shall] [be] on their foreheads. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 Then he said to me, &quot;These words [are] faithful and true.&quot; And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show His servants the things which must shortly take place. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 &quot;Behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed [is] he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Now I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 Then he said to me, &quot;See [that] [you] [do] not [do] [that]. For I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 And he said to me, &quot;Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 &quot;He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; he who is righteous, let him be righteous still; he who is holy, let him be holy still.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 &quot;And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward [is] with Me, to give to every one according to his work. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, [the] Beginning and [the] End, the First and the Last.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Blessed [are] those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 But outside [are] dogs and sorcerers and sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and whoever loves and practices a lie. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 &quot;I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 And the Spirit and the bride say, &quot;Come!&quot; And let him who hears say, &quot;Come!&quot; And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and [from] the things which are written in this book. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 He who testifies to these things says, &quot;Surely I am coming quickly.&quot; Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.</font></p>
