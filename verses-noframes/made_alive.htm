<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but <strong>alive</strong> to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.13 And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being <strong>alive</strong> from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. <br>
