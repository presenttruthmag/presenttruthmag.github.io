<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 Once you were <strong>alienated</strong> from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>Eph. 4:17-19</strong></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. 18 They are darkened in their understanding and <strong>separated</strong> from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. 19 Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.</font><br>
