<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 5:25-29</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live. 26 &quot;For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">27 &quot;and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man. 28 &quot;Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice 29 &quot;and come forth--those who have done good, to the <strong>resurrection</strong> of life, and those who have done evil, to the <strong>resurrection</strong> of condemnation.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 11:24-25</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">24 Martha said to Him, &quot;I know that he will rise again in the <strong>resurrection</strong> at the last day.&quot; 25 Jesus said to her, &quot;I am the <strong>resurrection</strong> and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Cor. 15:12-28</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Now if Christ is preached that He has been <strong>raised</strong> from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no <strong>resurrection</strong> of the dead? 13 But if there is no <strong>resurrection</strong> of the dead, then Christ is not risen. 14 And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up--if in fact the dead do not rise. 16 For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen. 17 And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins! 18 Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable. 20 But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 21 For since by man came death, by Man also came the <strong>resurrection</strong> of the dead. 22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christ's at His coming. 24 Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power. 25 For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet. 26 The last enemy that will be destroyed is death. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">27 For &quot;He has put all things under His feet.&quot; But when He says &quot;all things are put under Him,&quot; it is evident that He who put all things under Him is excepted. 28 Now when all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Th. 4:13-18</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have <strong>fallen asleep</strong>, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. 14 For if we believe that <strong>Jesus died and rose again</strong>, even so God will bring with Him<strong> those who sleep in Jesus</strong>. 15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. 16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. <strong>And the dead in Christ will rise first</strong>. 17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be <strong>caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air</strong>. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.<br>
