<p> <font face="Arial"><strong><i>2 Cor 5:19-21</i> </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">19 that is, that God was<strong> in Christ </strong>reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation. 20 Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God. 21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God <strong>in Him</strong>.<br>
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong><i>Eph 2:1-9</i> </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">1 And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins, 2 in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, 3 among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others. 4 But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5 even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together <strong>with Christ</strong> (by grace you have been saved), 6 and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places<strong> in Christ Jesus</strong>, 7 that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us <strong>in Christ Jesus. </strong>8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Romans 8:1 </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are<strong> in Christ Jesus</strong>, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong>1 Corinthians 15:22</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> For as in Adam all die, even so<strong> in Christ </strong>shall all be made alive.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Galatians 3:26 </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For ye are all the children of God by faith <strong>in Christ Jesus</strong>. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong>2 Timothy 1:9-10 </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us <strong>in</strong> <strong>Christ Jesus</strong> before the world began, 10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</font></p>
