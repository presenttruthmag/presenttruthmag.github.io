<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Genesis 3:17-19 </i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,<strong> till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. <i><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Genesis 5:5  </i></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And all the days that <strong>Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.</strong><strong><i><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Romans 3:10-20  </i></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As it is written, <strong>There is none righteous, no, not one:</strong>  11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.  12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.  13 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:  14 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:  15 Their feet are swift to shed blood:  16 Destruction and misery are in their ways:  17 And the way of peace have they not known:  18 There is no fear of God before their eyes.  19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and <strong>all the world may become guilty before God. </strong>20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.<strong><i><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Romans 5:12-14  12 </i></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wherefore, as by <strong>one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</strong>  13 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.  14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of <strong>Adam's transgression</strong>, who is the figure of him that was to come. <strong><i><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  1 Corinthians 15:21-22  </i></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.  22 For as <strong>in Adam all die</strong>, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. </font><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Col 1:21a</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And you, who once were <strong>alienated</strong> <strong>and enemies in your mind by wicked works, </strong><br>
</font> </p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Eph 4:17-19</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk,<strong> in the futility of their mind,18 having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart;19 who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lewdness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</strong><br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Jer 17:9</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;<strong>The heart is deceitful above all things, And desperately wicked;</strong> Who can know it?<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But <strong>your iniquities have separated you from your God; And your sins have hidden His face from you,</strong> So that He will not hear.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Psalms 51:5</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Behold, <strong>I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me.</strong><br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Psalms 53:2-3</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 God looks down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any who understand, who seek God. 3 <strong>Every one of them has turned aside; They have together become corrupt; There is none who does good, No, not one. </strong><br>
