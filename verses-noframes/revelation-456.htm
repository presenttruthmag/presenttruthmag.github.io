<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4:1 (NKJV) After these things I looked, and behold, a door [standing] open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard [was] like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, &quot;Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and [One] sat on the throne. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and [there] [was] a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 Around the throne [were] twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 And from the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices. Seven lamps of fire [were] burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 Before the throne [there] [was] a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, [were] four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 The first living creature [was] like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature [was] like a flying eagle. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 [The] four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying: &quot;Holy, holy, holy,&nbsp; Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 &quot;You are worthy, O Lord, </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">To receive glory and honor and power; </font></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For You created all things, </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And by Your will they exist and were created.&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5:1 And I saw in the right [hand] of Him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, &quot;Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loose its seals?&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 So I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look at it. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 But one of the elders said to me, &quot;Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals.&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Then He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Now when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 And they sang a new song, saying: </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You are worthy to take the scroll, </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And to open its seals; </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For You were slain, </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And have redeemed us to God by Your blood </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 And have made us kings and priests to our God; </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we shall reign on the earth.&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 saying with a loud voice: &quot;Worthy is the Lamb who was slain </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To receive power and riches and wisdom, </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And strength and honor and glory and blessing!&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Blessing and honor and glory and power </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Be] to Him who sits on the throne, </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And to the Lamb, forever and ever!&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Then the four living creatures said, &quot;Amen!&quot; And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped Him who lives forever and ever.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6:1 Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder, &quot;Come and see.&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 And I looked, and behold, a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, &quot;Come and see.&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 Another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that [people] should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 When He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, &quot;Come and see.&quot; So I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, &quot;A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, &quot;Come and see.&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, &quot;How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Then a white robe was given to each of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both [the] [number] [of] their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they [were], was completed. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place. </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 and said to the mountains and rocks, &quot;Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! </font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 &quot;For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?&quot; </font> </p>
