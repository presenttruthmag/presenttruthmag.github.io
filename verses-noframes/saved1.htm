<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Titus 3:5-8</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He <strong>saved</strong> us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, 6 whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Tim 1:9-10</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 who has <strong>saved</strong> us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began, 10 but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Tim 2:4-6</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 who desires all men to be <strong>saved</strong> and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 5 For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, 6 who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time,<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Eph 2:8-10</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 For by grace you have been <strong>saved</strong> through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast.10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. <br>
