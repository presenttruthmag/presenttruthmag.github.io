<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#993366" size="5">Daniel 8:</font></b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 (NKJV) In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared [to] me--to me, Daniel--after the one that appeared to me the first time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 I saw in the vision, and it so happened while I was looking, that I [was] in Shushan, the citadel, which [is] in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision that I was by the River Ulai.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and there, standing beside the river, was a ram which had two horns, and the two horns [were] high; but one [was] higher than the other, and the higher [one] came up last.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward, so that no animal could withstand him; nor [was] [there] [any] that could deliver from his hand, but he did according to his will and became great.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 And as I was considering, suddenly a male goat came from the west, across the surface of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat [had] a notable horn between his eyes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 Then he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing beside the river, and ran at him with furious power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 And I saw him confronting the ram; he was moved with rage against him, attacked the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to withstand him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled him; and there was no one that could deliver the ram from his hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Therefore the male goat grew very great; but when he became strong, the large horn was broken, and in place of it four notable ones came up toward the four winds of heaven.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 And out of one of them came a little horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Glorious [Land].</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 And it grew up to the host of heaven; and it cast down [some] of the host and [some] of the stars to the ground, and trampled them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 He even exalted [himself] as high as the Prince of the host; and by him the daily [sacrifices] were taken away, and the place of His sanctuary was cast down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Because of transgression, an army was given over [to] [the] [horn] to oppose the daily [sacrifices]; and he cast truth down to the ground. He did [all] [this] and prospered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 Then I heard a holy one speaking; and [another] holy one said to that certain [one] who was speaking, &quot;How long [will] the vision [be], [concerning] the daily [sacrifices] and the transgression of desolation, the giving of both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled under foot?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 And he said to me, &quot;For two thousand three hundred days; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 Then it happened, when I, Daniel, had seen the vision and was seeking the meaning, that suddenly there stood before me one having the appearance of a man.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 And I heard a man's voice between [the] [banks] [of] the Ulai, who called, and said, &quot;Gabriel, make this [man] understand the vision.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 So he came near where I stood, and when he came I was afraid and fell on my face; but he said to me, &quot;Understand, son of man, that the vision [refers] to the time of the end.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me, and stood me upright. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 And he said, &quot;Look, I am making known to you what shall happen in the latter time of the indignation; for at the appointed time the end [shall] [be].</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 &quot;The ram which you saw, having the two horns--[they] [are] the kings of Media and Persia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 &quot;And the male goat [is] the kingdom of Greece. The large horn that [is] between its eyes [is] the first king.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 &quot;As for the broken [horn] and the four that stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall arise out of that nation, but not with its power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 &quot;And in the latter time of their kingdom, When the transgressors have reached their fullness, A king shall arise, Having fierce features, Who understands sinister schemes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">24 His power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; He shall destroy fearfully, And shall prosper and thrive; He shall destroy the mighty, and [also] the holy people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 &quot;Through his cunning He shall cause deceit to prosper under his rule; And he shall exalt [himself] in his heart. He shall destroy many in [their] prosperity. He shall even rise against the Prince of princes; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But he shall be broken without [human] means.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 &quot;And the vision of the evenings and mornings Which was told is true; Therefore seal up the vision, For [it] [refers] to many days [in] [the] [future].&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">27 And I, Daniel, fainted and was sick for days; afterward I arose and went about the king's business. I was astonished by the vision, but no one understood it.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
