<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Isaiah 14:3-17</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 It shall come to pass in the day the Lord gives you rest from your sorrow, and from your fear and the hard bondage in which you were made to serve, 4 that you will take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say: &quot;How the oppressor has ceased, The golden city ceased! 5 The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, The scepter of the rulers; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 He who struck the people in wrath with a continual stroke, He who ruled the nations in anger, Is persecuted and no one hinders. 7 The whole earth is at rest and quiet; They break forth into singing. 8 Indeed the cypress trees rejoice over you, And the cedars of Lebanon, Saying, `Since you were cut down, No woodsman has come up against us.' </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 &quot;Hell from beneath is excited about you, To meet you at your coming; It stirs up the dead for you, All the chief ones of the earth; It has raised up from their thrones All the kings of the nations. 10 They all shall speak and say to you: `Have you also become as weak as we? Have you become like us? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, [And] the sound of your stringed instruments; The maggot is spread under you, And worms cover you.' 12 &quot;How you are fallen from heaven, <strong>O Lucifer</strong>, son of the morning! How you are cut down to the ground, You who weakened the nations! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 For you have said in your heart: `I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation On the farthest sides of the north; 14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.' 15 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, To the lowest depths of the Pit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 &quot;Those who see you will gaze at you, And consider you, saying: `Is this the man who made the earth tremble, Who shook kingdoms, 17 Who made the world as a wilderness And destroyed its cities, Who did not open the house of his prisoners?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>
Ezekiel 28:12-19</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. 13 <strong>Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God</strong>; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 <strong>Thou art the anointed cherub</strong> that covereth; and I have set thee so: <strong>thou wast upon the holy mountain of God</strong>; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 15 <strong>Thou wast perfect in thy ways</strong> from the day that thou wast created, <strong>till iniquity was found in thee</strong>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore <strong>I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God</strong>: and I will destroy thee, <strong>O covering cherub</strong>, from the midst of the stones of fire. 17 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. 19 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more. <br>
