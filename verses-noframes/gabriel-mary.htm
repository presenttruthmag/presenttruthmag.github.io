<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Luke 1:26-35</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 Now in the sixth month the angel <strong>Gabriel</strong> was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, 27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was <strong>Mary</strong>. 28 And having come in, the angel said to her, &quot;Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">29 But when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and considered what manner of greeting this was. 30 Then the angel said to her, &quot;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 &quot;And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name Jesus. 32 &quot;He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">33 &quot;And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.&quot; 34 Then <strong>Mary</strong> said to the angel, &quot;How can this be, since I do not know a man?&quot; 35 And the angel answered and said to her, &quot;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.<br>
