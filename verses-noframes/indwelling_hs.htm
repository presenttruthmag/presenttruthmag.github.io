<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom 5:5</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been <strong>poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit</strong> who was given to us.<br>
</font> </p>
<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom 15:13</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the <strong>power of the Holy Spirit.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the <strong>Holy Spirit who is in you</strong>, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? 20 For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Eph 1:12-14</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 that we who first trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory. 13 In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were<strong> sealed with the Holy Spirit </strong>of promise, 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.<br>
  </font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Titus 3:4-7</i></font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared, 5 not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and <strong>renewing of the Holy Spirit</strong>, 6 <strong>whom He poured out on us abundantly</strong> through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<br>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 John 2:27</i></font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the <strong>anointing</strong> which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same <strong>anointing</strong> teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him.<br>
</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Eph 3:16-21</i><br>
  <br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might<strong> through His Spirit in the inner man, </strong>17 that Christ may <strong>dwell in your hearts</strong> through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height&nbsp;&#8212; 19 to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. 20 Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, 21 to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen. <br>
