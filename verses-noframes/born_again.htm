<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Peter 1:22-23</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: 23 having been<strong> born again,</strong> not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever, </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <em>John 3:3-21</em></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, <strong>Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</strong> 4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man <strong>be born</strong> when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? 5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, <strong>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit</strong>, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is <strong>born of the Spirit</strong> is spirit. 7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, <strong>Ye must be born again</strong>. 8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is <strong>born of the Spirit.</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? 10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? 11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. 12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? 13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: 15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that <strong>whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. 21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.<br>
