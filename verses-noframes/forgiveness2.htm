<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Ps 25:6-11</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 Remember, O LORD, Your tender mercies and Your lovingkindnesses, For they are from of old. 7 Do not remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; According to Your mercy remember me, For Your goodness' sake, O LORD. 8 Good and upright is the LORD; Therefore He teaches sinners in the way. 9 The humble He guides in justice, And the humble He teaches His way. 10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth, To such as keep His covenant and His testimonies. 11 For Your name's sake, O LORD, <strong>Pardon</strong> my iniquity, for it is great.<br>

<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Ps 79:9</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Help us, O God of our salvation, For the glory of Your name; And deliver us, and provide <strong>atonement</strong> for our sins, For Your name's sake!<br>

<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Ps 86:3-7</i> </font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 Be merciful to me, O Lord, For I cry to You all day long. 4 Rejoice the soul of Your servant, For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul. 5 For You, Lord, are good, and ready to <strong>forgive</strong>, And abundant in mercy to all those who call upon You. 6 Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; And attend to the voice of my supplications. 7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon You, For You will answer me.<br>

<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt 6:12-15</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 And <strong>forgive</strong> us our debts, As we <strong>forgive</strong> our debtors. 13 And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. 14 "For if you <strong>forgive</strong> men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also <strong>forgive</strong> you. 15 "But if you do not <strong>forgive</strong> men their trespasses, neither will your Father <strong>forgive</strong> your trespasses. <br>
