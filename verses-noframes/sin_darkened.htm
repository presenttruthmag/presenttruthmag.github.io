<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Matthew 4:16 </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 The people which sat in <strong>darkness</strong> saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Matthew 6:22 </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.<br>
23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be <strong>full of darkness</strong>. If therefore the light that is in thee be <strong>darkness</strong>, how great is that <strong>darkness</strong>!</font></p>
<p><br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Luke 1:79 </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">79 To give light to<strong> them that sit in darkness</strong> and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</font><br>
</p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Luke 11:34-36</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">34 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is <strong>full of darkness</strong>. 35 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not <strong>darkness</strong>. 36 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part <strong>dark</strong>, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.</font><br>
</p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>John 3:19 </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved <strong>darkness</strong> rather than light, because their deeds were evil. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <strong>John 8:12</strong> Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in <strong>darkness</strong>, but shall have the light of life.</font></p>
<p><br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>John 12:35, 46 </strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">35 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest <strong>darkness</strong> come upon you: for he that walketh in <strong>darkness</strong> knoweth not whither he goeth. 36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. . . 46   I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in <strong>darkness</strong>.</font> </p>
<p><br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Acts 26:18 </strong>To open their eyes, and to turn them from <strong>darkness</strong> to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</font><br>
</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 1:1-5, 9-14</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.5 And the light shines in the<strong> darkness</strong>, and the <strong>darkness</strong> did not comprehend it......</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. 11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.<br>
