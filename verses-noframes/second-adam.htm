<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Cor. 15:22, 45</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 For as in <strong>Adam</strong> all die, even so in <strong>Christ</strong> all shall be made alive. . . . 45 And so it is written, &quot;The <strong>first man Adam</strong> became a living being.&quot; The <strong>last Adam</strong> became a life-giving spirit.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
Romans 5:12-21 <U>KJV</U> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Wherefore, as <strong>by one man sin entered into the world</strong>, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 13 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 14 Nevertheless death reigned from <strong>Adam</strong> to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of <strong>Adam's transgression,</strong> who is the figure of <strong>him that was to come</strong>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through <strong>the offence of one </strong>many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by <strong>one man, Jesus Christ,</strong> hath abounded unto many. 16 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. 17 For if <strong>by one man's offence death reigned</strong> by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of <strong>righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.</strong>) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 Therefore as <strong>by the offence of one</strong> judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so <strong>by the righteousness of one</strong> the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. 19 For as <strong>by one man's disobedience</strong> many were made sinners, so <strong>by the obedience of one</strong> shall many be made righteous. 20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: 21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
Romans 5:12-21 <U>NIV</U></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 12 Therefore, just as <strong>sin entered the world through one man</strong>, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned-- 13 for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law.
14 Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of <strong>Adam</strong> to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did <strong>Adam,</strong> who was a pattern of <strong>the One to come</strong>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of <strong>the one man,</strong> <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>, overflow to the many! 16 Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the <strong>one man's sin</strong>: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 For if, <strong>by the trespass of the one man,</strong> <strong>death reigned </strong>through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of <strong>righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ</strong>. 18 Consequently, just <strong>as the result of one trespass</strong> was condemnation for all men, so also <strong>the result of one act of righteousness</strong> was justification that brings life for all men. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 For just as <strong>through the disobedience of the one man</strong> the many were made sinners, so also <strong>through the obedience of the one man</strong> the many will be made righteous. 20 The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, 21 so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
