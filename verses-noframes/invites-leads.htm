<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Acts 20:21</font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <br> 
And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,  21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, <strong>repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong><br>
  Matt. 9:13</strong></i><br>
  <br>
  13 &quot;But go and learn what this means: `I desire mercy and not sacrifice.' For I did <strong>not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.&quot;</strong></font></p>

  28 &quot;<strong>Come to Me</strong>, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</font></p>

      <em>Revelation 22:17 </em></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 And the Spirit and the bride say, <strong>Come</strong>. And let him that heareth say, <strong>Come.</strong> And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <em>John 7:37-39</em></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, <strong>let him come unto me</strong>, and drink. 38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. 39 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <em>John 6:35-40, 65 </em></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: <strong>he that cometh to me shall never hunger</strong>; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. 36 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. 37 All that the Father giveth me shall <strong>come to me</strong>; and <strong>him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out</strong>. 38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. 39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. 40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day......65 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that<strong> no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <em>Matthew 11:27-30</em></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. 28 <strong>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. </strong>29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</font></p>
