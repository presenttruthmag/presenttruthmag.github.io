<p><b><font color="#993366" size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">repentance</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Acts 20:20-21 </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house, 21 &quot;testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks,<strong> repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Chris</strong>t. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Acts 5:30-31</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. 31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for<strong> to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
Luke 15:7-10</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 &quot;I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no <strong>repentance</strong>. 8 &quot; Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? 9 &quot;And when she has found it, she calls[her friends and neighbors together, saying, `Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost!' 10 &quot;Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who <strong>repents</strong>.&quot;<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor. 7:9-10</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to <strong>repentance</strong>. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing. 10 For godly sorrow produces <strong>repentance</strong> leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rev. 2:5, 16, 22</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 &quot;Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly and remove your lampstand from its place--unless you <strong>repent</strong>. . . . 16 `<strong>Repent</strong>, or else I will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth. . . . 22 &quot;Indeed I will cast her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they <strong>repent</strong> of their deeds.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rev. 3:3, 19</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 &quot;Remember therefore how you have received and heard; hold fast and <strong>repent</strong>. Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you. . . . . </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 &quot;As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and <strong>repent</strong>.<br>
