      <strong><em>Proverbs 3:1-7 </em></strong><br>
      <br>
My son, forget not my law; but <strong>let thine heart keep my commandments: </strong>2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. 3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon <strong>the table of thine heart</strong>: 4 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. 5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. 6 In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths. 7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</font> </p>
