<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom 7:4-6 </i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another-- to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God. 5 For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit to death. 6 But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter. <br>
