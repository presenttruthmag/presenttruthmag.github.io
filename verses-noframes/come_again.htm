<p class="style1 style2">Come again</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em>John 14:1-3</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, <strong>I will come again</strong>, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><br>
  <em>Matthew 24:3, 27, 30, 31, 35-44 </em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of <strong>thy coming, and of the end of the world?</strong>.... 27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also <strong>the</strong> <strong>coming of the Son of man</strong> be....30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the <strong>Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven </strong>with power and great glory. </p>
<p class="style1">31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.....35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. 36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. 37 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also<strong> the coming of the Son of man</strong> be. 38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, 39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also <strong>the coming of the Son of man</strong> be. </p>
<p class="style1">40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 42 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour <strong>your Lord doth come</strong>. 43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. 44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not<strong> the Son of man cometh</strong>.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><br>
  <em>John 5:23-29</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1"> 23 That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. 24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, <strong>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</strong> 26 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 27 And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. 28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, 29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the <strong>resurrection of life</strong>; and they that have done evil, unto the <strong>resurrection of damnation</strong>.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><br>
  <em>James 5:7-8 </em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">7 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto <strong>the coming of the Lord. </strong>Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. 8 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for<strong> the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.<br>
