<p><b><font color="#993366" size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">fruit of God's Spirit</font></b></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Gal. 5:22-25</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 But the <strong>fruit of the Spirit</strong> is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. 24 And those [who] [are] Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Col. 1:10</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being <strong>fruitful</strong> in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom. 6:19-23</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves of uncleanness, and of lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves of righteousness for holiness. 20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. 21 What <strong>fruit</strong> did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. 22 But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your <strong>fruit</strong> to holiness, and the end, everlasting life. 23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 15:1-14</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 &quot;I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. 2 &quot;Every branch in Me that does not <strong>bear</strong> <strong>fruit</strong> He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may <strong>bear more fruit</strong>. 3 &quot;You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. 4 &quot;Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot <strong>bear fruit </strong>of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 &quot;I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him,<strong> bears much fruit;</strong> for without Me you can do nothing. 6 &quot;If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned. 7 &quot;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 &quot;By this My Father is glorified, that you <strong>bear much fruit</strong>; so you will be My disciples. 9 &quot; As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. 10 &quot;If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love. 11 &quot;These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and [that] your joy may be full. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 &quot;This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. 13 &quot;Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one's life for his friends. 14 &quot;You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.<br>
