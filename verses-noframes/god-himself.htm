<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 1:1-14, 18</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the <strong>Word was God</strong>. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 <strong>All things were made through Him</strong>, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe. 8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. 9 That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. 11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. 12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 14 <strong>And the Word became flesh</strong> and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.....18 No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
John 5:18, 21, 23, 26</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. . . . . 21 For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. . . . . 23 that all may <strong>honor the Son just as they honor the Father</strong>. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him. . . . . 26 For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
John 6:46, 47</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">46 &quot;<strong>Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God</strong>; He has seen the Father. 47 &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has everlasting life. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
John 8:57-59</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">57 Then the Jews said to Him, <strong>&quot;You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?&quot;  58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am</strong>. 59 Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
John 14:1</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 &quot;Let not your heart be troubled; <strong>you believe in God, believe also in Me. </strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
Col. 1:15-19</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 <strong>He is the image of the invisible God</strong>, the firstborn over all creation. 16 <strong>For by Him all things were created</strong> that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. 17 And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist. 18 And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence. 19 For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell, </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
Heb. 1:1-3, 6-12 </i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, 2 has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, <strong>through whom also He made the worlds</strong>; 3 who being the brightness of His glory and <strong>the express image of His person</strong>, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: &quot;<strong>Let all the angels of God worship Him</strong>.&quot; 7 And of the angels He says: &quot;Who makes His angels spirits And His ministers a flame of fire.&quot; 8 But to the Son He says: &quot;<strong>Your throne, O God, is forever and ever</strong>; A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your Kingdom. 9 You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.&quot; 10 And: &quot;<strong>You, LORD, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth</strong>, And the heavens are the work of Your hands. 11 They will perish, but You remain; And they will all grow old like a garment; 12 Like a cloak You will fold them up, And they will be changed. But You are the same, And Your years will not fail.&quot;</font></p>
