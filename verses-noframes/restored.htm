<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Is. 51:3 </i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 For the Lord will comfort Zion, He will comfort all her waste places; He will make her wilderness like Eden, And her desert like the garden of the Lord; Joy and gladness will be found in it, Thanksgiving and the voice of melody.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Is. 55:12-13</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 &quot;For you shall go out with joy, And be led out with peace; The mountains and the hills Shall break forth into singing before you, And all the trees of the field shall clap [their] hands. 13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress tree, And instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree; And it shall be to the Lord for a name, For an everlasting sign [that] shall not be cut off.&quot;<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Is. 65:17-25</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 &quot;For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; And the former shall not be remembered or come to mind. 18 But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; For behold, I create Jerusalem as a rejoicing, And her people a joy. 19 I will rejoice in Jerusalem, And joy in My people; The voice of weeping shall no longer be heard in her, Nor the voice of crying. 20 &quot;No more shall an infant from there [live] [but] [a] [few] days, Nor an old man who has not fulfilled his days; For the child shall die one hundred years old, But the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed. 21 They shall build houses and inhabit them; They shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 22 They shall not build and another inhabit; They shall not plant and another eat; For as the days of a tree, so shall be the days of My people, And My elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. 23 They shall not labor in vain, Nor bring forth children for trouble; For they shall be the descendants of the blessed of the Lord, And their offspring with them. 24 &quot;It shall come to pass That before they call, I will answer; And while they are still speaking, I will hear. 25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, The lion shall eat straw like the ox, And dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain,&quot; Says the Lord.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Is. 66:22</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 &quot;For as the new heavens and the new earth Which I will make shall remain before Me,&quot; says the Lord, &quot;So shall your descendants and your name remain.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Ezek. 36:24-35</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">24 &quot;For I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all countries, and bring you into your own land. 25 &quot;Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. 26 &quot;I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 27 &quot;I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do [them]. 28 &quot;Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; you shall be My people, and I will be your God. 29 &quot;I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. I will call for the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you. 30 &quot;And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields, so that you need never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations. 31 &quot;Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that [were] not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your abominations. 32 &quot;Not for your sake do I do [this],&quot; says the Lord God, &quot;let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel!&quot; 33 `Thus says the Lord God: &quot;On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also enable [you] to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt. 34 &quot;The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by. 35 &quot;So they will say, `This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities [are] [now] fortified [and] inhabited.'<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 I will bring back the captives of My people Israel; They shall build the waste cities and inhabit them; They shall plant vineyards and drink wine from them; They shall also make gardens and eat fruit from them. 15 I will plant them in their land, And no longer shall they be pulled up From the land I have given them,&quot; Says the Lord your God.<br>
