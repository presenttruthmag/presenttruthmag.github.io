<p class="style1 style2">High Priest</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em>Hebrews 4:14-16</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">14 Therefore, since we have a great <strong>high priest </strong>who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. 15 For we do not have a <strong>high priest</strong> who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are-- yet was without sin. 16 Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><br>
  <em>Hebrews 7:27-28</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1"> 25 Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. 26 Such a <strong>high priest</strong> meets our need-- one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><br>
  <em>Hebrews 9:11-12</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">11 When Christ came as<strong> high priest</strong> of the good things that are already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation. 12 He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.</p>
