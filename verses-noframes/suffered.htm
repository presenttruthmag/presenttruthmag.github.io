<p class="style2">Suffered</p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Acts 17:2-3</strong>  And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures, 3 Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have <strong>suffered</strong>, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Hebrews 2:9-10</strong>  But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the <strong>suffering</strong> of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. 10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through <strong>sufferings</strong>.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Hebrews 5:7-10</strong>  Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; 8 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he <strong>suffered</strong>; 9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; 10 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec. </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Hebrews 13:12-13</strong> 12 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, <strong>suffered</strong> without the gate. 13 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>1 Peter 2:21-24</strong>  For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also <strong>suffered</strong> for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: 22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: 23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he <strong>suffered</strong>, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: 24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>1 Peter 3:18</strong>  For Christ also hath once <strong>suffered</strong> for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Isaiah 53:1-12</strong> Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?<br>
2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.<br>
3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. <br>
4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. <br>
5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. <br>
6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. <br>
7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. <br>
8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. <br>
9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. <br>
10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. <br>
11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. <br>
12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. </p>
