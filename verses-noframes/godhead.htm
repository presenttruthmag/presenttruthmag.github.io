  of the Godhead (Deity) Bodily </h1>

<span class="style1">One word in the above title may be unfamiliar to some readers because more than fifteen different Bibles do not use the word 'godhead'. And perhaps no Bible edited in this century uses 'godhead' in all the three places it is used in the <em>(KJV) King James Version </em>edited in 1611. </span>
<p class="style1">In 1881, when the <em>KJV </em>was in common use and the first English revision of its New Testament was published, an article by H. V. Reed appeared in the magazine <em>Restitution </em>. He wrote: "The word godhead is not good English: it means nothing in itself and conveys no idea to the reader: What is a godhead?" It is merely a bad translation. The Greek manuscript word should be rendered 'divinity' or 'deity'. Many Bible scholars and translators have realized that 'godhead' does not convey clear meaning. <em>Weymouth, Moffatt, Smith-Goodspeed, Farrar Fenton, RSV, Good News, NAS, Living Bible, NIV, J. B. Phillips, Bible in Living English, Jerusalem Bible, NWT, Emphatic Diaglott </em>, and <em>The Everyday Bible </em>versions, all recognizing its inadequacy, use some word or phrase other than 'godhead' seen three times in the <em>KJV </em>, where, in <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/cgi-bin/bible?version=KJV&passage=Acts+17:29">Acts 17:29 </a>, <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/cgi-bin/bible?version=KJV&passage=Romans+1:20">Rom. 1:20 </a>, <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/cgi-bin/bible?version=KJV&passage=Colossians+2:9">Col. 2:9 </a>, it represents a different Greek word each time. </p>
<p class="style1">'Godhead' in Colossians 2:9 of the <em>KJV </em>is a translation of the Greek <em>theotees </em>, which is "an abstract noun for <em>theos </em>," the usual Greek word translated 'God'. <em>(Greek-English Lexicon, Bauer, Arndt, Gingrich) </em>"An abstract noun is one indicating a quality, as goodness, beauty." <em>(Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary, International Edition) </em>. From this it is seen that when Paul wrote of Christ Jesus that <em>"In Him dwelleth all the fullness of deity" </em>he said that all the qualities of God dwelt in Christ Jesus our Lord. In view of that, one may be sure that whatever 'godhead' may be thought to mean, it surely does not properly represent the meaning of the Greek words Paul wrote. </p>
<h3 class="style1">God's Fullness Came First to Christ Jesus </h3>
<span class="style1">Colossians was written because of the Apostle's concern that brethren with whom he had never shared spiritual perceptions in personal contact were being taught unsound concepts. In the first chapter, <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/cgi-bin/bible?version=KJV&passage=Colossians+1:5-22">verses 5-22 </a>, Paul refreshed their minds regarding <em>"the word of truth" </em>of the gospel and the living hope which had already been brought unto them. The Apostle realized that <em>"traditions of Men" </em>had been delivered to them by teachers who developed elements of a wisdom suited to the proud, curious, speculating, and carnal temper of the world. These traditions were blended with legal, external observances by Judaizing teachers, and were incompatible with the doctrine of Christ. This situation made Paul's admonition in <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/cgi-bin/bible?version=KJV&passage=Colossians+2:6-9">Col. 2:6-9 </a>especially appropriate and timely. </span>
<p class="style1">This is a wonderful assurance to us as trusting Christians! All the attributes which are part of God's being are 'housed permanently' in our Leader and Forerunner! The completeness of our Lord's powers was constituted when <em>"He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high." </em>The assertion that <em>"all the fullness of deity" </em>dwells in Christ means that the qualities which are in God's being are not divided up, part in one and part in others. If on the other hand, the fullness of deity were to be understood as being divided up, it would imply that there were other mediating spiritual powers or independent spiritual forces at work which should contribute their wisdom and power in order that God's work of salvation be fully accomplished. But this is not so. There is not a partial nor temporary indwelling of God's qualities in Christ, but rather <em>"all the fullness" </em>Christ is not in the same rank with other created beings such as angels. <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/cgi-bin/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hebrews+1:5">(Hebrews 1:5) </a>As the Son, He is greater than all that was created through Him. </p>
