<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 15:4-5, 8</i> </font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 "Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear <strong>fruit</strong> of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. 5 "I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much <strong>fruit</strong>; for without Me you can do nothing. . . . .8 "By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much <strong>fruit</strong>; so you will be My disciples.<br>

  19 I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves of uncleanness, and of lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves of righteousness for holiness. 20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. 21 What <strong>fruit</strong> did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. 22 But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your <strong>fruit</strong> to holiness, and the end, everlasting life. 23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>

1 We then who are strong ought to bear with the scruples of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 2 Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, leading to edification. 3 For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, "The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me." 4 For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be like-minded toward one another, according to Christ Jesus, 6 that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 7 Therefore receive one another, just as Christ also received us, to the glory of God. 8 Now I say that Jesus Christ has become a servant to the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 and that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy, as it is written: "For this reason I will confess to You among the Gentiles, And sing to Your name." 10 And again he says: "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people!" 11 And again: "Praise the LORD, all you Gentiles! Laud Him, all you peoples!" </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 And again, Isaiah says: "There shall be a root of Jesse; And He who shall rise to reign over the Gentiles, In Him the Gentiles shall hope." 13 Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. 14 Now I myself am confident concerning you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.<br>

  22 But the <strong>fruit</strong> of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. 24 And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.<br>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>Col 1:10</strong></i> <br>
  <br>
  10 that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being <strong>fruitful</strong> in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;<br>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>2 Peter 1:5</strong></i><br>
  <br>
  5 But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, <br>
