<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor. 5:18-20</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 All this is from God, who <strong>reconciled</strong> us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: 19 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. 20 We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
Col. 1:19-23</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, 20 and through him to <strong>reconcile</strong> to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross. 21 Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. 22 But now he has <strong>reconciled</strong> you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation-- 23 if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. </font></p>
