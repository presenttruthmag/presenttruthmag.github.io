<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8:1 (NKJV) When He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 Then another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense, that he should offer [it] with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel's hand. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw [it] to the earth. And there were noises, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 The first angel sounded: And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. And a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Then the second angel sounded: And [something] like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 Then the third angel sounded: And a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the water, because it was made bitter. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Then the fourth angel sounded: And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 And I looked, and I heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, &quot;Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="9"><b><font color="#993366" size="5">Revelation</font></b><font color="#993366" size="5"><strong> 9</strong></font></a><strong><font color="#993366" size="5">:</font><font color="#993366">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9:1 Then the fifth angel sounded: And I saw a star fallen from heaven to the earth. To him was given the key to the bottomless pit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. So the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 Then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 They were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 And they were not given [authority] to kill them, but to torment them [for] five months. Their torment [was] like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will desire to die, and death will flee from them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 The shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were crowns of something like gold, and their faces [were] like the faces of men. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 They had hair like women's hair, and their teeth were like lions' [teeth]. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings [was] like the sound of chariots with many horses running into battle. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 They had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. Their power [was] to hurt men five months. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 And they had as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew [is] Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 One woe is past. Behold, still two more woes are coming after these things. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 Then the sixth angel sounded: And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, &quot;Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a third of mankind. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 Now the number of the army of the horsemen [was] two hundred million; I heard the number of them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 And thus I saw the horses in the vision: those who sat on them had breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of the horses [were] like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and brimstone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 By these three [plagues] a third of mankind was killed--by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their mouths. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 For their power is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails [are] like serpents, having heads; and with them they do harm. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 And they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts.</font><br>
