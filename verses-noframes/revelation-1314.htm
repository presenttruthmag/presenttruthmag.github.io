<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 (NKJV) Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like [the] [feet] [of] a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 And [I] [saw] one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled and followed the beast. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 So they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, &quot;Who [is] like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 If anyone has an ear, let him hear. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 He was granted [power] to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number [is] 666. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred [and] forty-four thousand, having His Father's name written on their foreheads. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could learn that song except the hundred [and] forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were redeemed from [among] men, [being] firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 And in their mouth was found no deceit, for they are without fault before the throne of God. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth--to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people-- </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 saying with a loud voice, &quot;Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 And another angel followed, saying, &quot;Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, &quot;If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives [his] mark on his forehead or on his hand, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 &quot;he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 &quot;And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Here is the patience of the saints; here [are] those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, &quot;Write: `Blessed [are] the dead who die in the Lord from now on.' &quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; says the Spirit, &quot;that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow them.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat [One] like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, &quot;Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 Then another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire, and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, &quot;Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw [it] into the great winepress of the wrath of God. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, up to the horses' bridles, for one thousand six hundred furlongs. </font></p>
