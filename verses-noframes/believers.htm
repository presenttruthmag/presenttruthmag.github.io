<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Pet. 2:6, 7</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture, &quot;Behold, I lay in Zion A chief cornerstone, elect, precious, And he who <strong>believes</strong> on Him will by no means be put to shame.&quot; 7 Therefore, to<strong> you who believe</strong>, [He] [is] precious; but to those who are disobedient, &quot;The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone,&quot;<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Cor. 1:21</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who <strong>believe</strong> .<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor. 4:3-6</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, 4 whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not <strong>believe</strong>, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them. 5 For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus' sake. 6 For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to [give] the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<br>
