<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 &quot;At that time Michael shall stand up, The great prince who stands [watch] over the sons of your people; And there shall be <strong>a time of trouble,</strong> Such as never was since there was a nation, Even to that time. And at that time your people shall be delivered, Every one who is found written in the book. 2 And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, Some to everlasting life, Some to shame and everlasting contempt. 3 Those who are wise shall shine Like the brightness of the firmament, And those who turn many to righteousness Like the stars forever and ever.<br>
