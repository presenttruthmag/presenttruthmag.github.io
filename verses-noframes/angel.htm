<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Ezek. 28:11-19</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 12 &quot;Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, and say to him, `Thus says the Lord God: &quot;You [were] the seal of perfection, Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. 13 You were in Eden, the garden of God; Every precious stone [was] your covering: The sardius, topaz, and diamond, Beryl, onyx, and jasper, Sapphire, turquoise, and emerald with gold. The workmanship of your timbrels and pipes Was prepared for you on the day you were created. 14 &quot;You [were] the <strong>anointed cherub </strong>who covers; I established you; You were on the holy mountain of God; You walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 You [were] perfect in your ways from the day you were created, Till iniquity was found in you. 16 &quot;By the abundance of your trading You became filled with violence within, And you sinned; Therefore I cast you as a profane thing Out of the mountain of God; And I destroyed you, <strong>O covering cherub,</strong> From the midst of the fiery stones. 17 &quot;Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; You corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor; I cast you to the ground, I laid you before kings, That they might gaze at you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 &quot;You defiled your sanctuaries By the multitude of your iniquities, By the iniquity of your trading; Therefore I brought fire from your midst; It devoured you, And I turned you to ashes upon the earth In the sight of all who saw you. 19 All who knew you among the peoples are astonished at you; You have become a horror, And [shall] [be] no more forever.&quot; ' &quot;</font></p>
