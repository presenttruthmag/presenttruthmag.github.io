<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 1:9-18</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. 11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. 12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. 15 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, &quot;This was He of whom I said, `He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.' &quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses, [but] grace and truth came through <strong>Jesus Christ. </strong>18 No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten <strong>Son</strong>, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Titus 2:13-14</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great <strong>God and Savior Jesus Christ,</strong> 14 who gave Himself for us . . .<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Tim. 3:16</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: <strong>God was manifested in the flesh,</strong> Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory. <br>
