<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt. 28:19</i></font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 14:8-18</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Philip said to Him, &quot;Lord, show us the <strong>Father</strong>, and it is sufficient for us.&quot; 9 Jesus said to him, &quot;Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known <strong>Me</strong>, Philip? He who has seen <strong>Me</strong> has seen the <strong>Father</strong>; so how can you say, `Show us the <strong>Father'</strong>? 10 &quot;Do you not believe that I am in the <strong>Father</strong>, and the <strong>Father</strong> in <strong>Me</strong>? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the <strong>Father</strong> who dwells in <strong>Me</strong> does the works. 11 &quot;Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe <strong>Me</strong> for the sake of the works themselves. 12 &quot; Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in <strong>Me</strong>, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My <strong>Father</strong>. 13 &quot;And whatever you ask in <strong>My name</strong>, that I will do, that the <strong>Father</strong> may be glorified in the Son. 14 &quot;If you ask anything in My name, I will do it. 15 &quot; If you love <strong>Me</strong>, keep <strong>My</strong> commandments. 16 &quot;And I will pray the <strong>Father</strong>, and He will give you another <strong>Helper</strong>, that <strong>He</strong> may abide with you forever-- 17 &quot;the <strong>Spirit</strong> of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees <strong>Him</strong> nor knows <strong>Him</strong>; but you know Him, for <strong>He</strong> dwells with you and will be in you. 18 &quot;I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 John 2:20-27</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 But you have an <strong>anointing</strong> from the <strong>Holy One</strong>, and you know all things. 21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is a liar but he who denies that <strong>Jesus</strong> is the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the <strong>Father</strong> and the <strong>Son</strong>. 23 Whoever denies the <strong>Son</strong> does not have the <strong>Father</strong> either; he who acknowledges the <strong>Son</strong> has the <strong>Father</strong> also. 24 Therefore let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the <strong>Son</strong> and in the <strong>Father</strong>. 25 And this is the promise that He has promised us--eternal life. 26 These things I have written to you concerning those who try to deceive you. 27 But the <strong>anointing</strong> which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same <strong>anointing</strong> teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him. <br>
