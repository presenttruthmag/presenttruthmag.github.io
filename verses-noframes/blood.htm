<p class="style1"><strong><em>Romans 3:25-26</em> </strong></p>
<p class="style1">25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His <strong>blood</strong>, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 26 To declare, I say, at this time His righteousness: that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
</p>
<p class="style4">(New International Version&#8212; Romans 3:25-26&#8212;25 God presented Him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in His <strong>blood</strong>. He did this to demonstrate His justice, because in His forbearance He had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished--  26 He did it to demonstrate His justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.)</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><br>
  <em>Romans 5:6-10 </em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">6 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. 8 But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, being now justified by His <strong>blood</strong>, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. 10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.</p>
<p class="style4">(NIV&#8212; Romans 5:6-10&#8212; 6 You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. 7 Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die. 8 But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Since we have now been justified by His <strong>blood</strong>, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through Him! 10 For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through His life!)</p>

  Matthew 26:27-28   </em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">27 And He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;  28 For this is my <strong>blood</strong> of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. </p>
<p class="style1 style5">(NIV&#8212; Matthew 26:27-28&#8212; 27 Then He took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, &quot;Drink from it, all of you. 28 This is my <strong>blood</strong> of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.) </p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em><br>
Ephesians 1:6-7 </em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">6 To the praise of the glory of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted in the beloved. 7 In whom we have redemption through His <strong>blood</strong>, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace;</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em><br>
Ephesians 2:12-13 </em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">12 That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the <strong>blood</strong> of Christ.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em><br>
Colossians 1:12-22 </em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">12 Giving thanks unto the Father, which has made us meet (qualified) to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: 13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: 14 In whom we have redemption through his <strong>blood</strong>, even the forgiveness of sins: 15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: 16 For by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him: 17 And He is before all things, and by Him all things consist. 18 And He is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the preeminence. 19 For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fulness dwell; 20 And, having made peace through the <strong>blood</strong> of His cross, by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself; by Him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. 21 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled 22 In the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in His sight:</p>
<p class="style4">(NIV&#8212;Colossians 1:12-22   &#8212;12 giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light.  13 For He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son He loves,  14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.  15 He is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn over all creation.  16 For by Him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by Him and for Him.  17 He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.  18 And He is the head of the body, the church; He is the beginning and the Firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything He might have the supremacy.  19 For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him,  20 and through Him to reconcile to Himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through His <strong>blood</strong>, shed on the cross.  21 Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.  22 But now He has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in His sight, without blemish and free from accusation.)</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em><br>
1 Peter 1:18-23 </em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; 19 But with the precious <strong>blood</strong> of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: 20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, 21 Who by Him do believe in God, that raised Him up from the dead, and gave Him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. 22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: 23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em><br>
1 John 1:1-10 </em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; 2 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) 3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. 5 This then is the message which we have heard of Him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: 7 But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the <strong>blood</strong> of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word  is not in us. </p>
