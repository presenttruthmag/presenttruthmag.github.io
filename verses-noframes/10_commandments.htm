<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1 And God spoke all these words, saying:</strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#990000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000">2 "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. </font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#990000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000">3 "You shall have no other gods before Me. </font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 "You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; 5 you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, 6 but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 "You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. 11 For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it. </font></p>

<p><strong><font size="6" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What Does the New Testament Say About the Ten Commandments?? </font></strong><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong>1 John 3:3-6 (NIV) </strong></em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>3 </em>Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure.  4 Everyone who sins breaks <strong>the law</strong>; in fact, sin is lawlessness.  5 But you know that He appeared so that He might take away our sins. And in Him is no sin.  6 No one who lives in Him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen Him or known Him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><br>
      <strong><font size="4">Matthew 5:19 </font></strong></em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least <strong>commandments</strong>, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but <strong>whosoever shall do and teach them</strong>, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Romans 7:7 - 8:14 (NIV) </em></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 What shall we say, then? <strong>Is the law sin?</strong> Certainly not! Indeed<strong> I would not have known what sin was except through the law.</strong> For I would not have known what coveting really was<strong> if the law had not said, &quot;Do not covet.&quot; </strong>8 But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the <strong>commandment</strong>, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead. 9 Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. 10 I found that the very <strong>commandment</strong> that was intended to bring life actually brought death. 11 For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the <strong>commandment</strong>, deceived me, and through the <strong>commandment</strong> put me to death. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 So then, <strong>the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.</strong> 13 Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that <strong>through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.</strong> 14 We know that <strong>the law is spiritual;</strong> but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 16 And if I do what I do not want to do, <strong>I agree that the law is good. </strong>17 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 18 I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. {18 Or my flesh} For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19 For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do-- this I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22 <strong>For in my inner being I delight in God's law; </strong>23 but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God-- through Jesus Christ our Lord! <strong>So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law,</strong> but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin. </font></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NIV Romans 8:1 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, (Some later manuscripts add: Jesus, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit,) 2 because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. 3 For what <strong>the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, </strong> God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man, 4 <strong>in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us,</strong> <strong>who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. </strong>5 Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. 6 The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace; 7 the sinful mind is hostile to God.<strong> It does not submit to God's law,</strong> nor can it do so. 8 Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. 9 You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. 10 But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. (Or because you have been made right with God (justified).)</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you. 12 Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation-- but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it. 13 For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, 14 because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><font size="4">Romans 13:9-10 (NLT) </font></strong> </em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 For the <strong>commandments</strong> against adultery and murder and stealing and coveting&#8212;and any other <strong>commandment</strong>&#8212;are all summed up in this one commandment: &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; 10 Love does no wrong to anyone, so love satisfies all of God's requirements. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><font size="4">Ephesians 6:1-3 </font></strong></em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.  2 &quot;Honor your father and mother,&quot; which is the first <strong>commandment</strong> with promise: 3 &quot;that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><br>
  </strong></em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><font size="4">1 Corinthians 7:19</font></strong></em> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 For it makes no difference whether or not a man has been circumcised. The important thing is to keep God's <strong>commandments. </strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>
  </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em><font size="4">John 15:10 </font></em></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 If ye keep my <strong>commandments</strong>, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's <strong>commandments</strong>, and abide in his love. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>
  </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em><font size="4">1 John 2:1-4</font></em> </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:  2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.  3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his <strong>commandments</strong>.  4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his <strong>commandments</strong>, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.<strong><br>
  </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>1 John 3:22-24</em></strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his <strong>commandments</strong>, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. 23 And this is his <strong>commandment</strong>, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us <strong>commandment</strong>. 24 And he that keepeth his <strong>commandments</strong> dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><font size="4">1 John 5:2-3</font></strong></em> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his <strong>commandments</strong>.  3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his <strong>commandments</strong>: and his <strong>commandments</strong> are not grievous.<br>
