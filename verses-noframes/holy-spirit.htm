<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt. 28:18, 19</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 Then Jesus came to them and said, &quot;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <strong>Holy Spirit</strong>,<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 3:5-8</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 Jesus answered, &quot;I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the <strong>Spirit</strong>. 6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the <strong>Spirit</strong> gives birth to spirit. 7 You should not be surprised at my saying, `You must be born again.' 8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the <strong>Spirit</strong>.&quot;<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 4:24</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">24 God is <strong>spirit</strong>, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.&quot;<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 14:9-18</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 Jesus answered: &quot;Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, `Show us the Father'? 10 Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. 11 Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves. 12 I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. 14 You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. 15 &quot;If you love me, you will obey what I command. 16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another <strong>Counselor</strong> to be with you forever-- 17 the <strong>Spirit</strong> of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for <strong>he lives with you and will be in you</strong>. 18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.&nbsp;<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>John 14:16-17, 25-26</strong></i><br>
  <br>
  16 &quot;And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another <strong>Helper</strong>, that He may abide with you forever-- 17 &quot;the <strong>Spirit</strong> of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for <strong>He dwells with you and will be in you</strong>. . . . . </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">25 &quot; These things I have spoken to you while being present with you. 26 &quot;But the<strong> Helper, the Holy Spirit</strong>, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>John 15:26-27</strong></i><br>
  <br>
  26 &quot; But when the <strong>Helper</strong> comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the <strong>Spirit</strong> of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify of Me. 27 &quot;And you also will bear witness, because you have been with Me from the beginning.<i><br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>Luke 11:9-13</strong></i><br>
  <br>
  9 &quot; So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 10 &quot;For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 11 &quot;If a son asks for bread from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish? 12 &quot;Or if he asks for an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? 13 &quot;If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the <strong>Holy Spirit </strong>to those who ask Him!&quot;<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong>Romans 8:1-17</strong></em> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but <strong>according to the Spirit</strong>. 2 For the <strong>law of the Spirit of life</strong> in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. 3 For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, 4 that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but <strong>according to the Spirit</strong>. 5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live <strong>according to the Spirit</strong>, the things of <strong>the Spirit</strong>. 6 For to be carnally minded is death, but to be <strong>spiritually minded</strong> is life and peace. 7 Because <strong>the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God</strong>, nor indeed can be. 8 So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God. 9 But you are not in the flesh but <strong>in the Spirit,</strong> if indeed<strong> the Spirit of God dwells in you</strong>. Now if anyone does not have the <strong>Spirit of Christ</strong>, he is not His. 10 And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the <strong>Spirit is life</strong> because of righteousness (justification). 11 But if the <strong>Spirit of Him</strong> who raised Jesus from the dead <strong>dwells in you</strong>, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through <strong>His Spirit who dwells in you</strong>. 12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors -- not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. 13 For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if<strong> by the Spirit </strong>you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. 14 For as many as are<strong> led by the Spirit of God</strong>, these are sons of God. 15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received<strong> the Spirit of adoption </strong>by whom we cry out, &quot;Abba, Father.&quot; 16 The <strong>Spirit Himself </strong>bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, 17 and if children, then heirs -- heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together. </font></p>
