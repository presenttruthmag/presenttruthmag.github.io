<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Ex. 20:8-11</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 &quot; Remember the <strong>Sabbath</strong> day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the <strong>seventh</strong> <strong>day</strong> is the <strong>Sabbath</strong> of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. 11 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that [is] in them, and rested the <strong>seventh</strong> <strong>day</strong>. Therefore the Lord blessed the <strong>Sabbath</strong> day and hallowed it.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <i>Matt. 12:8</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 &quot;For the Son of Man is Lord even of the <strong>Sabbath</strong>.&quot;</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <em>Revelation 1:10</em></font></strong></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 I was in the Spirit on the <strong>Lord's day,</strong> and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <em>Mark 2:27-28</em></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">27 And he said unto them, The <strong>sabbath</strong> was made for man, and not man for the <strong>sabbath</strong>: 28 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the <strong>sabbath</strong>.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <i>Luke 23:54-56</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">54 That day was the Preparation, and the <strong>Sabbath</strong> drew near. 55 And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid. 56 Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And they rested on the <strong>Sabbath</strong> according to the commandment.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <em>Genesis 2:2-3</em></font></strong></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 And on the <strong>seventh day </strong>God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the <strong>seventh day</strong> from all his work which he had made. 3 And God blessed the <strong>seventh day</strong>, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <em>Hebrews 4:4-11</em></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 For he spake in a certain place of the <strong>seventh day </strong>on this wise, And God did rest the <strong>seventh day</strong> from all his works. 5 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. 6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. 8 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. 9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. 10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, <strong>as God did from his</strong>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <em>Luke 4:15-16</em></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. 16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the <strong>sabbath day</strong>, and stood up for to read.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <em>Luke 23:56</em></font></strong></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and <strong>rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <em>Mark 15:42-16:1</em></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">42 And now when the even was come, because it was the <strong>preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath</strong>, 43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. 44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">45 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. 47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid. Mark 16:1 And when the <strong>sabbath</strong> was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <em>Acts 13:42-44</em></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">42 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next <strong>sabbath</strong>. 43 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. 44 And the next <strong>sabbath</strong> <strong>day</strong> came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.</font></p>

<em><a href="../Judgment/82.html" target="_blank"><strong>Acts 20:7-11</strong></a> </em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This meeting took place on what we now call Saturday evenng. Paul talked with the believers until midnight when Eutychus fell down from the window sill. After reviving him, then Paul spoke on  until daybreak. This is not a meeting which started on Sunday morning. Sunday, the first day of the week, is <u>not</u> the Sabbath of the bible. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And on the <strong>first day of the week</strong>, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to depart the next day, and he prolonged his message until <strong>midnight</strong>. 8 And there were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together. 9 And there was a certain young man named Eutychus sitting on the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor, and was picked up dead. 10 But Paul went down and fell upon him and after embracing him, he said, &quot;Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.&quot; 11 And when he had gone back up, and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed. Acts 20:7-11 </font></p>

    <u>On Saturday evening</u> we gathered together for the fellowship meal. Paul spoke to the people and kept on speaking until <u>midnight</u>, since he was going to leave the next day. 8 Many lamps were burning in the upstairs room where we were meeting. 9 A young man named Eutychus was sitting in the window, and as Paul kept on talking, Eutychus got sleepier and sleepier, until he finally went sound asleep and fell from the third story to the ground. When they picked him up, he was dead. 10 But Paul went down and threw himself on him and hugged him. “Don't worry,” he said, “he is still alive!” 11 Then he went back upstairs, broke bread, and ate. After talking with them for a long time, even until sunrise, Paul left. 12 They took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted. Acts 20:7-11 </font></p>
