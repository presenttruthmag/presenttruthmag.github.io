<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: &quot;Today, if you will hear His voice, 8 Do not <strong>harden your hearts</strong> as in the rebellion, In the day of trial in the wilderness, 9 Where your fathers tested Me, tried Me, And saw My works forty years. 10 Therefore I was angry with that generation, And said, `They always go astray in their heart, And they have not known My ways.' 11 So I swore in My wrath, `They shall not enter My rest.' &quot; 12 Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; 13 but exhort one another daily, while it is called &quot;Today,&quot; lest any of you be <strong>hardened</strong> through the deceitfulness of sin. 14 For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end, 15 while it is said: &quot;Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not <strong>harden your hearts </strong>as in the rebellion.&quot;<br>
