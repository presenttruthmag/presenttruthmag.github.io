<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>Rom. 8:15-16</strong></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of <strong>adoption</strong> by whom we cry out, &quot;Abba, Father.&quot; 16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>Gal. 4:4-7</strong></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, 5 to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the <strong>adoption</strong> as sons. 6 And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, &quot;Abba, Father!&quot; 7 Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>Eph. 1:4-6</strong></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, 5 having predestined us to <strong>adoption</strong> as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He has made us accepted in the Beloved.</font></p>
