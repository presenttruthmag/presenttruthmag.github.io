<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 &quot; So I say to you, <strong>ask</strong>, and it will be given to you; <strong>seek</strong>, and you will find; <strong>knock</strong>, and it will be opened to you. 10 &quot;For everyone who <strong>asks</strong> receives, and he who <strong>seeks</strong> finds, and to him who <strong>knocks</strong> it will be opened. 11 &quot;If a son asks for bread from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish? 12 &quot;Or if he asks for an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? 13 &quot;If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who <strong>ask</strong> Him!&quot;</font></p>
