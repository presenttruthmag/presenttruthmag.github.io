<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Cor. 6:2, 3</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 Do you not know that the saints will <strong>judge</strong> the world? And if the world will be <strong>judged</strong> by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Do you not know that we shall <strong>judge</strong> angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life? <br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Pet. 2:1-9</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction. 2 And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. 3 By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their <strong>judgment</strong> has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber. 4 For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved for <strong>judgment</strong>; 5 and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly; 6 and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned [them] to destruction, making them an example to those who afterward would live ungodly; 7 and delivered righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked 8 for that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds-- 9 then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of <strong>judgment</strong>,<br>
