<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor. 9:6-9</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. 7 So let each one <strong>give</strong> as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful <strong>giver</strong>. 8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work. 9 As it is written: &quot;He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.&quot;<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Phil. 4:15-17</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me concerning <strong>giving</strong> and receiving but you only. 16 For even in Thessalonica you <strong>sent aid</strong> once and again for my necessities. 17 Not that I seek the <strong>gift</strong>, but I seek the fruit that abounds to your account.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Cor. 9:7-14</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Who ever goes to war at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk of the flock? 8 Do I say these things as a mere man? Or does not the law say the same also? 9 For it is written in the law of Moses, &quot;You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.&quot; Is it oxen God is concerned about? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 Or does He say it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written, that he who plows should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope. 11 If we have sown spiritual things for you, is it a great thing if we reap your material things? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 If others are partakers of this right over you, are we not even more? Nevertheless we have not used this right, but endure all things lest we hinder the gospel of Christ. 13 Do you not know that those who minister the holy things eat of the things of the temple, and those who serve at the altar partake of the offerings of the altar? 14 Even so the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should live from the gospel.<br>
