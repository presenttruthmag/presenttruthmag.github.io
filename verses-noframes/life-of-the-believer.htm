<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom. 12</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. 2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what [is] that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith. 4 For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function,</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 5 so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another. 6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, let us prophesy in proportion to our faith; 7 or ministry, let us use it in our ministering; he who teaches, in teaching; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. 9 [Let] love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cling to what is good. 10 Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another; 11 not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; 12 rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing steadfastly in prayer; 13 distributing to the needs of the saints, given to hospitality. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 15 Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. 16 Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own opinion. 17 Repay no one evil for evil. Have regard for good things in the sight of all men. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men. 19 Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but [rather] give place to wrath; for it is written, &quot;Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,&quot; says the Lord. 20 Therefore &quot;If your enemy is hungry, feed him; If he is thirsty, give him a drink; For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.&quot; 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Tim. 2:2</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor. 13:11</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Finally, brethren, farewell. Become complete. Be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Titus 2:11-15</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, 12 teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age, 13 looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 14 who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself [His] own special people, zealous for good works. 15 Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor. 7:1</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor. 5: 14-21</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; 15 and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again. 16 Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know [Him] [thus] no longer. 17 Therefore, if anyone [is] in Christ, [he] [is] a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. 18 Now all things [are] of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, 19 that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation. 20 Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore [you] on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God. 21 For He made Him who knew no sin [to] [be] sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.<br>
