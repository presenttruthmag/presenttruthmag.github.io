      <em>John 1:1-14</em></strong></font> <br>
      <br>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the beginning was the <strong>Word</strong>, and the <strong>Word</strong> was with God, and the <strong>Word</strong> was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe. 8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. 9 That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. 11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. 12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 14 And the <strong>Word</strong> became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <em><strong>1 John 1:1-3</strong></em>  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the <strong>Word</strong> of life --  2 the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us --  3 that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.</font></p>

    <em><strong>Revelation 19:11-16 </strong></em> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.  12 His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself.  13 He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called <strong>The Word of God</strong>.  14 And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses.  15 Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.  16 And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. </font></p>
