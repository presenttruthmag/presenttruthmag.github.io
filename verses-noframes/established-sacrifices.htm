<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Now the Lord called to Moses, and spoke to him from the tabernacle of meeting, saying, 2 &quot;Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: `When any one of you brings an <strong>offering</strong> to the Lord, you shall bring your <strong>offering of the livestock</strong>--of the herd and of the flock. 3 `If his offering is a burnt <strong>sacrifice</strong> of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it of his own free will at the door of the tabernacle of meeting before the Lord. 4 `Then he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt <strong>offering</strong>, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him. </font></p>
