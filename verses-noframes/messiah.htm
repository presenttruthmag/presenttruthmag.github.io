<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Is. 53:5-12</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 But <strong>He</strong> [was] wounded for our transgressions, <strong>He</strong> was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon <strong>Him</strong>, And by <strong>His</strong> stripes we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to his own way; And the Lord has laid on <strong>Him</strong> the iniquity of us all. 7 <strong>He</strong> was oppressed and <strong>He</strong> was afflicted, Yet <strong>He</strong> opened not <strong>His</strong> mouth; <strong>He</strong> was led as a lamb to the slaughter, And as a sheep before its shearers is silent, So <strong>He</strong> opened not <strong>His</strong> mouth. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 <strong>He</strong> was taken from prison and from judgment, And who will declare <strong>His</strong> generation? For <strong>He</strong> was cut off from the land of the living; For the transgressions of My people <strong>He</strong> was stricken. 9 And they made <strong>His</strong> grave with the wicked-- But with the rich at <strong>His</strong> death, Because <strong>He</strong> had done no violence, Nor was any deceit in <strong>His</strong> mouth. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise <strong>Him</strong>; He has put <strong>Him</strong> to grief. When You make His soul an offering for sin, <strong>He</strong> shall see <strong>His</strong> seed, <strong>He</strong> shall prolong <strong>His</strong> days, And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in <strong>His</strong> hand. 11 <strong>He</strong> shall see the labor of <strong>His</strong> soul, and be satisfied. By <strong>His</strong> knowledge My righteous Servant shall justify many, For <strong>He</strong> shall bear their iniquities. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Therefore I will divide <strong>Him</strong> a portion with the great, And <strong>He</strong> shall divide the spoil with the strong, Because <strong>He</strong> poured out <strong>His</strong> soul unto death, And <strong>He</strong> was numbered with the transgressors, And <strong>He</strong> bore the sin of many, And made intercession for the transgressors.<br>
