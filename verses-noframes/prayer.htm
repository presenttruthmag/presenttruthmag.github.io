</font><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matthew 6:5-13</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 &quot; And when you <strong>pray</strong>, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to <strong>pray</strong> standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. 6 &quot;But you, when you <strong>pray</strong>, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, <strong>pray</strong> to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. 7 &quot;And when you <strong>pray</strong>, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words. 8 &quot;Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him. 9 &quot;In this manner, therefore, <strong>pray</strong>: Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name. 10 Your kingdom come. Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven. 11 Give us this day our daily bread. 12 And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. 13 And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1  Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven. 2 Continue in <strong>prayer</strong>, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; 3 Withal <strong>praying</strong> also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:</font></p>

Ephesians 6:18-19</strong></font></em></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 With all <strong>prayer and petition pray at all times</strong> in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and <strong>petition</strong> for all the saints, 19 and <strong>pray</strong> on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,</font></p>
