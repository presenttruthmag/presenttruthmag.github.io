<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the <strong>Lord's Supper</strong>....... 23 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread; 24 and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, &quot;Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; <strong>do this in remembrance of Me.</strong>&quot; 25 In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, <strong>in remembrance of Me</strong>.&quot; 26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you <strong>proclaim the Lord's death till He comes</strong>. 27 Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 29 For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 30 For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep. 31 For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged. 32 But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</font></p>

      <em>Luke 22:17-20</em></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: 18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. 19 And he took <strong>bread</strong>, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is <strong>my body</strong> which is given for you: <strong>this do in remembrance of me</strong>. 20 Likewise also the <strong>cup</strong> after supper, saying, This <strong>cup</strong> is the new testament in <strong>my blood, </strong>which is shed for you.</font></p>

      <em>1 Corinthians 10:16-17</em></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   16 The <strong>cup</strong> of blessing which we bless, is it not the <strong>communion</strong> of the blood of Christ? The <strong>bread</strong> which we break, is it not the <strong>communion</strong> of the body of Christ? 17 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.<br>
