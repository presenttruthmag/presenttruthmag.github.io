<p><strong><font face="Arial">2 Peter 3:9-14 (American Standard Version) </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial">9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some count slackness; but is longsuffering to you-ward, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up. 11 Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy living and godliness, 12 <strong>looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God,</strong> by reason of which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? 13 But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. 14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things, give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot and blameless in his sight. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">27 And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment, 28 so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who <strong>eagerly wait</strong> for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation. <br>
