<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Gen. 3:8-24</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 And they heard the sound of the Lord God <strong>walking</strong> in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 9 Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, &quot;Where are you?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 So he said, &quot;I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.&quot; 11 And He said, &quot;Who told you that you [were] naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Then the man said, &quot;The woman whom You gave [to] [be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.&quot; 13 And the Lord God said to the woman, &quot;What [is] this you have done?&quot; The woman said, &quot;The serpent deceived me, and I ate.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 So the Lord God said to the serpent: &quot;Because you have done this, You [are] cursed more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly you shall go, And you shall eat dust All the days of your life.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16 To the woman He said: &quot;I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; In pain you shall bring forth children; Your desire [shall] [be] for your husband, And he shall rule over you.&quot; 17 Then to Adam He said, &quot;Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, `You shall not eat of it': &quot;Cursed is the ground for your sake; In toil you shall eat of it All the days of your life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, And you shall eat the herb of the field. 19 In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread Till you return to the ground, For out of it you were taken; For dust you [are], And to dust you shall return.&quot; 20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 Also for Adam and his wife the Lord God made tunics of skin, and clothed them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 Then the Lord God said, &quot;Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever&quot;&#8212; 23 therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken. 24 So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.<br>
