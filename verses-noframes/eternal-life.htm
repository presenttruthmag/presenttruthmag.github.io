<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 3:14-21</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 15 that everyone who believes in him may have <strong>eternal life.</strong> 16 &quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have <strong>eternal life</strong>. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.&quot; </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
John 10:27-30</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">27 My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. 28 I give them <strong>eternal life,</strong> and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. 29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. 30 I and the Father are one.&quot; </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
John 17:2, 3</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 For you granted him authority over all people that he might give <strong>eternal life</strong> to all those you have given him. 3 Now this is <strong>eternal life:</strong> that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
Rom. 6:22, 23</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is <strong>eternal life</strong>. 23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is <strong>eternal life</strong> in Christ Jesus our Lord. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
Titus 3:4-7</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, 5 he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, 6 whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of <strong>eternal life. </strong></font></p>
