<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor 5:14-15</i> </font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if <strong>One died for all,</strong> then all died; 15 and <strong>He died for all</strong>, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for <strong>Him who died for them</strong> and rose again.</font></p>
<p><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1 Cor 15:3-4</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that<strong> Christ died for our sins</strong> according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,</font></p>
<p><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Romans 5:6-10</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 For when we were yet without strength, in due time <strong>Christ died for the ungodly.</strong> 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. 8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, <strong>Christ died for us.</strong> 9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. 10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</font><br>
