<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom. 3:23</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 for all have sinned and <strong>fall short</strong> (<em>Greek</em>&#8212; present continuous tense) of the glory of God,</font></p>

James 3: 2 NIV </font></strong></p>

Romans 7:18-25 NIV </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 I know that <strong>nothing good lives in me</strong>, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19 For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do-- this I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. 21 So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22 For in my inner being I delight in God's law; 23 but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God-- through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.<br>
