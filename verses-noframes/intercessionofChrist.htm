<p class="style2">Intercession of Christ</p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Romans 8:34</strong> Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also <strong>maketh intercession</strong> for us.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Hebrews 7:24-26</strong>  But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. 25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to <strong>make intercession</strong> for them. 26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Isaiah 59:16-19</strong> And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that <strong>there was no intercessor</strong>: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. 17 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. 18 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence. 19 So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him. </p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Isaiah 53:12</strong> he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and <strong>made intercession</strong> for the transgressors.</p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Jeremiah 7:16</strong> Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither <strong>make intercession</strong> to me: </p>
