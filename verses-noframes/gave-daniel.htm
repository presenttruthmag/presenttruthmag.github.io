<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 Now while I was speaking, praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God, 21 yes, while I was speaking in prayer, the man <strong>Gabriel</strong>, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, reached me about the time of the evening offering. 22 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, &quot;O <strong>Daniel</strong>, I have now come forth to give you skill to understand. 23 &quot;At the beginning of your supplications the command went out, and I have come to tell [you], for you [are] greatly beloved; therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision:</font></p>
