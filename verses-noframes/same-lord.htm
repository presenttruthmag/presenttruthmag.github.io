<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 8:53-59</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">53 &quot;Are You greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead. Whom do You make Yourself out to be?&quot; 54 Jesus answered, &quot;If I honor Myself, My honor is nothing. It is My Father who honors Me, of whom you say that He is your God. 55 &quot;Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say, `I do not know Him,' I shall be a liar like you; but I do know Him and keep His word. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">56 &quot;Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.&quot; 57 Then the Jews said to Him, &quot;You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?&quot; 58 Jesus said to them, &quot;Most assuredly, I say to you, <strong>before Abraham was, I AM.</strong>&quot; 59 Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.<br>

<p><strong><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John 12:41</font></i> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">41 These things Isaiah  said (see: Isaiah 6:1-7) when he saw His (Christ's) glory and spoke of Him.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isaiah 6:1-7</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1  In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the <strong>Lord sitting upon a throne</strong>, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. 2 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. 3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the <strong>LORD of hosts</strong>: the whole earth is full of his glory. 4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. 5 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips:<strong> for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts</strong>. 6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.<br>

  13 Then Moses said to God, &quot;Indeed, when I come to the children of Israel and say to them, `The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they say to me, `What is His name?' what shall I say to them?&quot; 14 And God said to Moses, &quot;I AM WHO I AM.&quot; And He said, &quot;Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, `I AM has sent me to you.' &quot;<br>
