<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Cor. 1:17</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the <strong>gospel</strong>--not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
1 Cor. 15:1-4</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the <strong>gospel</strong> I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. 2 By this <strong>gospel</strong> you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. 3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, </font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
Col. 1:23</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">23 if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the <strong>gospel</strong>. This is the <strong>gospel</strong> that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. </font></p>
