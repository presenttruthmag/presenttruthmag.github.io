<p class="style1"><em>2 Peter 3:3-10 </em></p>
<p class="style1">3 knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts, 4 and saying, &quot;Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.&quot; 5 For this they willfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water, 6 by which the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water. 7 But the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word, are <strong>reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</strong> 8 But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 9 The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. 10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which <strong>the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. <br>

<p class="style1"><em>Revelation 1:7 </em></p>
<p class="style1">7 Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all <strong>the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him</strong>. Even so, Amen.</p>
