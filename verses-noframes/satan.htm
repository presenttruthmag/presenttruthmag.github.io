<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Genesis 3:1-6 </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now the <strong>serpent</strong> was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, &quot;Has God indeed said, 'You shall not eat of every tree of the garden'?&quot; 2 And the woman said to the serpent, &quot;We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; 3 &quot;but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.' &quot; 4 Then the <strong>serpent</strong> said to the woman, &quot;You will not surely die. 5 &quot;For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&quot; 6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. ......13 And the LORD God said to the woman, &quot;What is this you have done?&quot; The woman said, &quot;The <strong>serpent</strong> deceived me, and I ate.&quot; 14 So the LORD God said to the <strong>serpent</strong>: &quot;Because you have done this, You are cursed more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly you shall go, And you shall eat dust All the days of your life. 15 And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel.&quot; </font></p>

<strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Job 1:1-12</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">:1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name [was] Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil. 2 And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East. 4 And his sons would go and feast in their houses, each on his appointed day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, &quot;It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.&quot; Thus Job did regularly. 6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and <strong>Satan</strong> also came among them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 And the Lord said to <strong>Satan</strong>, &quot;From where do you come?&quot; So <strong>Satan</strong> answered the Lord and said, &quot;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.&quot; 8 Then the Lord said to <strong>Satan</strong>, &quot;Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 So <strong>Satan</strong> answered the Lord and said, &quot;Does Job fear God for nothing? 10 &quot;Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 &quot;But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!&quot; 12 And the Lord said to <strong>Satan</strong>, &quot;Behold, all that he has [is] in your power; only do not lay a hand on his [person].&quot; So <strong>Satan</strong> went out from the presence of the Lord.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt. 4:1-11</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the <strong>devil</strong>. 2 And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry. 3 Now when the <strong>tempter</strong> came to Him, he said, &quot;If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, `Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.' &quot; 5 Then the <strong>devil</strong> took Him up into the holy city, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, 6 and said to Him, &quot;If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: `He shall give His angels charge over you,' and, `In [their] hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone.' &quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Jesus said to him, &quot;It is written again, `You shall not tempt the Lord your God.' &quot; 8 Again, the <strong>devil</strong> took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 9 And he said to Him, &quot;All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.&quot; 10 Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Away with you, <strong>Satan</strong>! For it is written, `You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.' &quot; 11 Then the <strong>devil</strong> left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt. 13:39</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">39 &quot;The enemy who sowed them is the <strong>devil</strong>, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt.25:41</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">41 &quot;Then He will also say to those on the left hand, `Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the <strong>devil and his angels:</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Luke 4:5-8</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 Then the <strong>devil</strong>, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the <strong>kingdoms</strong> of the world in a moment of time. 6 And the <strong>devil</strong> said to Him, &quot;All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for this has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. 7 &quot;Therefore, if You will worship before me, all will be Yours.&quot; 8 And Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;Get behind Me, <strong>Satan</strong>! For it is written, 'You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve.' &quot; </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 8:44</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">44 &quot;You are of [your] father the <strong>devil</strong>, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own [resources], for he is a liar and the father of it.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><br>
Eph. 4:27</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">27 nor give place to the <strong>devil</strong>.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Eph. 6:11</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the <strong>devil</strong>.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom. 16:20</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 And the God of peace will crush <strong>Satan</strong> under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you. Amen.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Heb. 2:14</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the <strong>devil</strong>,</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>James 4:7</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Therefore submit to God. Resist the <strong>devil</strong> and he will flee from you.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Pet. 5:8</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the <strong>devil</strong> walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 John 3:8-10</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 He who sins is of the <strong>devil</strong>, for the <strong>devil</strong> has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. 9 Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God. 10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor [is] he who does not love his brother.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rev. 20:10</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 The <strong>devil</strong>, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.<br>
