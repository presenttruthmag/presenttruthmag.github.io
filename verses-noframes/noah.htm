<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Gen. 6:8-18</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 But <strong>Noah</strong> found grace in the eyes of the Lord. 9 This is the genealogy of <strong>Noah</strong>. Noah was a just man, perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God. 10 And <strong>Noah</strong> begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 So God looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth. 13 And God said to <strong>Noah</strong>, &quot;The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 14 &quot; Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and outside with pitch. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 &quot;And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark [shall] [be] three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. 16 &quot;You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit from above; and set the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it [with] lower, second, and third [decks]. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 &quot;And behold, I Myself am bringing floodwaters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which [is] the breath of life; everything that [is] on the earth shall die. 18 &quot;But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark--you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.<br>
