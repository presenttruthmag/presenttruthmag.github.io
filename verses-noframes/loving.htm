<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Titus 3:4-7</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 But when the kindness and <strong>love of God</strong> our Savior appeared, 5 he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, 6 whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 John 4: 7-16</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because <strong>God is love</strong>. 9 This is how <strong>God showed his love</strong> among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 10 This is love: not that we loved God, but that <strong>He loved us</strong> and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 11 Dear friends, since <strong>God so loved us</strong>, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. 13 We know that we live in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him and he in God. 16 And so we know and rely on the love God has for us.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>
John 3:16-18</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &quot;For <strong>God so loved the world</strong> that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 &quot;For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. 18 &quot;He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. <br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom. 5:5</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 Now hope does not disappoint, because <strong>the love of God</strong> has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.<i><br>
