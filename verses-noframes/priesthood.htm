<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Pet. 2:5-9</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy <strong>priesthood</strong>, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 6 Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture, &quot;Behold, I lay in Zion A chief cornerstone, elect, precious, And he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame.&quot; 7 Therefore, to you who believe, He is precious; but to those who are disobedient, &quot;The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone,&quot; 8 and &quot;A stone of stumbling And a rock of offense.&quot; They stumble, being disobedient to the word, to which they also were appointed. 9 But you are a chosen generation, a royal <strong>priesthood</strong>, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; 10 who once were not a people but are now the people of God, who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy.</font></p>
