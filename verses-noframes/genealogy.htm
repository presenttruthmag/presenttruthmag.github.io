<p class="style1">Genealogy</p>
<p><em>1 Timothy 1:3-4 </em></p>
<p>3 I urge you, as I did when I was on my way to Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus so that you may instruct certain people not to teach any different doctrine, 4 and not to occupy themselves with myths and endless <strong>genealogies</strong> that promote speculations rather than the divine training that is known by faith. </p>
<p><br>
  <em>Titus 3:9-11 </em></p>
<p>9 But avoid stupid controversies, <strong>genealogies</strong>, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless. 10 After a first and second admonition, have nothing more to do with anyone who causes divisions, 11 since you know that such a person is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.</p>
