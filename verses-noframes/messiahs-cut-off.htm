<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Dan. 9:26-27</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 &quot;And after the sixty-two weeks <strong>Messiah shall be cut off,</strong> but not for Himself; And the people of the prince who is to come Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it shall be with a flood, And till the end of the war desolations are determined. 27 Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; But in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, Even until the consummation, which is determined, Is poured out on the desolate.&quot;<br>
