<p class="style1">Debt (what is owed to an individual or to God, sin, trespass, a legal or moral infraction) </p>
<p class="style6"><span class="style5">Matthew 6:12-15</span> 12 And forgive us our <strong>debts</strong>, as we forgive our <strong>debtors</strong>. 13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from <strong>evil</strong>: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. 14 For if ye <strong>forgive</strong> men their <strong>trespasses</strong>, your heavenly Father will also <strong>forgive</strong> you: 15 But if ye <strong>forgive</strong> not men their <strong>trespasses</strong>, neither will your Father <strong>forgive</strong> your <strong>trespasses</strong>. </p>
<p class="style6"><span class="style2"><strong>Luke 7:40-48</strong> <span class="style3">40</span></span> And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. 41 There was a certain creditor which had two <strong>debtors</strong>: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. 42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly <strong>forgave</strong> them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? 43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he <strong>forgave</strong> most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. 44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. 45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. 46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. 47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her <strong>sins</strong>, which are many, are <strong>forgiven</strong>; for she loved much: but to whom little is <strong>forgiven</strong>, the same loveth little. 48 And he said unto her, Thy <strong>sins</strong> are <strong>forgiven</strong>. </p>
<p class="style6"><span class="style5">Matthew 18:15-20</span> 15 Moreover if thy brother shall <strong>trespass</strong> against thee, go and tell him his <strong>fault</strong> between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. 16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. 17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. 18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall <strong>bind</strong> on earth shall be <strong>bound</strong> in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall <strong>loose</strong> on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. </p>
<p class="style6"><span class="style2"><strong>Matthew 18:21 - 19:1</strong></span> 21 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother <strong>sin</strong> against me, and I <strong>forgive</strong> him? till seven times? 22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. 23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. 24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which <strong>owed</strong> him ten thousand talents. 25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. 26 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. 27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and <strong>forgave</strong> him the <strong>debt</strong>. 28 But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. 29 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. 30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the <strong>debt</strong>. 31 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. 32 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I <strong>forgave</strong> thee all that <strong>debt</strong>, because thou desiredst me: 33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? 34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. 35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts <strong>forgive</strong> not every one his brother their <strong>trespasses</strong>. </p>
<p class="style6"><span class="style5">Romans 4:3-8</span> 3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. 4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of <strong>debt</strong>. 5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 6 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, 7 Saying, Blessed are they whose <strong>iniquities</strong> are <strong>forgiven</strong>, and whose <strong>sins</strong> are covered. 8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute <strong>sin</strong>. </p>
<p class="style6"><span class="style5">Matthew 23:16 </span>16 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a <strong>debtor (transgressor)</strong>! </p>
