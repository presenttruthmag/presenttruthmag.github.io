<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt. 21:43, 44</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">43 &quot;Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it. 44 &quot;And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls,<strong> it will grind him to powder.</strong>&quot;<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Luke 17:29-30</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">29 &quot;but on the day that Lot went out of <strong>Sodom</strong> it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and <strong>destroyed</strong> them all. 30 &quot;Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Jude 5-19</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 But I want to remind you, though you once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward <strong>destroyed</strong> those who did not believe. 6 And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day; 7 as <strong>Sodom and Gomorrah</strong>, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to <strong>sexual immorality</strong> and gone after <strong>strange flesh</strong>, are set forth as an example, suffering the <strong>vengeance of eternal fire</strong>. 8 Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and speak evil of dignitaries. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 Yet Michael the archangel, in contending with the devil, when he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a reviling accusation, but said, &quot;The Lord rebuke you!&quot; 10 But these speak evil of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know naturally, like <strong>brute beasts</strong>, in these things <strong>they</strong> <strong>corrupt themselves</strong>. 11 Woe to them! For they have gone in the way of Cain, have run greedily in the error of Balaam for profit, and perished in the rebellion of Korah. 12 These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast with you without fear, serving only themselves. They are clouds without water, carried about by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots; 13 raging waves of the sea, foaming up their own <strong>shame</strong>; wandering stars for <strong>whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, saying, &quot;Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, 15 &quot;to <strong>execute judgment</strong> on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.&quot; 16 These are grumblers, complainers, walking according to their own <strong>lusts</strong>; and they mouth great swelling words, flattering people to gain advantage. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ: 18 how they told you that there would be mockers in the last time who would walk according to their own <strong>ungodly lusts</strong>. 19 These are <strong>sensual persons</strong>, who cause divisions, not having the Spirit.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Pet. 2:12</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and <strong>destroyed</strong>, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will <strong>utterly perish</strong> in their own <strong>corruption</strong>,<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Th. 2:8</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will <strong>consume</strong> with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><em><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Luke 17:26-32 </font></em></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 &quot;And as it was in the <strong>days of Noah</strong>, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man: 27 &quot;They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and <strong>destroyed them all</strong>. 28 &quot;Likewise as it was also in the <strong>days of Lot:</strong> They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; 29 &quot;but on the day that Lot went out of <strong>Sodom</strong> it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and <strong>destroyed them all. </strong>30 &quot;Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed. 31 &quot;In that day, he who is on the housetop, and his goods are in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field, let him not turn back. 32 &quot;<strong>Remember Lot's wife.</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>
      <em>Romans 1:18-32 </em></strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 For the <strong>wrath of God</strong> is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, 19 because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. 20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, 21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man -- and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things. 24 Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, 25 who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. 27 Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; 29 being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, 30 backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31 undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; 32 who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are <strong>deserving of death</strong>, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them. <strong><br>
