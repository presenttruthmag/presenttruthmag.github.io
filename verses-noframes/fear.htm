<p class="style1 style2">Fear of God </p>
<p class="style1">And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. 5 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: <strong>Fear</strong> him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, <strong>Fear</strong> him.
Luke 12:4-5 </p>
<p class="style1">And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, <strong>Dost not thou fear God</strong>, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? Luke 23:39-40 </p>
<p class="style1"> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: 15 Their feet are swift to shed blood: 16 Destruction and misery are in their ways: 17 And the way of peace have they not known: 18 <strong>There is no fear of God before their eyes</strong>. 19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Romans 3:14-19</p>
<p class="style1"> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in. 20 Well; <strong>because of unbelief they were broken off</strong>, and thou standest by faith. <strong>Be not highminded, but fear</strong>: 21 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. 22 Behold therefore the goodness and <strong>severity of God: on them which fell, severity;</strong> but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. Romans 11:19-22</p>
<p class="style1">Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; 15 And deliver them who through<strong> fear of death</strong> were all their lifetime subject to bondage. Hebrews 2:14-15</p>
<p class="style1"> For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, 19 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more: 20 (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart: 21 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly <strong>fear and quake</strong>:) Hebrews 12:18-21</p>
<p class="style1"> All who proclaim that Jesus is the Son of God have God living in them, and they live in God. 16 We know how much God loves us, and we have put our trust in him. God is love, and all who live in love live in God, and God lives in them. 17 And as we live in God, our love grows more perfect. <strong>So we will not be afraid on the day of judgment, but we can face him with confidence </strong>because we are like Christ here in this world. 18 <strong>Such love has no fear because perfect love expels all fear. If we are afraid, it is for fear of judgment</strong>, and this shows that his love has not been perfected in us. 1 John 4:15-18 NLT </p>
