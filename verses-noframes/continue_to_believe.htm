<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">21 And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled 22 in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight-- 23 <strong>if indeed you continue in the faith,</strong> grounded and steadfast, and <strong>are not moved away from the hope of the gospel </strong>which you heard, which was preached to every creature under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Romans 11:20-22</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">20 Well said. Because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be haughty, but fear. 21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, He may not spare you either. 22 Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness,<strong> if you continue in His goodness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.<br>
