<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Heb 10:14-18</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14 For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being <strong>sanctified</strong>. 15 But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before, 16 "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them," 17 then He adds, "Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more."18 Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin. <br>
