  1 Whoever <strong>believes</strong> that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves Him who begot also loves him who is begotten of Him. 4 For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world--our <strong>faith</strong>. 6 This is He who came by water and blood--Jesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.<br>
