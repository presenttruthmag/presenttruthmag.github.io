  3 For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said: &quot;So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest,' &quot; although the works were <strong>finished</strong> from the foundation of the world. 4 For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: &quot;And God rested on the seventh day from all His works&quot;; 5 and again in this place: &quot;They shall not enter My rest.&quot; 6 Since therefore it remains that some must enter it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience, 7 again He designates a certain day, saying in David, &quot;Today,&quot; after such a long time, as it has been said: &quot;Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts.&quot; 8 For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day. 9 There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. 10 For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.<br>
