  </i>7 &quot;Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you. 8 &quot;And when He has come, He will <strong>convict the world of sin,</strong> and of righteousness, and of judgment: 9 &quot;of sin, because they do not believe in Me; 10 &quot;of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more; 11 &quot;of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.<br>
