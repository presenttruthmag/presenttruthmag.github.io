<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>Rom. 4:3-5</strong></i>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 For what does the Scripture say? &quot;Abraham believed God, and it was <strong>accounted</strong> to him for righteousness.&quot; 4 Now to him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt. 5 But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is <strong>accounted</strong> for righteousness,</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>2 Th. 1:3-12</strong></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all abounds toward each other, 4 so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure, 5 [which] [is] manifest evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be <strong>counted</strong> worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer; 6 since [it] [is] a righteous thing with God to repay with tribulation those who trouble you, 7 and to [give] you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, 8 in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. 9 These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, 10 when He comes, in that Day, to be glorified in His saints and to be admired among all those who believe, because our testimony among you was believed. 11 Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would <strong>count</strong> you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of [His] goodness and the work of faith with power, 12 that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>Luke 21:34-36</strong></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">34 &quot; But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that Day come on you unexpectedly. 35 &quot;For it will come as a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth. 36 &quot;Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be <strong>counted</strong> worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.&quot;<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><strong>Luke 7:6-10</strong></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, &quot;Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am <strong>not worthy</strong> that You should enter under my roof. 7 &quot;Therefore<strong> I did not even think myself worthy</strong> to come to You. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. 8 &quot;For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, `Go,' and he goes; and to another, `Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, `Do this,' and he does [it].&quot; 9 When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, &quot;I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!&quot; 10 And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well who had been sick.</font><br>
