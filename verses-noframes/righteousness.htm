<p class="style1 style2"><strong>Romans 3:21-26 NLT </strong></p>
<p class="style2 style1">But now God has shown us a different way of being right in his sight-- not by obeying the law but by the way promised in the Scriptures long ago. 22 We are made right in God's sight when we trust in Jesus Christ to take away our sins. And we all can be saved in this same way, no matter who we are or what we have done. 23 For all have sinned; all fall short of God's glorious standard. 24 Yet now God in his gracious kindness declares us not guilty. He has done this through Christ Jesus, who has freed us by taking away our sins. 25<u> For God sent Jesus to take the punishment for our sins and to satisfy God's anger against us. We are made right with God when we believe that Jesus shed his blood, sacrificing his life for us. </u>God was being entirely fair and just when he did not punish those who sinned in former times. 26 And he is entirely fair and just in this present time when he declares sinners to be right in his sight because they believe in Jesus.</p>

<p class="style2 style1"><strong>Romans 3:21-24 KJV </strong></p>
<p class="style1 style2">21But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it, 22 the <strong>righteousness of God</strong> through faith in Jesus Christ <strong>for all who believe</strong>. For there is no distinction; 23 since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 they are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, 25  Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;  26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. </p>

<p class="style1 style2"><strong>Romans 4:3-6 NLV </strong></p>
<p class="style1 style2">For the Scriptures tell us, &quot;Abraham believed God, so God declared him to be righteous.&quot; 4 When people work, their wages are not a gift. Workers earn what they receive. 5 But people are declared righteous because of their faith, not because of their work. 6 King David spoke of this, describing the happiness of an undeserving sinner who is declared to be righteous: </p>
<p class="style1 style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1 style2"><strong>Romans 4:3-6 KJV</strong></p>
<p class="style1 style2">3 For what does the scripture say? &quot;Abraham believed God, and it was <strong>reckoned to him as righteousness</strong>.&quot; 4 Now to one who works, his wages are not reckoned as a gift but as his due. 5 And to one who does not work but trusts him who <strong>justifies the ungodly</strong>, his faith is <strong>reckoned as righteousness</strong>. 6 So also David pronounces a blessing upon the man to whom God <strong>reckons righteousness </strong>apart from works: </p>
