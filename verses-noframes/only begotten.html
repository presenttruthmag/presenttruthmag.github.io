<p class="style1">Only Begotten</p>
<p><br>
  <span class="style4">John 1:14 </span></p>
<p class="style2">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the <strong>only begotten of the Father</strong>,) full of grace and truth.</p>
<p class="style2"><br>
  <em><strong>John 1:18 </strong></em></p>
<p class="style2">No man hath seen God at any time; the<strong> only begotten Son</strong>, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</p>
<p class="style2"><br>
  <em><strong>John 3:16-18 </strong></em></p>
<p class="style2">For God so loved the world, that he gave his <strong>only begotten Son</strong>, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the <strong>only begotten Son of God.</strong></p>
<p class="style2"><strong><br>
    <em>1 John 4:9-10 </em></strong></p>
<p class="style2">In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his <strong>only begotten Son</strong> into the world, that we might live through him. 10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</p>
