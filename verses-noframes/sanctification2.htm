<i><strong>2 Cor 7:1</strong></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us <strong>cleanse ourselves</strong> from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, <strong>perfecting holiness</strong> in the fear of God.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Thessalonians 4:1-12 </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more. 2 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. 3 For this is the will of God, even your <strong>sanctification</strong>, that ye should abstain from fornication: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in <strong>sanctification</strong> and honour; 5 Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: 6 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. 8 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. 9 But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 and indeed you do so toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, that you increase more and more; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 that you also aspire to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you, 12 that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and that you may lack nothing.<br>
  </font> </p>
<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Titus 3:8, 14</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to <strong>maintain good works</strong>. These things are good and profitable to men. . . . .14 And let our people also learn to <strong>maintain good works</strong>, to meet urgent needs, that they may not be unfruitful.<br>
