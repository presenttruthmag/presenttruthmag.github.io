<p class="style2"><strong>Luke 12:47-48</strong><br>
And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with <strong>many stripes</strong>.  But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with <strong>few stripes</strong>. For unto whomsoever much is  given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more. </p>
