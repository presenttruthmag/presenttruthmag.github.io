<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Neh. 9:17, 31</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them . . .</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">31 But in your great <strong>mercy</strong> you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Ps. 103:8-18</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love. 9 He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever; 10 he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. 11 For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; 12 as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him; 14 for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust. 15 As for man, his days are like grass, he flourishes like a flower of the field; 16 the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more. 17 But from everlasting to everlasting the LORD's love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children's children-- 18 with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Heb. 8:12</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 &quot;For I will be <strong>merciful</strong> to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&quot; </font></p>
