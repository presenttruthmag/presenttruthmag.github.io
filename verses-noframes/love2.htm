<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 Beloved, let us <strong>love</strong> one another, for <strong>love</strong> is of God; and everyone who <strong>loves</strong> is born of God and knows God.8 He who does not <strong>love</strong> does not know God, for God is <strong>love</strong>.9 In this the <strong>love</strong> of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.10 In this is <strong>love</strong>, not that we <strong>loved</strong> God, but that He <strong>loved</strong> us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.11 Beloved, if God so <strong>loved</strong> us, we also ought to <strong>love</strong> one another.12 No one has seen God at any time. If we <strong>love</strong> one another, God abides in us, and His <strong>love</strong> has been perfected in us.13 By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. <br>
