<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Rom. 5:15-17</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 But the free <strong>gift</strong> is not like the offense. For if by the one man's offense many died, much more the grace of God and the <strong>gift</strong> by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many. 16 And the <strong>gift</strong> is not like that which came through the one who sinned. For the judgment which came from one offense resulted in condemnation, but the free <strong>gift</strong> which came from many offenses resulted in justification. 17 For if by the one man's offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the <strong>gift of righteousness </strong>(justification) will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Eph. 2:1-10</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins, 2 in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, 3 among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others. 4 But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5 even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), 6 and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in ChristJesus, 7 that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the <strong>gift</strong> of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast. 10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.<br>
