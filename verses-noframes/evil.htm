<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Cor. 10:6</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 Now these things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after <strong>evil</strong> things as they also lusted.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>3 John 11</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 Beloved, do not imitate what is <strong>evil</strong>, but what is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does <strong>evil</strong> has not seen God.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Pet. 4:15</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an <strong>evildoer</strong>, or as a busybody in other people's matters.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Pet. 3:8-17</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 Finally, all of you be of one mind, having compassion for one another; love as brothers, be tenderhearted, be courteous; 9 not returning <strong>evil for evil </strong>or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing. 10 For &quot;He who would love life And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from <strong>evil</strong>, And his lips from speaking deceit. 11 Let him turn away from <strong>evil</strong> and do good; Let him seek peace and pursue it. 12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, And His ears are open to their prayers; But the face of the Lord is against those who do <strong>evil</strong>.&quot; 13 And who is he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good? 14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. &quot;And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.&quot; 15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; 16 having a good conscience, that when they defame you as <strong>evildoers</strong>, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed. 17 For it is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing <strong>evil</strong>.<br>
