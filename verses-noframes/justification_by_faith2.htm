<p class="style1 style2">Justification by Faith in Christ Alone </p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Romans 3:20-31</strong> For no one can ever be <strong>made right in God's sight</strong> by doing what His law commands. For the more we know God's law, the clearer it becomes that we aren't obeying it. 21 But now God has shown us a different <strong>way of being right in His sigh</strong>t&#8212;not by obeying the law but by the way promised in the Scriptures long ago. 22 We are <strong>made right in God's sight</strong> when we trust in Jesus Christ to take away our sins. And we all can be saved in this same way, no matter who we are or what we have done. </p>
<p class="style1">23 For all have sinned; all fall short of God's glorious standard. 24 Yet now God in His gracious kindness <strong>declares us not guilty</strong>. He has done this through Christ Jesus, who has freed us by taking away our sins. 25 For God sent Jesus to take the punishment for our sins and to satisfy God's anger against us. We are <strong>made right with God </strong>when we believe that Jesus shed His blood, sacrificing His life for us. God was being entirely fair and just when He did not punish those who sinned in former times. 26 And He is entirely fair and just in this present time when He <strong>declares sinners to be right in His sight </strong>because they believe in Jesus. </p>
<p class="style1">27 Can we boast, then, that we have done anything to be accepted by God? No, because our acquittal is not based on our good deeds. It is based on our faith. 28 So we are <strong>made right with God through faith</strong> and not by obeying the law. 29 After all, God is not the God of the Jews only, is he? Isn't he also the God of the Gentiles? Of course he is. </p>
<p class="style1">30 There is only one God, and there is only one way of <strong>being accepted </strong>by him. He <strong>makes people right with himself only by faith</strong>, whether they are Jews or Gentiles. 31 Well then, if we emphasize faith, does this mean that we can forget about the law? Of course not! In fact, only when we have faith do we truly fulfill the law. </p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Romans 4:1-25</strong>   Abraham was, humanly speaking, the founder of our Jewish nation. What were his experiences concerning this question of being saved by faith?  2 Was it because of his good deeds that God accepted him? If so, he would have had something to boast about. But from God's point of view Abraham had no basis at all for pride.  3 For the Scriptures tell us, &quot;Abraham believed God, so <strong>God declared him to be righteous.</strong>&quot; </p>
<p class="style1">4 When people work, their wages are not a gift. Workers earn what they receive. 5 But <strong>people are declared righteous because of their faith,</strong> not because of their work. 6 King David spoke of this, describing the happiness of an undeserving sinner who is declared to be righteous: 7 &quot;Oh, what joy for those whose disobedience is forgiven, whose sins are put out of sight. </p>
<p class="style1">8 Yes, what joy for those whose sin is no longer counted against them by the Lord.&quot; 9 Now then, is this blessing only for the Jews, or is it for Gentiles, too? Well, what about Abraham? We have been saying <strong>he was declared righteous by God because of his faith. </strong>10 But how did his faith help him? Was he <strong>declared righteous</strong> only after he had been circumcised, or was it before he was circumcised? The answer is that <strong>God accepted him first</strong>, and then he was circumcised later! 11 The circumcision ceremony was a sign that Abraham already had faith and that <strong>God had already accepted him and declared him to be righteous</strong>&#8212;even before he was circumcised. </p>
<p class="style1">So Abraham is the spiritual father of those who have faith but have not been circumcised. They are <strong>made right with God by faith.</strong> 12 And Abraham is also the spiritual father of those who have been circumcised, but only if they have the same kind of faith Abraham had before he was circumcised. 13 It is clear, then, that God's promise to give the whole earth to Abraham and his descendants was not based on obedience to God's law, but on the new relationship with God that comes by faith. </p>
<p class="style1">14 So if you claim that God's promise is for those who obey God's law and think they are &quot;good enough&quot; in God's sight, then you are saying that faith is useless. And in that case, the promise is also meaningless. 15 But the law brings punishment on those who try to obey it. (The only way to avoid breaking the law is to have no law to break!) </p>
<p class="style1">16 So that's why faith is the key! God's promise is given to us as a free gift. And we are certain to receive it, whether or not we follow Jewish customs, if we have faith like Abraham's. For Abraham is the father of all who believe. 17 That is what the Scriptures mean when God told him, &quot;I have made you the father of many nations.&quot; This happened because Abraham believed in the God who brings the dead back to life and who brings into existence what didn't exist before. </p>
<p class="style1">18 When God promised Abraham that he would become the father of many nations, Abraham believed him. God had also said, &quot;Your descendants will be as numerous as the stars,&quot; even though such a promise seemed utterly impossible! 19 And Abraham's faith did not weaken, even though he knew that he was too old to be a father at the age of one hundred and that Sarah, his wife, had never been able to have children. </p>
<p class="style1">20 Abraham never wavered in believing God's promise. In fact, his faith grew stronger, and in this he brought glory to God. 21 He was absolutely convinced that God was able to do anything he promised. 22 And because of Abraham's faith, <strong>God declared him to be righteous.</strong> 23 Now this wonderful truth&#8212;that <strong>God declared him to be righteous</strong>&#8212;wasn't just for Abraham's benefit. 24 It was for us, too, assuring us that <strong>God will also declare us to be righteous if we believe in God</strong>, <strong>who brought Jesus our Lord back from the dead.</strong> 25 He was handed over <strong>to die because of our sins</strong>, and <strong>he was raised from the dead to make us right with God. </strong></p>
