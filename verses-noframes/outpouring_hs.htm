<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 Of this salvation the prophets have inquired and searched carefully, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,11 searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ who was in them was indicating when He testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow. 12 To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but to us they were ministering the things which now have been reported to you through those who have preached the gospel to you <strong>by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven</strong>--things which angels desire to look into. </font></p>
