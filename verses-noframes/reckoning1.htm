<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Romans 4:3-8</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3 For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was <strong>accounted</strong> to him for righteousness." 4 Now to him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt. 5 But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is <strong>accounted</strong> for righteousness, 6 just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works: 7 "Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, And whose sins are covered; 8 Blessed is the man to whom the LORD shall not impute sin." </font></p>
