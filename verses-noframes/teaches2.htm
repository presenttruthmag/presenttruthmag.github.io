<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Johnn 14:26</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 &quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, <strong>He will teach you all things</strong>, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you. <br>

<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Cor 2:9-16</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 But as it is written: &quot;Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.&quot; 10 But God has revealed [them] to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.11 For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but <strong>the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God. </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 These things we also speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches but <strong>which the Holy Spirit teaches,</strong> comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 14 But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know [them,] because they are spiritually discerned. 15 But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one. 16 For &quot;who has known the mind of the LORD that he may instruct Him?&quot; But we have the mind of Christ. <br>
