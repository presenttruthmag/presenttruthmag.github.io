<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 11:47-52</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, &quot;What shall we do? For this Man works many signs. 48 &quot;If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.&quot; 49 And one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, &quot;You know nothing at all, 50 &quot;nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that<strong> one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.</strong>&quot; 51 Now this he did not say on his own authority; but being high priest that year he prophesied that <strong>Jesus would die for the nation</strong>, 52 and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Romans 5:10</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For if when we were enemies we were <strong>reconciled</strong> to God through the <strong>death</strong> of His Son, much more, having been <strong>reconciled</strong>, we shall be <strong>saved</strong> by His life.<br>

</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>2 Cor 5:18-19</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18 Now all things are of God, who has <strong>reconciled</strong> us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the <strong>ministry of reconciliation</strong>, 19 that is, that God was in Christ <strong>reconciling</strong> the world to Himself, <strong>not imputing their trespasses</strong> to them, and has committed to us the word of <strong>reconciliation</strong>.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Heb 2:17</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make <strong>propitiation for the sins</strong> of the people.<br>

</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Titus 2:14</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">who gave Himself for us, that He might <strong>redeem</strong> us from every lawless deed and <strong>purify</strong> for Himself His own special people, zealous for good works.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Eph 1:6-7</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He has <strong>made us accepted</strong> in the Beloved. 7 In Him we have <strong>redemption</strong> through His blood, the <strong>forgiveness</strong> of sins, according to the riches of His <strong>grace</strong><br>
