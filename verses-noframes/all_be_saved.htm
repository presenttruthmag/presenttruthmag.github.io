 <p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>2 Peter 3:9</em></font></strong></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward,<strong> not willing that any should perish,</strong> but that all should come to repentance. 10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. 11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</font></p>

     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>1 Timothy 2:4 </em></font></strong></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4 Who will have <strong>all men to be saved</strong>, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.<br>
 </font></p>
 <p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Matthew 18:14</em></font></strong></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. 12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? 13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray. 14 Even so <strong>it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</strong></font></p>
