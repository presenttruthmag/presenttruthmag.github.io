<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. 11 Put on the <strong>whole armor </strong>of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 14 Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 15 and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 16 above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.<br>
