<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>John 14:26</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">26 &quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, <strong>He will teach you all things</strong>, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.<br>
</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Cor. 2:9-16</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 &nbsp; But as it is written: &quot;Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.&quot; 10 But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. 11 For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but <strong>the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God.</strong> 13 These things we also speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches but <strong>which the Holy Spirit teaches, </strong>comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 14 But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one. 16 For &quot;who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him?&quot; But we have the mind of Christ.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <i>2 Tim. 2:2, 24-25</i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2 And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful <strong>men who will be able to teach others</strong> also. . . . 24 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, <strong>able to teach</strong>, patient, 25 in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth,</font></p>
