<p class="style4"><strong><em>Hebrews 3:14-15 </em></strong><br>
  <br>
14 For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end, 15 while it is said: &quot;Today, if you will hear His voice, <strong>Do not harden your hearts</strong> as in the rebellion.&quot; </p>
<p class="style4"><em><strong><br>
Hebrews 3:7-12 </strong></em></p>
<p class="style4">7 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: &quot;Today, if you will hear His voice, 8 <strong>Do not harden your hearts</strong> as in the rebellion, In the day of trial in the wilderness, 9 Where your fathers tested Me, tried Me, And saw My works forty years. 10 Therefore I was angry with that generation, And said, 'They always go astray in their heart, And they have not known My ways.' 11 So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest.' &quot; 12 Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil <strong>heart of unbelief </strong>in departing from the living God;</p>
