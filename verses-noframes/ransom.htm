<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Tim. 2:6</i></font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <em><strong>Isaiah 35:9-10</strong></em></font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there: 10 And the <strong>ransomed</strong> of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <em><strong>Isaiah 51:9-11 </strong> </em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9 Awake, awake! Clothe yourself with strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in days gone by, as in generations of old. Was it not you who cut Rahab to pieces, who pierced that monster through?  10 Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made a road in the depths of the sea so that the redeemed might cross over?  11 The<strong> ransomed</strong> of the LORD will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <em><strong>Jeremiah 31:10-12</strong></em>  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 &quot;Hear the word of the LORD, O nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands: 'He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.' 11 For the LORD will <strong>ransom</strong> Jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they. 12 They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will rejoice in the bounty of the LORD&#8212;the grain, the new wine and the oil, the young of the flocks and herds. They will be like a well-watered garden, and they will sorrow no more. </font></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong>Isaiah 53:1-12 NLT </strong></em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Who has believed our message? To whom will the LORD reveal his saving power? 2 My servant grew up in the LORD's presence like a tender green shoot, sprouting from a root in dry and sterile ground. There was nothing beautiful or majestic about his appearance, nothing to attract us to him. 3 He was despised and rejected-- a man of sorrows, acquainted with bitterest grief. We turned our backs on him and looked the other way when he went by. <br>
  <br>
He was despised, and we did not care. 4 Yet it was our weaknesses he carried; it was our sorrows that weighed him down. And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God for his own sins! 5 But he was wounded and crushed for our sins. He was beaten that we might have peace. He was whipped, and we were healed! 6 All of us have strayed away like sheep. We have left God's paths to follow our own. <br>
<br>
Yet the LORD laid on him the guilt and sins of us all. 7 He was oppressed and treated harshly, yet he never said a word. He was led as a lamb to the slaughter. And as a sheep is silent before the shearers, he did not open his mouth. 8 From prison and trial they led him away to his death. But who among the people realized that he was dying for their sins</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&#8212;</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">that he was suffering their punishment? 9 He had done no wrong, and he never deceived anyone. But he was buried like a criminal; he was put in a rich man's grave. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 But it was the LORD's good plan to crush him and fill him with grief. Yet when his life is made an offering for sin, he will have a multitude of children, many heirs. He will enjoy a long life, and the LORD's plan will prosper in his hands. 11 When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish, he will be satisfied. And because of what he has experienced, my righteous servant will make it possible for many to be counted righteous, for he will bear all their sins. 12 I will give him the honors of one who is mighty and great, because he exposed himself to death. He was counted among those who were sinners. He bore the sins of many and interceded for sinners. </font></p>
