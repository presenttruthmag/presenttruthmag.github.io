<p class="style1 style2">Sodom and Gomorrah </p>
<p class="style1"><em>Genesis 18:20-21</em></p>
<p class="style1"> 20 And the LORD said, &quot;Because the outcry against <strong>Sodom and Gomorrah</strong> is great, and because their sin is very grave, 21 &quot;I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has come to Me; and if not, I will know.&quot; </p>
<p class="style1"><em><br>
Genesis 19:4-6  </em></p>
<p class="style1">4 Now before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of <strong>Sodom</strong>, both old and young, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house.  5 And they called to Lot and said to him, &quot;Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them carnally.&quot; 6 So Lot went out to them through the doorway, shut the door behind him, </p>
<p class="style1"><em><br>
Genesis 19:24-25 </em></p>
<p class="style1">24 Then the LORD rained brimstone and fire on <strong>Sodom and Gomorrah</strong>, from the LORD out of the heavens. 25 So He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. </p>
<p class="style1"><br>
<em>Isaiah 3:8-9 </em></p>
<p class="style1">Because their tongue and their doings Are against the LORD, To provoke the eyes of His glory. 9 The look on their countenance witnesses against them, And they declare their sin as <strong>Sodom</strong>; They do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have brought evil upon themselves. </p>
<p class="style1"><em><br>
Jeremiah 23:14-15  </em></p>
<p class="style1">They commit adultery and walk in lies; They also strengthen the hands of evildoers, So that no one turns back from his wickedness. All of them are like <strong>Sodom</strong> to Me, And her inhabitants like <strong>Gomorrah</strong>.  15 &quot;Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: 'Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, And make them drink the water of gall;</p>
<p class="style1"><em><br>
Jude 1:7  </em></p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Sodom and Gomorrah</strong>, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. </p>
<p class="style1"><em><br>
Matthew 24:37-39  </em></p>
<p class="style1">37 &quot;But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 38 &quot;For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39 &quot;and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. <br>
