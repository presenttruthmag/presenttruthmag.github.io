<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Is. 53:5-6, 8, 11</i> </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 But He [was] wounded for our transgressions, [He] [was] bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace [was] upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to his own way; And the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. . . . . 8 He was taken from prison and from judgment, And who will declare His generation? For He was cut off from the land of the living; For the transgressions of My people He was stricken. . . . . 11 He shall see the labor of His soul, [and] be satisfied. By His knowledge My righteous Servant shall <strong>justify</strong> many, For He shall bear their iniquities. </font></p>
