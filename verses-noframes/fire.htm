<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of <strong>eternal fire.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Matt. 3:10, 12 </i></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10 &quot;And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees.
