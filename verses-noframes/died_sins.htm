<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Romans 5:5-8</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us. 6 For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ <strong>died</strong> for the ungodly. 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. 8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ <strong>died</strong> for us.<br>
</font> </p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Isaiah 53:8-9</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8 He was taken from prison and from judgment, And who will declare His generation? For He was <strong>cut off</strong> from the land of the living; For the transgressions of My people He was <strong>stricken</strong>. 9 And they made His grave with the wicked--But with the rich at His <strong>death</strong>, Because He had done no violence, Nor was any deceit in His mouth.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 John 3:4</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and <strong>sin is lawlessness.<br>
</strong></font> </p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Romans 3:20</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for <strong>by the law is the knowledge of sin. <br>
