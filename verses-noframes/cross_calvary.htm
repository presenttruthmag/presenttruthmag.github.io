<p> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>1 Cor 1:17-18</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the <strong>cross of Christ </strong>should be made of no effect. 18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Gal 6:14</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But God forbid that I should boast except in the <strong>cross</strong> of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Eph 2:16</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the <strong>cross</strong>, thereby putting to death the enmity.<br>
</font> </p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Col 1:19-23</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">19 For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell, 20 and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His <strong>cross</strong>. 21 And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled 22 in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight&nbsp;&#8212; 23 if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was preached to every creature under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister.<br>

<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Luke 23:33</i></font> </strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And when they had come to the place called <strong>Calvary</strong>, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left. <br>
