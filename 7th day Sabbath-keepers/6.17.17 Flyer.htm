<p align="center" class="style1"><span class="style6">This week Mr. Ham discusses the evidence for the existence of dinosaurs both before <em>and</em> after the flood of Noah. He explains  the meaning of the fossil record from a biblical perspective and shows that the scientific data supports  a recent world-wide flood approximately 4,000 years ago. The Darwinian secular scientific community has predicted for over 100 years that the fossil record will ultimately prove the theory of evolution. But just the opposite is happening. The fossil record is becoming a testimony to the truthfulness of a literal six day creation and overwhelmingly disproving the Darwinian theory of evolution. </span></p>
<p align="center" class="style1 style3 style6"><em>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy..... the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God.....For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</em></p>
<p align="center" class="style6 style3 style1"><em>And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel ...saying with a loud voice, &quot;Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.&quot; </em></p>
