Dr. Parker was a world-renowned author of many evolutionary science textbooks who became convinced that the biblical account of creation as found in the book of Genesis was more in line with the scientific data than the theory of Darwinian evolution. Since his conversion to Christ he has spent his entire professional life defending the gospel of Jesus Christ and the literal Genesis account of the six day creation of the world against the false assumptions of the Darwinian theory of biological and geological evolution.</span></p>
<p align="center" class="style6">Dr. Parker has multiple advanced degrees in biology, genetics, and the physical sciences. Before his conversion to Christ and the truth of biblical creationism he was recognized as a one of the world's leading experts in the field of scientific evolutionary theory. Due to his vast understanding of the arguments of Darwinism he is very able to refute those false evolutionary assumptions with well documented scientific data in support of the biblical cosmology and to defend the biblical plan of salvation through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior, Creator, Lawgiver, and Judge. </p>
<p align="center" class="style1 style5"><em>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy..... the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God.....For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</em></p>
