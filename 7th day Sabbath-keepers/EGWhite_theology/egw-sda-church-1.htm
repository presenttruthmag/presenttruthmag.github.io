    <strong><font size="4" face="Arial">Introduction</font></strong> </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">In late 1898, G. A. Irwin, president of the General 
        
Conference, wrote Mrs. White describing the campmeetings then 
        
being held within the United States.  In noting the &quot;unusual 
        
degree of the spirit and blessing of the Lord, &quot;Irwin told Mrs. 
        
White, who was then in Australia, that the &quot;most spiritually-minded&quot; leaders were sent to conduct the meetings.  Those named 
        
were Mrs. S. M. I. Henry, A. F. Ballenger, William Sadler, and J. 
        
A. Brunson.  The only problem was that all, at that time, had 
        
already begun the path that Mrs. White would later define as </font></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">&quot;mystical,&quot; &quot;spiritualistic,&quot; &quot;pantheistic&quot;, and subversive to the 
          
fundamentals of the church. <BR>
          <BR>
          Within a decade, three of the four names by Irwin would be actively 
          
working against the church.  A score of others involved in the 
          
movement known as the &quot;Receive Ye the Holy Ghost&quot; movement would 
          
likewise leave and work against the church.  Those who were left 
          
were regarded as the most dynamic preachers and leaders within the 
          
church. <BR>
          <BR>
          The question to resolve is why did this happen?  I would 
          
suggest that an important reason relates to their mistaken 
          
concepts of the role of the gift of prophecy within the church and 
          
the disunity that erupted within the church over those concepts of 
          
the role of Ellen White.  The evidence I have examined spans the 
          
decade 1896 to approximately 1906 and illustrates the truth of the 
          
following Ellen White statement found in Volume 5 of the 
          
Testimonies, p. 654: </font></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;As the end draws near and the work of giving the last 
          
warning to the world extends, it becomes more important for those 
          
who accept the present truth to have a clear understanding of the 
          
nature and influence of the Testimonies, which God in His 
          
providence has linked with the work of the third angel's message 
          
from its very rise.&quot;[EGW,<em> 5T</em>, 654] </font></p>
</blockquote><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Please observe that Mrs. White is not raising a question 
        
relating to the importance of believing the Testimonies, but 
        
rather one of understanding their &quot;nature and influence.&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        I would suggest that this counsel is vitally relevant to us 
        
today. <br>
        <strong><font size="4"><br>
        General Observation</font></strong></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">I suggest that the work of 
          
Ellen White within the church was intended to be a corporate or 
          
cooperative experience and that by assigning to her roles that 
          
were designed to be the responsibility of the corporate body, or 
          
by failing to fulfill those roles that were the responsibility of 
          
the corporate body [the church], we might have rendered the gift 
          
of prophecy irrelevant in certain areas that I consider should be 
          
vitally relevant today.  I am really suggesting that we have not 
          
taken the writings of Ellen White seriously enough since we have 
          
been content with quick, ready answers to complex question by 
          
relying on a phrase or two, usually taken without understanding 
          
the contextual situation she was addressing.  By a corporate 
          
approach to understanding the gift of prophecy, I am not 
          
suggesting that we all, in a sense, have the spirit of prophecy, 
          
but rather that the church as a whole is involved in the process 
          
of understanding how God blessed the church with this gift.  There 
          
were many examples when Ellen White was shown things in vision 
          
that she, herself, did not understand and hoped that church 
          
leadership would understand. <br>
          <br>
          In considering the history of our church during the last 25 
          
years of Mrs. White's life, I wish to center upon three major 
          
contributions of the gift of prophecy that I believe have deep 
          
relevance to us today. The list is selective and many additional 
          
contributions could be enumerated. <BR>
          <BR>
          
	    <strong>1.</strong> Mrs. White sought to create an atmosphere where 
          
understanding of the balance between law and the gospel would 
          
prevail.  In other words, she worked to create the conditions for 
          
the receptivity of the message that was designed to prepare the 
          
world for return of Jesus.  Notice that I am not saying that Mrs. 
          
White gave us the message, or the fullest understanding of the 
          
balance between law and gospel, but that she sought to prepare the 
          
church to perceive that message. <BR>
          <BR>
          
	    <strong>2. </strong>She provided counsel that was designed to avoid the 
          
fanaticism and false revivals that were then current within the 
          
church and related those issues to past and future errors that 
          
seek entrance into the church in the last days. <BR>
          <BR>
          
	    <strong>3. </strong>She gave long-term counsel relative to the resolving of 
          
theological disputes, especially when those disputes involved or 
          
seemed to involve her writings. <BR>
          <BR>
          I expect to deal essentially with the initial two points in 
          
this first meeting and with the third at the next meeting. <BR>
          <BR>
          I think we will recognize that we have not fully benefited 
          
from these contributions of Mrs. White that I consider major. <BR>
          <BR>
          
	    <strong>1.</strong> We are not united in our understanding of the balance 
          
between the law and the gospel.  In other words, we are not united 
          
in our understanding of the plan of salvation. <BR>
          <BR>
          
	    <strong>2.</strong> We are not prepared to recognize the subtleties of the 
          
deceptions that would be similar, but more devious than those 
          
faced during the pantheism crisis, 1896 to 1906. <BR>
          <BR>
          
	    <strong>3. </strong>We don't practice the counsel given concerning doctrinal 
          
controversies that involve Mrs. White's writings. <BR>
          <BR>
          If this analysis is correct, or partially correct, we must 
          
ask ourselves &quot;Why?&quot; <BR>
          <BR>
          Also, if it is correct, or partially correct, it means that 
          
we have rendered the gift of prophecy of less than full value to 
          
us in areas that I believe were significant contributions of Mrs. 
          
White. <BR>
          <BR>
          Here's another &quot;I would suggest.&quot; We have varying 
          
understandings of the role for the writings of Ellen White that 
          
fit into two broad categories that a layman like myself might 
          
consider as &quot;exegetical&quot; and &quot;non-exegetical&quot; functions of Ellen 
          
White. <br>
          <br>
          

          
	    <strong>EXEGETICAL:</strong> Strict exposition of Biblical passages that lead 
          
to a final conclusion of the meaning of those passages.  How we 
          
get to a theological conclusion.  I believe this is the corporate 
          
responsibility of the church and was not designed to be the 
          
function of Ellen White. <BR>
          <strong><BR>
          NON-EXEGETICAL:</strong> Any other Ellen White roles fit here.  For my 
          
purpose they are better defined by illustration: &quot;John Harvey 
          
Kellogg teaches 'pantheism,'&quot; &quot;Albion Ballenger mystifies the 
          
gospel,&quot; &quot;William  Prescott has truth mixed with error,&quot; etc.  
          
These non-exegetical functions often represent a conclusion, but 
          
do not outline the theological route to the conclusion.  In other 
          
words they don't resolve the theological problems of Kellogg, 
          
Ballenger or Prescott; the theological resolution of those 
          
problems was left to Kellogg, Ballenger and Prescott&#8212;and to the 
          
church. <BR>
          <BR>
          I believe that both exegetical role and non-exegetical 
          
functions are vital to fully solidify a conclusion.  I suggest 
          
that the exegetical role was not intended for the gift of prophecy 
          
and that throughout out history, the Lord intended a cooperative 
          
relationship between Ellen White and the church and that those who 
          
have attempted to place exegetical responsibilities upon the gift 
          
of prophecy have paid a heavy price personally and cost the church 
          
greatly. <BR>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">As we read the history of our denomination, we cannot help 
          
but to be impressed with the warfare of Satan to subvert the 
          
message that God intends for the world to receive&#8212;that delicate 
          
relationship between the law and the gospel. <BR>
          <BR>
          Notice Mrs. White's statement about the death of her husband:  
          
[James White died Aug. 6, 1881] </font></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;At times I felt that I could not have my husband die....We 
              
had designed to devote the coming winter to writing.  My husband 
              
had said, 'Let us not be turned aside from our purpose.  I think 
              
we have made a mistake, in allowing the apparent wants of the 
              
cause and the earnest entreaties of our brethren to urge us into 
              
active labor in preaching when we should have been writing.  While 
              
our mental powers are unimpaired, we should complete our 
              
contemplated books.  I design to arrange my business affairs, go 
              
to the Pacific Coast and devote the winter months to writing.  It 
              
is a duty to which we owe to ourselves and to the cause of God to 
              
rest from the heat of battle and to give to our people the 
              
precious light of truth which God has opened to our minds.  I feel 
              
assured there is a crisis before us.  We should preserve our 
              
physical and mental powers for future service.  The glorious 
              
subject of Redemption should long ago have been more fully 
              
presented to the people; but I have allowed myself to be called 
              
into the field, to attend camp-meetings, and have become so worn 
              
that I could not engage in writing,'&quot; [Ellen White, &quot;A Sketch of 
              
Experience,&quot; in <em>In Memoriam: A Sketch of the Last Sickness and 
              
Death of Elder James White</em>, pp. 54-5.] </font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">A decade after her husband's death, Mrs. White made this 
                
significant statement relating to law-gospel interrelationship: </font></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We must look more to the presentation of God's love and 
                      
mercy to move the hearts of the people.  We must have a sense of 
                      
both the justice and mercy of God.  Those who can blend together 
                      
the law of God and the mercy of God can reach any heart.  For 
                      
years I have seen that there is a broken link which has kept us 
                      
from reaching hearts; this link is supplied by presenting the love 
                      
and mercy of God.  There has been a sentiment creeping in that we 
                      
should not present the claims of the Sabbath so strong.  Why not?  
                      
Is it not true that the man of sin is raising up the counterfeit 
                      
and undermining the law of God, and should we not raise up the 
                      
standard against him?&quot;[Ellen White at Council of Presidents 
                      
Meeting, March 3, 1891.] [This statement by itself presents an interesting picture of 
                      
the way inspiration was operating upon Mrs. White.  It appears to 
                      
relate to the vision given her at Salamanca, New York, in 1891, 
                      
but she would remember it in 1905 and see in the Ballenger attack 
                      
an attack upon all the fundamentals of the church.] </font></p>
</blockquote><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Mrs. White, on a number of occasions, equated this law-gospel 
                    
balance issue to understanding the relationship between the 
                    
commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.  She affirmed, &quot;This 
                    
is the law and the gospel.&quot; As she addressed herself to the 
                    
erroneous doctrinal incursions, she likewise would relate to that 
                    
balance.  Notice these statements she made in relationship to the 
                    
Kellogg crisis: </font></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Before I went to the [1901] General Conference, I was 
                              
instructed that I could help you.  The Lord told me that I must 
                              
bear my testimony at this meeting against the incorrect ideas that

here writing A. G. Daniells, Dec. 14, 1903: </font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;There is another 
                                
matter upon my mind about which I must speak to you.  I have often 
                                
been warned against overstrained ideas of sanctification.  They 
                                
lead to an objectionable feature of experience that will swamp us, 
                                
unless we are wide-awake. <BR>
                <BR>
&quot;Extreme views of sanctification which lead men to criticize 
                                
and condemn their brethren are to be feared and shunned. <BR>
                <BR>
&quot;During the General Conference of 1901, the Lord warned me 
                                
against sentiments that were then held by Brethren Prescott and 
                                
Waggoner.  These sentiments have been as leaven put into meal.  
                                
Many minds have received them.  The ideas of some regarding a 
                                
great experience supposed to be sanctification have been the alpha 
                                
of a train of deception.  [This statement clearly has significance 
                                
in relation to her later expression connecting J H Kellogg with an 
                                
&quot;Omega&quot; kind of apostasy] <BR>
                <BR>
&quot;If ever there was a time when our brethren should blend in 
                                
unity it is now.&quot; [Notice her connection between false views and 
                                
unity.  If Satan can foment disunity during times of theological 
                                
aberration, his victory is just about assured.] </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Consider the &quot;exegetical&quot; possibilities from the previous 
                            
statement.  Ellen White has received information from the Lord 
                            
that Kellogg was upon a false path.  The interrelationship between 
                            
the law and the gospel was being upset by &quot;overstrained ideas of 
                            
sanctification.&quot; <BR>
              <BR>
              The interest regarding these statements regarding 1901 and 
                            
the importance upon unity heightens when we consider another 
                            
matter.  At the 1903 conference, both W. W. Prescott and E J 
                            
Waggoner sought a meeting with Mrs. White for the purpose of 
                            
presenting a new view of the &quot;daily,&quot; of Dan 8:13.  This new view 
                            
had been the generally accepted view in Europe probably since 
                            
1898, but seemed to conflict with a statement in <em>Early Writings</em>. <BR>
              <BR>
              W. C. White would later assert that Mrs. White &quot;was 
                            
instructed&quot; not to listen to those views of Prescott and Waggoner 
                            
because they were &quot;mingled with views that were misleading.&quot; We 
                            
recall from the previous testimony, that both Prescott and 
                            
Waggoner held &quot;extreme views of sanctification.&quot; This seems to be 
                            
very close to Mrs. White's reaction when A F Ballenger presented 
                            
his sanctuary views in 1905.  Note again, however, that in neither 
                            
case did Ellen White dispute the theological issues presented. <BR>
              <BR>
              In 1901, on the contrary, she suggested that Waggoner and 
                            
Prescott present their views on the &quot;daily&quot; to Uriah Smith and get 
                            
his opinion.  I don't believe Mrs. White even considered that her 
                            
<em>Early Writings</em> statement should be used to resolve the issue, and 
                            
in fact, she later urged that it not be so used. <BR>
              <BR>
              It seems that Mrs. White always left to the church the 
                            
corporate responsibility of Biblical exegesis. <BR>
              <BR>
              Notice how Prescott reacted to this 1901 experience, as 
                            
Daniells relates his reading of Mrs. White's statement to 
                            
Prescott: </font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I have read with care what you say regarding the question of 
                                  
sanctification as presented in the statements by Brethren Prescott 
                                  
and Waggoner at the General Conference of 1901.  I have read this 
                                  
to Brother Prescott, and talked with him freely regarding the 
                                  
matter.  I can not fully grasp all that there seems to be in this 
                                  
matter from your brief reference to it.  Brother Prescott says he 
                                  
can see very clearly the dangerous path he and Brother Waggoner 
                                  
were traveling in.  He says that it had gradually been dawning 
                                  
upon his mind in England before he came to the Conference.  I 
                                  
think that what occurred at the Conference set Professor Prescott 
                                  
to thinking; for since that time, it has seemed to me that he has 
                                  
taken up the fundamental truths of the third angel's message, and 
                                  
given them a prominence that they have not received for many 
                                  
years.&quot; [Daniells to Ellen White, Jan. 4, 1904, 11 bk. 32, p 929] </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">Through Ellen White many warnings were given the SDA church

              She frequently alluded to Kellogg's misuse of Scriptures as 
                                            
well as his misuse of her writings to support his teaching, but 
                                            
significantly, she never pointed to the particular texts that he 
                                            
misused.  It would seem that there are corporate responsibilities 
                                            
in our relationship with Ellen White. <BR>
              <BR>
              The testimony of Ellen White to A. F. Ballenger, given him 
                                            
during the 1905 General Conference session, reads almost like a 
                                            
replay of the Kellogg testimonies.  Indeed, we can very well see 
                                            
that the roots of their teachings were similar. <BR>
              <BR>
              It would appear, however, that neither of them took the 
                                            
testimonies seriously enough to <em>exegete</em> the roots of their error 
                                            
and it likewise is apparent that the church also failed to do so. <BR>
              <BR>
              Without a close analysis of the times when Ellen White wrote 
                                            
her messages to the church, we will fall victim to many problems 
                                            
concerning the nature of her inspiration.  By close analysis, 
                                            
however, I believe that even such difficult questions as the 
                                            
following can be answered: <BR>
              <BR>
              <strong>1.</strong>  Why was the erroneous teaching allowed to develop for so 
                                            
long?  Indeed, Kellogg could point to statements he had made 
                                            
throughout the 1890's, and published throughout denominational 
                                            
literature not different from what he wrote in <I>Living 
                                            
Temple</I>.<BR>
              <BR>
              <strong>2.</strong>  Why did not Ellen White point out his specific 
                                            
theological errors and the Scriptural basis for refuting them?  
                                            
Indeed, he could even question Ellen White's use of the term &quot;pantheist&quot;, for he certainly believed in a &quot;personal God who sat 
                                            
on His throne in heaven,' as he stated. <BR>
              <BR>
              <strong>3.</strong>  Why did Ellen White publicly praise Kellogg and other &quot;pantheists&quot;, but privately send them testimonies of warning? <BR>
              <BR>
              <strong>4.</strong>  Why did not Ellen White condemn others holding similar 
                                            
theories?  The facts are that Kellogg [a non-theologian] did not 
                                            
originate the <I>Living Temple</I> theology. <BR>
              <BR>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">It would appear that throughout our history the work of Ellen 
                                              
White was closely interrelated and dependent upon a corporate 
                                              
approach. <BR>
              <BR>
              There were times when Mrs. White herself could not interpret 
                                              
a particular testimony and expected that the church leadership, 
                                              
who should have been more familiar with the overall scope of the 
                                              
work than Mrs. White, would, after prayerful consideration, 
                                              
properly interpret a testimony.  The details of her vision 
                                              
concerning the dangers of consolidation provides irrefutable 
                                              
evidence of this point. <BR>
              <BR>
              There were times when Ellen White herself could misinterpret 
                                              
a vision or misstate or imperfectly express what had been revealed 
                                              
to her.  Note what her son, W. C. White stated to Kellogg: &quot;Sister White was not infallible in stating things revealed to 
                                              
her.&quot; There are at least 3 examples where Ellen White apparently 
                                              
misstated or misunderstood something revealed through vision:  Eve 
                                              
touching food in the garden of Eden and death as the result; the 
                                              
number of generations contemporaneously living at the time of the 
                                              
flood; use of the Southern Publishing facilities as a depot. <BR>
              <BR>
              It thus seems that W. C. White's call for a united approach 
                                              
to explain the logic for certain Ellen White counsels was entirely 
                                              
reasonable.  He alluded to the great privilege that was ours by 
                                              
uniting together to combine scientific, Biblical, historical 
                                              
reasons for some of the general counsels given by Ellen White. <BR>
              <BR>
              In this sense, we can see that the church has the 
                                              
responsibility not only of exegeting doctrinal issues, but also 
                                              
those of a more general nature.  <strong>[</strong>Obviously, I am here stretching 
                                              
the meaning of the term &quot;exegesis&quot; almost to the breaking point.  
                                              
But part of our problem in this area is to find some acceptable 
                                              
term that will allow us to deal with the problem.  In the past we 
                                              
have used the term &quot;verbal inspiration&quot; of Ellen White in 
                                              
primarily a &quot;pastoral function&quot;,  but those terms, in my opinion, 
                                              
either do not solve the problem, or create such misunderstanding 
                                              
that all kinds of controversy is generated.  My use of the term 
                                              
&quot;exegesis&quot; is a blatant attempt to avoid controversy.<strong>] </strong><BR>
              <BR>
              Here's how W. C. White expressed the issue: &quot;[Mother] talks 
                                              
freely about the general situation, but when it comes to pressing 
                                              
her to say just what we shall do, she says that that is not her 
                                              
part of the work; but that you must study and pray, and turn, and 
                                              
overturn.&quot; [Letter to A. G. Daniells, date??] <BR>
              <BR>
              Notice the logic used by W. C. White: </font></font></p><blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Lord did not at 
                                                  
any time use the gift of prophecy in a way which would excuse men 
                                                  
from the study of the Scriptures, or from prayerfully carrying 
                                                  
forward the work, exercising their faith in God at each step of 
                                                  
the way.  This is well illustrated in the selection of locations 
                                                  
of our schools and sanitariums.  Through Ellen White, governing 
                                                  
principals were laid down.  The type of surroundings and the ideal 
                                                  
conditions were pointed out.  Then the work of choosing the place 
                                                  
was left with the men in responsibility, who endeavored to find 
                                                  
the place that harmonized with the instruction given.  In this way 
                                                  
those who carried the responsibilities of leadership were ever 
                                                  
made stronger in their work rather than dependent upon the Lord's

we demanded more than the Lord intended and used Ellen White as a

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">We have had the problem of the wrong use of the Ellen White 
                                                  
writings throughout our history.  I believe that historical 
                                                  
exposure can help in the resolution of the problem, without in the 
                                                  
least injuring Ellen White's true role in the church.  In each of 
                                                  
the examples that I will give, the theological issue involved was 
                                                  
eventually resolved by going to the Scriptures for its resolution, 
                                                  
even though many initially tried to short circuit that methodology 
                                                  
by going to Ellen White to resolve it. <BR>
              <BR>
              Because he depended upon Ellen White for exegesis, A. F. 
                                                  
Ballenger lost his confidence in that gift over three words: &quot;within&quot;,  &quot;daily&quot;,  &quot;Babylon.&quot; <BR>
              <BR>
              He depended upon Ellen White in a way that she never 
                                                  
intended for his understanding of the terms &quot;within the veil.&quot; 
                                                  
<BR>
              <BR>
              He depended upon Ellen White's statement in <em>Early Writings </em>for the meaning of the term &quot;daily.&quot; <BR>
              <BR>
              And he relied upon Ellen White's statement in <em>Early Writings </em>for the meaning of the term &quot;Babylon&quot;,  in Revelation 13 and 17. <BR>
              <BR>
              When Ballenger later relied upon Biblical exegesis for the 
                                                  
meaning of those terms, he believed they conflicted with Ellen 
                                                  
White's usage.  In other words he set up a straw man and left when 
                                                  
his straw man failed.  It's too bad, because Ellen White denied 
                                                  
using the terms &quot;Babylon&quot;, and &quot;daily&quot;, in a theological or 
                                                  
exegetical sense.  Scholars have recently also pointed out that 
                                                  
Mrs. White used the term &quot;within the veil&quot; in diverse or non-exegetical ways also. <BR>
              <BR>
              The point is, by attributing to Ellen White a role that she 
                                                  
never claimed, A. F. Ballenger needlessly gave up his faith in 
                                                  
that gift. <BR>
              <BR>
              The same thing could be shown with a host of denominational 
                                                  
leaders who left the church over Ellen White.  Even those who 
                                                  
stayed within the church had to wrestle with this problem.

of his view of the meaning of the term &quot;Babylon.&quot;  After <em>Great

the change concerning that term in the new edition. <BR>

the Biblical exegesis in 1855 on the time to begin the Sabbath, 
                                                  
and he concluded that the Bible supported sundown to sundown 
                                                  
Sabbath observance, some very prominent church leaders argued that 
                                                  
the new view was contrary to the teaching of Ellen White. <BR>

destroy confidence of believers in Ellen White, Mrs. White would 
                                                      
claim that she had &quot;no burden&quot; to prove one way or the other on 
                                                      
that issue. <BR>
              <BR>
              Consider the implication of that Ellen White position:  Ellen 
                                                      
White had written mentioning the Galatians issue in 1857, in 1872, 
                                                      
and in 1883 in the <em>Life of Paul</em> and in several other places and in 
                                                      
all those places it appeared that she had taken positions contrary 
                                                      
to that presented by E. J. Waggoner in 1888.  How then could she 
                                                      
say, &quot;As to the law in Galatians, I have no burden and never have 
                                                      
had.&quot; Her statement, I would suggest, seems to indicate that she 
                                                      
did not consider her previous statements to be of an exegetical or 
                                                      
theological nature, and not to be seen as a hindrance to an 
                                                      
exegetical resolution of the issue. <BR>
              <BR>
              It seems to me that, if we take the position, we thereby 
                                                      
don't need to consider Ellen White as changing positions on that 
                                                      
issue, nor do we need to consider her diverse uses as 
                                                      
inconsistent.  She just did not exegetically resolve theological 
                                                      
issues. <BR>
              <BR>
              Tragically, however, neither the Galatians issue nor the 
                                                      
covenants question were dealt with exegetically and I would 
                                                      
suggest that the church consequently paid a heavy price, for these 
                                                      
were the theological underpinnings of justification by faith.  
                                                      
After the turn of the century Uriah Smith, G. I. Butler, and 
                                                      
probably many others confided that they never accepted the new 
                                                      
positions on those issues.  [Note, however, that at least by 1896, 
                                                      
Ellen White did accept the Jones-Waggoner Galatians position.] <br>

apostasy within the church until its erroneous teachings were 
                                                      
strongly entrenched.  [Some 20 of the major theologians were 
                                                      
teaching the core of the holy flesh error for a decade and most

[primarily the &quot;pioneers&quot;] avoided the fanaticism of A. T. Jones,

natural conclusion from the new views relative to the covenants.  
                                                      
He seemed to have been correct in that the central focus of the 
                                                      
new view regarding the covenants sought to make justification by 
                                                      
faith relevant to Old Testament times.  He seems to have been 
                                                      
wrong, however, in its literalistic applications.  The issue, 
                                                      
however, is that a united church could have been a help to 
                                                      
Ballenger to guide him away from his extremism and also to have

errors needs to be made available to the church.  Here is what I

Ellen White could not be inspired.  He concluded similarly

              Ballenger assumed that Ellen White, as part of her

              <BR>
              Ballenger needed a unified church to assist him.  This was

              As did A. T. Jones, A. F. Ballenger saw justification by

It is certain that Ballenger was strongly identified with the

              It seems quite natural thusly that Ellen White should accuse 
                                                                                        
A. F. Ballenger as Kellogg also of &quot;delaying the return of the

              <BR>
              Ballenger had yet another dilemma, however:  If there was one 
                                                                                        
thing central to the messages of 1888-1890, it was the development 
                                                                                        
of the concept that justification by faith indeed was fully 
                                                                                        
effective <em>prior</em> to the Cross.  This conclusion was reached by 
                                                                                        
those who exegeted on the <em>covenants</em> and the <em>law</em> in Galatians.  As 
                                                                                        
we have noted, however, this exegesis was not accepted by major

Ballenger considered that his sanctuary positions were a 
                                                                                        
natural conclusion from the new positions on the covenants taken

              <BR>
              Let's see if I can restate Ballenger's dilemma:  Ellen White 
                                                                                        
endorsed the new insights concerning justification by faith, but 
                                                                                        
didn't provide the exegetical roots to justification.  Jones and 
                                                                                        
Waggoner provided the exegetical roots, but the new position was 
                                                                                        
not endorsed by the pioneers who believed it was out of harmony 
                                                                                        
with the Ellen White writings.  Now, on the basis of the new 
                                                                                        
position, A. F. Ballenger comes to new conclusions regarding the 
                                                                                        
sanctuary teaching, but his view <em>also</em> contains the aberrant

              The dilemma continues:  E. E. Andross decides to refute 
                                                                                        
Ballenger, but he does so on the basis of the pre-1888 exegesis

              A number of lessons can be illustrated from this situation, 
                                                                                        
but I think central is the concept that the church lost in a

to profit from other segments of the church for certainly his

              The testimony sent to A. F. Ballenger in 1905, if believed by

Seventh-day Adventist church, had a conversation with H. W. Carr, 
    
president of the Western New York Conference. <BR>
    <BR>
    
	Waggoner told Carr that since he found that everything that was in 
    
the testimonies was, in principle, also in the Bible and thus he 
    
found no real use for the testimonies since they became a lazy way 
    
of studying the Bible. <BR>
    <BR>
    
	Carr's response was somewhat stunning to Waggoner.  Carr 
    
asked Waggoner to find in the Bible the concept that the book 
    
    <I>Living Temple</I> contained pantheistic teachings. <BR>
        <BR>
    
	I believe this experience illustrates one of the vital 
    
functions of the gift of prophecy and one that is fully relevant 
    
today:  exposing doctrinal error.  Such exposure is, however, 
    
irrelevant to us today, except as a historical curiosity, as long 
    
as the roots of that apostasy are not exposed.  To expose that 
    
apostasy we need to recognize a corporate responsibility. <BR>
    <BR>
    
	We have one additional great need.  In 1902 E. J. Waggoner 
    
penned a very meaningful statement: </font></font></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;No man drops in one day from perfect faith to gross error; 
          
much less do multitudes of people apostatize all at the same time.  
          
Error is insidious in its working, and the people who fall away 
          
are rarely conscious that any change is taking place in them.&quot; [<em>Present Truth</em>, Jan. 30, 1902, p. 69] </font></p>

with one another, and exchange views and convictions, and humble 
          
themselves before God, and pray together for heavenly wisdom, 
          
light will be given them, and they will be enabled to go forward 
          
unitedly, pulling in even lines, and allowing God to rule.  This 
          
is not after the natural heart of man; it is God's way of managing 
          
His work; man is prone to set up his individual judgment as a 
          
criterion for others to follow....She made plain, perhaps plainer 
          
than before, the possibility of a man's being sincere in his

themes to be dwelt upon which are worthy of more than a passing 
            
notice.  Angels have desired to look into the truths which are 
            
revealed to the people who are searching God's Word and with
