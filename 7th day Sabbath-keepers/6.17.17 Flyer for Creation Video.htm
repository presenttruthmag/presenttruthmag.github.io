  How the Hollywood Movie 'Inherit the Wind' has Distorted <br>
  the Truth of What Really Happened at the Scopes Trial in 1925</span><br>
<span class="style9">Followed by Audience Discussion and Participation</span></p>
<p align="center" class="style1"><img src="6.10.17%20Flyer%20for%20Creation%20Video_clip_image001.gif" width="223" height="297" align="left"><span class="style9">This week our Sabbath Creation Video Series features a fascinating discussion of  what really happened at the Scopes trial. The propaganda of the news media and the movie<em> Inherit the Wind</em> have distorted the facts of the 1925 Scopes trial so much that the theory of evolution has today become the only theory of origins that is taught in secular schools today. Our speaker, Dr. David Menton, uses clips of the film and also news paper accounts of the day to show just how badly the debate between Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan was distorted in order to unfairly favor Darrow and the theory of evolution. You will be shocked when you see how the lies and distortions of Hollywood and the popular media have played a major role in turning modern society against the Genesis account of creation and the plan of salvation as taught by our Lord Jesus Christ. </span></p>
<p align="center" class="style8">Dr. David Menton earned his Ph.D. in cell biology from Brown University and has served as a biomedical research technician at the Mayo Clinic. He also is an associate professor of anatomy at Washington University School of Medicine. <span class="style1">Due to his vast understanding of the arguments of Darwinism he is very able to refute those false evolutionary assumptions with well documented scientific data in support of the biblical cosmology and to defend the biblical plan of salvation through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior, Creator, Lawgiver, and Judge. </span></p>
<p align="center" class="style1 style9"><em>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy..... the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God.....For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</em></p>
<p align="center" class="style1 style5"><span class="style9"><em>And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,  Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.  And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation.</em><strong><br>
