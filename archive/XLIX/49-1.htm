By the unmerited grace of God they are accounted perfect and sinless in His merciful reckoning; and their sinfulness and guilt are covered by His sinlessness. The Law of God finds nothing to condemn in the repentant sinner who believes and continues to believe in Jesus as his personal Savior and Lord. The repentant sinner who  believes in Christ is forgiven and acquitted of all guilt and is reckoned as sinless through the <a href="../../verses-noframes/imputed_righteousness.htm" target="_blank">imputed righteousness</a> of Christ and his name is recorded in the <a href="../../verses-noframes/book_of_life.htm" target="_blank">Book of Life</a>. He is reckoned as righteous in Christ and accounted worthy of eternal life. This is what the apostle Paul calls justification by faith in Christ (Righteousness by Faith). Christ ever lives to make <a href="../../verses-noframes/intercessionofChrist.htm" target="_blank">intercession</a> for  believers as the one and only mediator between God and Man. <a href="../../verses-noframes/come_again.htm" target="_blank">On the Last Day He will come again</a> to give eternal life to all who <a href="../../verses-noframes/eagerly_await.htm" target="_blank">eagerly await</a> His return. </font></p>

Any repentant believer in Christ who afterwards falls away from repentance towards God and faith in Christ as his Savior and Lord will lose his hope of eternal life unless he repents of his high-handed willful sins  and returns to faith. </font></p>
