<p class="style1 style2">An Evangelical Christian <br>
  Confession of Faith<br>
  Part 2. The Denials— </p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style351">This We Deny... </span></p>
<p align="left" class="style1 style5"><strong>Sinless Perfectionism and Meritorious Sanctification: </strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">1. Woe to those who teach that before Christians can enter heaven they must reach a <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Bible/33.html">state of sinless perfection </a>in this life wherein they no longer need to be justified by faith alone and rely solely upon the imputed righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">2. Woe to those who teach that the righteousness by which a believer is justified is a quality <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/7dayadventist/shaking/2.html#quality_in_heart">within the heart of the believer </a>. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">3. Woe to those who teach that God must first <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/LII/1-3.htm#infused">impart or infuse </a> goodness, virtue, and love into a sinner's heart before God can forgive, accept and save him unto eternal life. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">4. Woe to those who teach that the grace of God which justifies a believing repentant sinner is a quality found within the heart of the believer rather than a <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/VII/7-2p1.htm#Grace_in_God">quality and disposition in the heart of our loving, merciful God </a>. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">5. Any teaching which confuses, obscures, or mingles the <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Tracts/victory_effic.htm#imparted">imputed righteousness of Christ with the imparted </a> righteousness of Christ is a serious departure from the word of God. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">6. Any teaching which declares that repentant sinners must be sanctified or <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XXVII/27-2.htm#regeneration">regenerated </a> before they can be justified is a serious departure from the word of God. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">7. Woe to those who teach that justification before God is obtained by following the <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Judgment/19.html#Substitute">example </a> of Christ's holy life rather that by faith alone in His <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Judgment/19.html#Substitute">substitutionary </a>, perfectly sinless life and atoning death on Calvary. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">8. Woe to those who teach that the sanctifying regenerating work of the Holy Spirit in the heart of the believer is at all meritorious and contributes in any way to our justification before God. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">9. Woe to those who teach that a person is ever justified before God by <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/5007/5007_01.asp">obeying </a> the Ten Commandments. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="style8">All have sinned and all continually fall short of the glory of God. There is only one Person who has ever perfectly fulfilled the righteousness of the holy Law of God. That Person is our Lord Jesus Christ. He alone is good. He alone has met all the Law's demands for holiness and righteousness. And He alone is the One with whom the Father is well pleased. Believers will always be justified before the glory of God by the perfect imputed righteousness of the Lord.
          </span>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">10. Woe to those who teach that only sinless, perfectly sanctified <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Judgment/72.html">"Saints" </a> will go directly to heaven. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">11. Woe to those who teach that those believers who have not reached perfectly sinless sanctification will suffer in a place called " <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/V/5-4.htm#purgatory">Purgatory </a>". </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">12. Woe to those who teach that certain believers called "Saints" have attained to such a state of holiness that they are completely without sin either in thought, word, motive, or deed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left" class="style6">Sacramentalism: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">13. Woe to those who teach that God's mercy and absolution from sin's guilt or punishment are dispensed through the personal word and mediatorial office of a person called a " <a href="http://www.catholicsexabuse.com/">priest </a>" and that sinners obtain the mercy of God and absolution from sin's guilt or punishment by "Going to Confession" and contritely confessing all of their sins to this person who is called a "priest" and who is addressed in the "Confessional" with the words, "Father, forgive me for I have sinned...." followed by a complete listing of their known sins. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">14. Woe to those who teach that the partaking of any of the "Seven Sacraments" is in any way essential for the forgiveness and justification of a repentant believer in Christ. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">15. Woe to those who teach that the elements of the <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/LII/1-3.htm#Sacraments">Lord's Supper </a> are actually <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/Lords_Supper2.htm#Supper2">transformed </a> into the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">16. Woe to those who teach that a so-called "priest" is actually <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0074/0074_01.asp">re-sacrificing </a> the Lord Jesus Christ as a propitiatory offering. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">17. Woe to those who teach that baptism is not only a symbol but actually an act of cleansing from sin. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">18. Woe to those who teach that Christian parents should have their little children sprinkled with water or "christened" in baptism. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="style8">The word of God clearly teaches baptism by immersion for believing, repentant sinners who are old enough to believe in Jesus Christ as their personal Savior and Lord. While circumcision of infants was the covenantal sign of the children of Abraham in the Old Testament, the New Testament covenantal sign is water baptism by immersion for believers in Christ who are old enough to have faith in Him. Little children who are not of sufficient age to have personal faith in Christ are sanctified by the believing parent. Children are covered by the blood of Christ because of the faith of their believing parents until they reach the age of accountability.
          </span>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">19. Woe to those who teach that celibacy is in any way a higher state of holiness than that of non-celibate believers. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">20. Woe to those who teach that lighting candles or prayers for the dead are effectual for relieving the "suffering of souls in purgatory". </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">21. Woe to those who teach that the repetitious chanting of prayers (no matter how pious the content) is at all pleasing to our Lord. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">22. Woe to those who teach that the doing of penance ( <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0040/0040_01.asp">"Hail Mary's" </a>, "Our Fathers", pilgrimages, self-denial, or any other form) is necessary for the remission of sin or its punishment. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">23. Woe to those who teach that believers ought to join monasteries or nunneries where they can practice <a href="http://www.savethemales.ca/000691.html">celibacy </a> and devote their lives to poverty, penance, prayers for the dead, self-flagellation, lighting of candles, and other useless forms of sacramentalism. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">24. Woe to those who teach that believers are to venerate, respect, adore, or show devotion to an image, icon, relic, or artistic representation. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">25. Woe to those who teach that the <a href="http://www.chick.com/catalog/videos/0128.asp">virgin Mary </a> was immaculately conceived, was without sin, and that she can intercede for sinners and answer prayers directed to her. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">26. Woe to those who teach that the virgin Mary has been bodily raised from the dead. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">27. Woe to those who teach that believers ought to petition the "Saints" for either spiritual or temporal assistance. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">28. Woe to those who teach that any so-called leader of the church (whether a pastor, priest, bishop, or pope) has the power to either include or exclude any one from the kingdom of God. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">29. Woe to those who teach that the "apostolic succession" of the " <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/Vicar.htm">Popes </a>" of Rome is the way to identify the true Christian church. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="style8">The true Christian church is that fellowship of believers which adheres to and faithfully follows the same evangelical gospel which Christ and the apostles taught. Any <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XVII/17-1.htm">man </a> who teaches contrary to the doctrine which Christ and the apostles taught is an <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XVII/17-2.htm">Antichrist </a> regardless of his claim to "succession" or appointment to church leadership. </span>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">30. Woe to those who teach that the apostle Peter was the first "Pope" and rock upon which our Lord Jesus Christ built His Church and that religious leaders in the church are entitled to be addressed as by the title of Reverend, Most Reverend, My Lord, Father, or Holy Father. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="style8">The true Christian church is built upon the Rock, Christ Jesus the Son of the living God. The "keys" to the kingdom of God which were entrusted to the apostle Peter were the words of his confession of faith in Christ as the Savior of the world, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." Thus, it is the Gospel, not the personal word of Peter or one of his "successors" which contains the key to open the gates of paradise to any repentant sinner who puts his faith in the merits of the Son of God. </span>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">31. Woe to those who teach that church leaders ought to wear clerical attire, vestments, or robes which are distinct from the attire of the common ordinary believer. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">32. Woe to those who teach that certain portions of the fellowship meetings of believers ought to be spoken in a language which the common believer does not understand. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">33. Woe to those who teach that: 1.) the opinions of venerated post-apostolic churchmen called "Saints" and 2.) "Church Tradition" are of <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Judgment/40.html">equal authority with the Bible </a> in deciding matters of doctrine and morals. </p>
  <p class="style1">34. Woe to those who teach that a church leader can issue a decree, pronouncement, or ruling in matters of policy, doctrine, or morals which must be considered inerrant and infallible when this leader is speaking " ex cathedra ". </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">35. Woe to those who teach that divorce is an unforgivable sin and that remarried people are living in a continual state of sin. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">36. Woe to those who teach that the church ought to employ the civil powers of the state to <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/graphics/torture_Judas_chair.bmp">enforce </a>, propagate, or <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/graphics/torture_chamber.bmp">coerce </a> the practice of <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/graphics/torture_rack.bmp">religion </a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left" class="style6">Antinomianism: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">37. Woe to those who teach that any individual person or religious organization has the power to alter, delete, or in any way change the holy <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XIII/13-4.htm">Law of God </a>, the <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/10_commandments.htm">Ten Commandments </a>. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">38. Woe to those who teach that the Second Commandment can be <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1023/1023_01.asp">eliminated </a>. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">39. Woe to those who teach that the <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Judgment/93.html">Fourth Commandment </a> can be tampered with to indicate that the <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Bible/2.html">Sabbath day </a> is not the <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Bible/34.html">seventh </a> day of the week but rather <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Judgment/87.html">the first day of the week </a>. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">40. Woe to those who teach that the Tenth Commandment can be divided into two commandments. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">41. Woe to those who teach that believers need not seek, by the power of the Holy Spirit, <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/VII/7-4.htm">to conform and transform their lives </a>to begin to reflect the <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Judgment/91.html">spirit and letter </a> of <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/VII/7-5p3.htm">God's holy Law, the Ten Commandments </a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left" class="style6">Natural or Innate Immortality of the Soul: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">42. Woe to those who teach that man is by nature <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XXXVIII/38-3.htm">immortal </a> and that those who are not saved will <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Bible/37.html">burn alive for all eternity in hell fire </a>. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left" class="style8">The saved believers will put on immortality on the Last Day at the "first resurrection". Then after one thousand years, the lost will be raised back to life in the "second resurrection". Satan and the fallen angels and the lost will suffer the full measure of Divine justice and punishment according to the record of their sins and then be completely destroyed—burned up by the unquenchable fire of God's final punishment—eternal <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/death2.htm">death </a>. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="style6">Predeterminism and Hyper-Calvinism: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style1">43. Woe to those who teach that: 1.) God has <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XV/15-3.htm">foreordained </a>and <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XXVII/27-2.htm"> elected </a> who will be <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/all.htm#All_the_world">saved and who will be lost </a> and 2.) that the grace of God is irresistible for those thus foreordained and elected of God for salvation and 3.) that believers in Christ cannot turn back to unbelief and be lost. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="style1"><span class="style7"><a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XLV/45-1.htm">Election for the believer is "in Christ". </a> God has not foreordained who will be saved and who will be lost. God's foreknowledge must not be misconstrued as predeterminism. Our Lord died for the sins of the whole world. The Holy Spirit through the preaching of the gospel calls all to believe and repent. It is God's will that all should be saved through faith in Christ. However, the grace of God is not irresistible. Men and women can and do <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/harden.htm"> harden their hearts </a>and refuse to believe to their own eternal loss. </span></p>
    <p class="style1"><span class="style7">It is true that the natural man is in bondage to the prince of this world, Satan.</span><span class="style7">But the Holy Spirit attends the proclamation of the Gospel of Christ and thus enables the hearer of the Word to believe and repent. But those who repeatedly resist the call of the Holy Spirit in the preaching of the gospel are in very real danger of committing the <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Judgment/31.html">unpardonable sin </a> against the Holy Spirit and being eternally hardened in heart when the promptings of the Holy Spirit to repent and believe in Christ as savior can no longer be heard by the unrepentant sinner. </span></p>
    <p align="left" class="style8">The repentant Christian believer is secure in the grace of God and the blood of Jesus "keeps on cleansing from sin" so long as he <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/continue_to_believe.htm">continues </a> to trust only in the blood of Jesus for his salvation and confess that he falls short of the glory of God. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="left" class="style6">"Moral Influence" View of the Atonement </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">44. Woe to those who teach that God does not act to punish, either in this life or on the final day, those who oppose His will, but that the ruin of the unbelieving sinner is merely the natural outworking of sin's natural consequences. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="style8">The word of God affirms the ruinous natural consequences of sin, but further affirms that God will justly punish and destroy all who ally themselves with Satan. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">45. Woe to those who teach that <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XVI/16-13.htm">sanctification </a> is by faith alone (Quietism). </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="style8">The true Gospel teaches that justification is by faith alone. True sanctification however is by faith and works. It is a <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XIII/13-4.htm#Quietism">cooperative </a> work in which the believer has an active part to play. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">46. Woe to those who teach that Christ's death on the cross was not an atoning substitutionary sacrifice for sin but merely a <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XXVI/26-4.htm#moral_influence">"moral influence" </a>. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">47. Woe to those who teach that the atonement for sin was not fully finished at the cross. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left" class="style6">Arianism: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">48. Woe to those who teach that our <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0059/0059_01.asp">Lord Jesus Christ </a> and the Holy Spirit are not fully part of the Godhead—eternal, without beginning or end, all knowing, all powerful, immortal, self existing, possessing life unborrowed and underived. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left" class="style6">Glossolalia: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">49. Woe to those who teach that miracles and <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Judgment/39.html">"speaking in tongues" </a> are a proof of divine favor. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="style8">The miraculous ability to preach and teach and pray in an actual foreign language such as was manifested in the early church is a true gift of the Holy Spirit. However, the nonsensical babbling that is heard today in "Pentecostal" or "Charismatic" circles is an erroneous counterfeit of the true gift. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="left" class="style6">Dispensationalism: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">50. Woe to those who teach that the church will be secretly "raptured" before the final tribulation. (See <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XLIX/49-2.htm#footnote1">footnote #1 </a>) </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">51. Woe to those Zionists who teach that the events of the modern state of Israel are in any way the fulfillment of kingdom prophecy. (See <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XLIX/49-2.htm#footnote2">footnote #2 </a>) </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">52. Woe to those who teach that before the Christian era God saved men by <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Judgment/79.html">the works of the Law </a> and that it is only since the Christian era began that God saves men by grace alone. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="style8">God has always saved repentant sinners by His unmerited grace alone through faith alone in the promised seed, Jesus Christ. </p>

<p align="left" class="style6">Typological Holy Days and Dietary Laws: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">53. Woe to those who teach that the various feast days, fast days, and ceremonial sabbaths of the Old Testament such as Passover, Pentecost, Day of Atonement, and Tabernacles, (which were <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Judgment/32.html">shadows and types </a> pointing forward to Christ) are still to be observed by Christians today. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">54.

  <blockquote>
    <p class="style8">Those who wish to <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Judgment/74.html">tithe </a>, or observe the <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/unclean_foods.htm">dietary regulations </a>, or even be vegetarian may do so as a personal choice but not as a binding rule in the church. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="style1">55. Woe to those who teach that all believers ought to observe "Christmas" or "Easter" as if these holidays were a part of the true apostolic Christian faith. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left" class="style8">Those who do observe these holidays as secular holidays should do so without prejudice towards those Christians who do not observe them. <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1053/1053_01.asp">Halloween </a>, however, is a satanic abomination. </p>

Woe to those who teach that human beings <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFZ1jVO3-OE&feature=related">pre-existed </a> as spirits without bodies prior to life on earth (Mormonism). Also, woe to those who teach that certain "racially inferior" races existed on Earth before the creation of Adam and that the Genesis record of Adam's creation is only the record of the creation of the so-called "Aryan" race. </p>

    <p align="left" class="style8">All of the present-day ethnic groups have their genetic origin in Adam and Eve. There are no "non-human" ethnic groups. All have been created in the image of God even though this image has been drastically marred through the fall of Adam and the subsequent degeneration of the human race since then. </p>

  <p align="left" class="style1">65.

  <p align="left" class="style1">69. The indiscriminate abortion of unborn babies except in cases of rape or when the pregnancy places the mother in life-threatening danger is a serious sin. In cases of rape, the rapist, not the rape victim, must bear the sin for the abortion if the mother choses to abort the fetus. <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1009/1009_01.asp">Abortion </a> as a method of birth control is a very serious sin. Pregnancy is defined as having occurred once the viable fertilized human embryo attaches to the uterine wall of the mother. Birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancy is not a sin. </p>

    <p class="style8">Only the Bible is to be considered as authoritative in matters of faith and doctrine.
