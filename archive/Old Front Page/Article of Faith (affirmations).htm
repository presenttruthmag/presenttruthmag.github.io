            target=_blank>life eternal</A> in Christ. By the unmerited grace of God they are accounted perfect and sinless in His merciful reckoning; and their sinfulness and guilt are covered by His sinlessness. The Law of God finds nothing to condemn in the repentant sinner who believes in Jesus. His name is recorded in the Book of Life and he is reckoned as righteousness in Christ and accounted worthy of eternal life. </p>
    <p>This is what the apostle Paul calls&nbsp;— justification by faith in the <EM><A

            target=_blank>imputed</A></EM><A 
            href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/imputed_righteousness.htm" 
            target=_blank> righteousness</A> of Christ. Thus, we as repentant sinners are <A 
            href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/saved1.htm" 
            target=_blank>personally saved</A> from our sins when we believe the gospel. No repentant believer in the Lord Jesus Christ can be ever be lost as we daily repent of our sins and <A 
            href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/continue_to_believe.htm" 
            target=_blank>continue to trust </A>only in the sinless life and atoning death of the Lord Jesus Christ unto the end of our lives or until Jesus comes in the clouds of heaven on the Last Day. There will never be a point in our lives where we will not need to be forgiven of our sins and justified by God's unmerited grace alone through faith alone in the imputed righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
    <p>All saving merit is in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Faith is merely the <EM><A 
            href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XIII/13-4.htm#cause"

            href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XIII/13-4.htm#cause" 
            target=_blank>meritorious</A></EM> cause. In other words, there is no merit in faith, but rather all righteousness and merit is in the <EM>object</EM> of our faith, the sinless Lamb of God&nbsp;— the <A

                  Just as the believer is reckoned perfectly righteous by faith alone, even so we have the gift of immortality by faith alone. The life and righteousness that we possess now are merely the small down payment of the righteousness and immortal life that we will have "by sight" at <A 
            href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/second-coming.htm" 
            target=_blank>His coming.</A></p>
    <p>After the Fall of Adam, a flaming sword hedged the way to the Tree of Life so that Man could no longer eat of its fruit and "live forever". Thus sickness, suffering, and death entered the creation through Adam's sin. But that flaming sword of judgment has pierced our dear Savior's side, so that&nbsp;— by the unmerited grace of God&nbsp;— the redeemed sons and daughters of Adam will once again eat from the Tree of Life. At the coming of Jesus we shall shout, "O Death, where is your sting? O Grave, where is your victory?" Death has been swallowed up in victory through the blood of Calvary !!!</p>
    <p>And so <A 
            href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/verses-noframes/resurrection-dead.htm" 
            target=_blank>death to the believer is a mere moment of sleep</A> from which <A href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/Bible/1.html" 
            target=_blank>we shall arise</A> to be like Him. In a moment&nbsp;— in the twinkling of an eye&nbsp;— we shall put on perfect righteousness and immortality at the Last Trump. Just as in water baptism Christians are "buried" in the likeness of our Lord's death and "arise" in the likeness of His resurrection&nbsp;— even so we who fall asleep in death shall arise on the Last Day to everlasting life through the promise of the resurrection. The resurrected believers, together with those believers who are alive without seeing death, will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air.<BR>
