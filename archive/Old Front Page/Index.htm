        <p class="style8"><span class="style9"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In view of the overwhelming flood of false doctrine, erroneous belief systems, and godless humanistic philosophies rampant everywhere in the world today, it is hoped that this compilation of the central articles of the true evangelical Christian faith will be of assistance to all who are being lead of God to seek out and find the Truth. The Lord Jesus Christ urges all to "...seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.&quot; For everyone that &quot;...seeks shall find; and to him that knocks it shall be opened." May this "<em>Evangelical Christian Confession of Faith" </em> enable all who are seeking the truth to turn away from the bewildering and confusing array of false religions and come to a secure knowledge the true gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. The gospel message declares in each and every article of faith that without a doubt, "in Jesus Christ, God was reconciling the world unto Himself.&quot; </font></span></p>

    <p class="style14"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The one article of the Christian faith at which the kingdom of Antichrist trembles and gnashes its teeth is the justification of repentant sinners by God's unmerited "grace alone" through "faith alone" in the sinless life and atoning death of the Lord Jesus "Christ alone" as revealed in the "Bible alone". Upon this truth the evangelical Christian church stands or falls. If this article is lost, all is lost.</font></p>
    <p class="style14"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The whole focus of Satan's thunderous attack throughout history has been against this "gate" into the City of God . To breach this truth is to take the fortress of the sanctuary, cast the truth to the ground (Dan 8:11 -25), and destroy the evangelical Christian church.<br>
      <br>
    </font><span class="style14"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now is the time to "restore the sanctuary". (Dan 8:14) The restoration and recovery of the Gospel which the "Little Horn" has cast to the ground is being brought to completion. The church's fierce conflict with the "Man of Sin" is coming to its triumphant close. All the abominable rubbish of the "False Prophet" is being cast out of the temple of God so that the Good News of the fully restored Gospel may be proclaimed to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people!!</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></span></p>
