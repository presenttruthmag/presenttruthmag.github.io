      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1528 &#8212; only a decade after the posting of the Ninety-five Theses &mdash; Erasmus asserted that "the Lutherans seek two things only &mdash; wealth and wives (<em>censum et uxorem</em>)" and that to them the Gospel meant "the right to live as they please" (letter of March 20, 1 528, to W. Pirkheimer, a fellow humanist). From that day to this Protestants have been suspected of antinomianism, and their Gospel of "salvation by grace through faith, apart from the works of the Law" has again and again been understood as a spiritual insurance policy which removes the fear of hell and allows a man to "live as he pleases." </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="4">Sanctification Twice Desanctified</font></b> </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The claim that Protestantism is essentially antinomian seemed to have an especially strong basis in fact in the nineteenth century. Industrialization and urbanization brought about social evils which were overlooked and rationalized by many professing Protestants. Inevitably a reaction occurred, and in the social-gospel movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries one encounters a textbook illustration of what Hegel called the antithesis. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In its fear that Protestantism had become ethically indifferent, the social-gospel movement of Washington Gladden and Walter Rauschenbusch identified the Christian message with social ethics. From an apparent justification without sanctification, the pendulum swung to a "sanctification" which swallowed up justification. In their eagerness to bring in the kingdom of God through social action and the amelioration of the ills of the industrial proletariat, the social gospelers generally lost track of the central insight of the Reformation: that the love of Christ must constrain the Christian, and that we can experience and manifest this love only if we have personally come into a saving relationship with the Christ who "first loved us" (I John 4:19) and gave himself on the cross for us (I Peter 2:24).</font>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">World War I burst the optimistic bubble of the social gospel; no longer 
          did there seem to be much assurance that human beings had the capacity 
          to establish a sanctified society on earth. But the reductionist biblical 
          criticism with which the social-gospel movement had allied itself did 
          not die as easily. So loud had been the voices of modernism against a 
          perspicuous, fully reliable Scripture that in the most influential Protestant 
          circles it was believed that a return to a propositional biblical ethic 
          could never take place. The result was (and is, for the movement is by 
          no means dead) an existential ethic.
      </font>            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P>The Protestant existentialists do not of course go to the length of the 
        atheist Jean-Paul Sartre, who says in <em>Existentialism and Human Emotions</em>, 
        "There are no omens in the world." But when Sartre follows this assertion 
        with the qualification that even if there were omens (as the Christian 
        believes), "I myself choose the meaning they have," he comes very close 
        to the approach of the contemporary Protestant existentialist. The latter, 
        unable to rely (he thinks) on a biblical revelation which is objectively 
        and eternally definitive in matters ethical, must himself "choose the 
        meaning" of Scripture for his unique existential situation. In practice 
        he agrees with Simone de Beauvoir when she says that man "has no need 
        of any outside guarantee to be sure of his goals" (<em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em>). 
        Right or wrong is never determined absolutely in advance; the Bible is 
        not a source of ethical absolutes it is rather the record of how believers 
        of former times made ethical decisions in the crises of their experience. 
        What distinguishes the Christian ethic from the non-Christian, in this 
        view? Only the motivation of love. The Christian has experienced God's 
        love, and so is in a position to bring that love to bear upon the unique 
        existential decisions he faces. This existential approach, at root highly 
        individualistic, has in recent years been given a "group discussion" orientation 
        by such writers as A.T. Rasmussen, who, in his <em>Christian Social Ethics</em> 
        (1956), asserts that existential decision should take place in "the higher 
        community of God," where "Christian discussion" serves as "the channel 
        through which the Holy Spirit moves in the dialectic or give-and-take 
        of genuine spiritual intercourse to provide ethical guidance." 
      <P>The contemporary existential ethic in Protestantism is a second instance 
        of desanctifying sanctification, for it inevitably devolves into ethical 
        relativism. Sartre, when asked advice by a young man who, during World 
        War II, was torn between a desire to join the Free French Forces and a 
        feeling that he should stay in France to take care of his mother, could 
        only say, "You're free, choose, that is, invent." Likewise, the Protestant 
        existentialist can never appeal to absolute law; he can only say, "You're 
        free, choose to love." But what does this mean in concrete terms? Theoretically 
        it can mean "anything goes" &mdash; an antinomianism indeed &mdash; for each existential 
        decision is unique and without precedent. Thus the housemother in <em>Tea 
        and Sympathy</em> who committed adultery out of self-giving (<em>agape</em>?) 
        love in order to prove to a student that he was not incapable of heterosexual 
        relationships, cannot be condemned for her decision. As for Rasmussen's 
        ethic of social existentialism, one can see that it merely compounds the 
        problem on the group level. George Forell has well characterized this 
        approach as "inspiration by bladder control," for the person who stays 
        longest in the group discussion is frequently the one whose "responsible 
        participation" determines the "contextual and concrete" ethic of the moment. 
        The absence of an eternal ethical standard either in individualistic or 
        in social existentialism totally incapacitates it for promoting Christian 
        holiness.
      <P><B><font size="4">Answer of Classical Protestantism</font></B>
      <P>In the Protestantism of the Reformation, antinomianism is excluded on 
        the basis of a clear-cut doctrine of the Law and a carefully worked-out 
        relation between the Law and the Gospel. The Reformers assert, first of 
        all, that no man is saved on the basis of Law. As the <em>Apology of the 
        Augsburg Confession</em> puts it: <em>Lex semper accusat</em> ("The Law 
        always indicts"). Whenever a man puts himself before the standard of the 
        Law &mdash; whether God's eternally revealed Law in the Bible or the standard 
        of Law written on his own heart &mdash; he finds that he is condemned. Only 
        the atoning sacrifice of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the demands of 
        the Law, can save; thus, in the words of the Apostle, "by grace are ye 
        saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
        not of works, lest any man should boast" (Eph. 2:8, 9).      </font>      <P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Three Uses of the Law</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But God's Law as set forth in Scripture, remains valid. Indeed, <strong>the Law 
          has three functions</strong> (<em>usi</em>): the political (as a restraint for 
          the wicked), the theological (as "a paidagogos to bring us to Christ"&mdash;Gal. 
          3:24), and the didactic (as a guide for the regenerate, or, in Bonhoeffer's 
          words, "as God's merciful help in the performance of the works which are 
          commanded"). Few Protestants today dispute the first and second uses of 
          the Law; but what about the third or didactic use? Do Christians, filled 
          with the love of Christ and empowered by His Holy Spirit, need the Law 
          to teach them? Are not the Christian existentialists right that love is 
          enough? Indeed, is it not correct that Luther himself taught only the 
          first two uses of the Law and not the <em>tertius usus legis</em>?
      </font>      
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <P>Whether or not the formulation of a didactic use of the Law first appeared 
        in Melanchthon (Helmut Thielicke [<em>Theologische Ethik</em>] and others 
        have eloquently argued for its existence in Luther's own teaching; cf. 
        Edmund Schlink, <em>Theology of the Lutheran Confessions</em>), there 
        is no doubt that it became an established doctrine both in Reformation 
        Lutheranism and in Reformation Calvinism. One finds it clearly set out 
        in the Lutheran <em>Formula of Concord</em> (Art. VI) and in <em>Calvin's 
        Institutes </em>(II, vii, 12 ff.). It is true that for Luther the pedagogic 
        use of the Law was primary, while for Calvin this third or didactic use 
        was the principal one; yet both the Lutheran and the Reformed traditions 
        maintain the threefold conceptualization.
      <P><B><font size="4">An Essential Doctrine</font></B>
      <P>The Third Use is an essential Christian doctrine for two reasons. First, 
        because love &mdash; even the love of Christ &mdash; though it serves as the most 
        powerful impetus to ethical action, does not inform the Christian as to 
        the proper content of that action. Nowhere has this been put as well as 
        by the beloved writer of such hymns "I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say" and 
        "I Lay My Sins on Jesus"; in his book, <em>God's Way of Holiness</em>, 
        Horatius Bonar wrote:
      <ul>
        <font size="2">But will they tell us what is to regulate service, if not 
        law? Love, they say. This is a pure fallacy. Love is not a rule, but a 
        motive. Love does not tell me what to do; it tells me how to do it. Love 
        constrains me to do the will of the beloved one; but to know what the 
        will is, I must go elsewhere. The law of our God is the will of the beloved 
        one, and were that expression of his will withdrawn, love would be utterly 
        in the dark; it would not know what to do. It might say, I love my Master, 
        and I love his service, and I want to do his bidding, but I must know 
        the rules of his house, that I may know how to serve him. Love without 
        law to guide its impulses would be the parent of will-worship and confusion, 
        as surely as terror and self-righteousness, unless upon the supposition 
        of an inward miraculous illumination, as an equivalent for law. Love goes 
        to the law to learn the divine will, and love delights in the law, as 
        the exponent of that will; and he who says that a believing man has nothing 
        more to do with law, save to shun it as an old enemy, might as well say 
        that he has nothing to do with the will of God. For the divine law and 
        the divine will are substantially one, the former the outward manifestation 
        of the latter. And it is "the will of our Father which is in heaven" that 
        we are to do (Matt. 7:21); 50 proving by loving obedience what is that 
        "good and acceptable, and perfect will of God" (Rom. 12:2). Yes, it is 
        he that doeth "the will of God that abideth forever" (1 John 2:17); it 
        is to "the will of God" that we are to live (1 Peter 4:2); "made perfect 
        in every good work to do his will" (Heb. 13:21); and "fruitfulness in 
        every good work," springs from being "filled with the knowledge of his 
        will" (Col. 1:9,10). </font> 
      </ul>
      </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, the doctrine of the 
        Third Use is an essential preservative for the entire doctrine of sanctification. 
        The Third Use claims that as a result of justification, it is a nomological 
        fact that "if any man be in Christ he is a new creature: old things are 
        passed away; behold, all things are become new" (II Cor. 5:17). A man 
        in Christ has received a new spirit &mdash; the Spirit of the living God &mdash; and 
        therefore his relation to the Law is changed. True, in this life he will 
        always remain a sinner (I John 1:8), and therefore the Law will always 
        accuse him, but now he sees the biblical Law in another light &mdash; as the 
        manifestation of God's loving will. Now he can say with the psalmist: 
        "I delight in Thy Law" and "0 how I love Thy Law!" (Ps. 119;cf. Ps. land 
        19). Only by taking the Third Use of the Law &mdash; the "law of Christ" (Gal. 
        6:2) &mdash; seriously do we take regeneration seriously; and only when we come 
        to love God's revealed Law has sanctification become a reality in our 
        lives. Ludwig lhmels made a sound confession of faith when he wrote in 
        <em>Die Religionswissenschaft der Gegen wart in Selbstdarstellungen</em>: 
        "I am convinced as was Luther that the Gospel can only be understood where 
        the Law has done its work in men. And I am equally convinced that just 
        the humble Christian, however much he desires to live in enlarging measure 
        in the spirit, would never wish to do without the holy discipline of the 
        <em>tertius usus legis</em>." The answer to antinomianism, social-gospel 
        legalism, and existential relativism lies not only in the proper distinction 
        between Law and Gospel, as C.F.W. Walther so effectively stressed, but 
        also in the proper harmony of Law and Gospel, as set forth in the classic 
        doctrine of the Third Use of the Law.<BR>
