        </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The judgment of all men at the end of the world was proclaimed by the 
          apostles as part and parcel of the gospel (Acts 17:31). But the Catholic 
          Church's preoccupation with Plato's idea of the immortal soul rather than 
          the Biblical resurrection of the dead, caused a decided loss of real eschatological 
          hope in Christian thinking. With the Reformation, especially with Luther, 
          eschatological hope was revived and the doctrine of a final judgment upon 
          all men was seen to belong with the great message of justification by 
          faith.
        </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his book, <em>The Last Judgment in Protestant Theology from Orthodoxy 
          to Ritschl </em>(Edinburgh: Oliver & Boyd, 1963), James Perry Martin traces 
          the history of the judgment doctrine in Protestantism. He shows that since 
          the time of the Reformers, the importance of a final judgment has been 
          receding from Protestant thinking. Instead of justification by faith being 
          seen in such a light as to make the judgment necessary, he points out 
          that the tendency is to teach justification by faith in such a way as 
          to make a final judgment almost totally irrelevant. The Calvinistic doctrine 
          of predestination, as well as the old Platonic idea of natural immortality, 
          are also implicated as undermining the real Biblical emphasis on the final 
          judgment. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is very unfortunate for Protestantism, for the message of the judgment 
          has a definite place in the proclamation of the gospel. Prior to the coming 
          of Christ, the everlasting gospel is represented as announcing the judgment 
          hour to the world:
        </font>
<ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having 
          the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and 
          to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud 
          voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is 
          come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the 
          fountains of waters." Rev. 14:6, 7. </font> 
      </ul><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the Church nears her eternal harbor, Satan will be permitted to work 
          with all power, signs and lying wonders (2 Thess. 2:9). The church will 
          be threatened with destruction on the rocks of legalism and the reef of 
          antinomianism. God knows that in order for her to steer safely into port, 
          she not only needs the light of justification by faith behind her, but 
          the light of the judgment before her. It is this light, shining from the 
          judgment bar of God, that will expose the dangerous rocks of legalism 
          and the treacherous reef of antinomianism.
        </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Antinomianism Exposed by the Light of the Judgment</font></B>
        </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bible repeatedly speaks of a judgment, not for some men, but for 
          all men (Eccl. 3:17; 12:13, 14; Acts 17:31). Especially will those comprising 
          the church be judged (Rom. 14:10; 2 Cor. 5:10). The Judge will have no 
          favorites. He will not gloss over the evidence. He will not be afraid 
          to have the lives of His people examined. Every man will be judged by 
          his works (Rom. 2:6-8; Gal. 6:7-9; Col. 3:23-25; l Cor.3:13;4:5;1 Peter 
          l:17; Ps. 62:12; Matt. 16:27; 25:31-46; 12:37).
        </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someone may then ask, "How can this be harmonized with Paul's insistence 
          on justification by faith?" We must be careful to note that Paul 
          can just as fervently appeal to judgment according to works. In his epistles, 
          he calls for concrete acts of love and lives rich in good works. The apostle 
          knows that the only work which will abide that day will be the work of 
          faith and the toil of love (1 Thess. 1:3). Everything will hinge on whether 
          the works have been done in faith. Without faith, the best deeds will 
          only be glittering sins (Rom. 14:23). No wonder Paul insists on faith! 
          A man may be a Christian or he may be lazy, but he cannot be both. Present-day 
          Protestantism needs to hear the judgment-hour message and be confronted 
          with the reality of God's tribunal. Then men will clearly see that there 
          is no room for presumptuous ideas about being saved no matter what they 
          do, nor will there be a place for such sentimental twaddle as God being 
          too merciful (or indulgent) to judge His people. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lutheran scholar, Adolf Koberle, has expressed this beautifully in his 
          <em>The Ouest for Holiness</em>:
        </font>
<ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It is impossible to restrict the statements of the New 
          Testament concerning the final judgment to the ungodly or to self-righteous 
          zealots for the Law, to say nothing of trying to explain them as remnants 
          of Jewish ideas in the theology of St. Paul. The Son of Man will require 
          a special reckoning from those who have been engaged in His service and 
          have been endowed with His gifts. That the returning Judge would reward 
          every man according to his works was told to the disciples. Every idle 
          word spoken by man must be accounted for at the last day. St. Paul regards 
          every earthly tribunal and every earthly self-judgment as unimportant, 
          whether it be approval or disapproval, for that day shall declare it; 
          the day in which the Lord will judge. Then will man's work first be revealed, 
          of what sort it is. Each one will reap what he has sowed. All must appear 
          before the judgment seat of Christ to receive the final judgment on this 
          earthly life. Whoever in the earthly congregation continues to serve evil 
          shall not inherit the Kingdom.<br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        <p><font size="2">"All these declarations that could so easily be multiplied are so unanimous 
              and overwhelming that the evasion of the older orthodoxy, according 
              to which all this is to be understood hypothetically and cannot be 
              applied to the one who is justified, is no longer permissible. At the 
              end of days the judgment will actually be passed on the works of the 
              sinner and of the righteous, and so the fear of displeasing God must 
              accompany even the life of the believer as a holy fear and as an aid 
              in overcoming temptation. Insincere life, an unbridled tongue or body, 
              impure passions, implacable enmity which faith that possessed the Spirit 
              might have restrained or turned aside, will go with us and accuse us 
              before God. But when the idea of judgment on the entire attitude of 
              the one who is justified has been maintained, there will be no room 
              for the ancient antinomian misunderstanding which has always accompanied 
              Paulinism and Lutheranism like a dark shadow; the question whether the 
              Christian cannot continue in sin because the working of grace would 
              thus become so much more mightily evident (Rom. 6:1 seq.). If even the 
              justified sinner must face the judgment it is no longer a matter of 
              indifference as to the degree in which he has allowed himself to be 
              purified by the Spirit from the 'defilement and evil of the flesh.'

        </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While God's people must be careful to maintain good works, they must 
          be just as careful not to trust in them. When the believer faces the prospect 
          of standing before the judgment seat of the Almighty, how can he find 
          confidence in anything within his own experience? As Calvin would say, "For if the stars, which seem so very bright at night, lose their brilliance 
          in the sight of the sun, what do we think will happen even to the rarest 
          innocence of man when it is compared with God's purity?" When Isaiah and 
          Daniel beheld the perfect glory of the Holy One of Israel, they were astonished 
          and humiliated by the sense of their own radical sinfulness. Let a man 
          scale the alpine heights of holy living; yet his holiest duties could 
          not abide the severity of God's judgment. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well might the greatest saint flee from the judgment bar of God in terror 
          if there were no Lamb, as it had been slain, in the midst of the throne 
          (Rev. 5:6). But the righteousness of Jesus will go with the believer to 
          judgment and plead his abundant entrance into the kingdom of glory. All 
          that falls short of God's glory is sin (Rom. 3:23), and in this sense "every good work of the saints while pilgrims in this world is sin" (Luther). 
          But the works of God's people are appraised, not on the basis of their 
          intrinsic worth, but as they appear fragrant with the merits of Christ's 
          intercession. Thus the saints shall be judged in mercy (2 Tim. 1:18) and 
          shall be counted worthy to sit with Him on His throne (2 Thess. 1:5). 
      There is no place for legalism in view of the judgment. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To summarize, two great facts 
        of judgment confront us: the fact of an actual examination of works cuts 
        off all possibility of antinomianism; the fact of Christ's needed final 
        intercession cuts off all possibility of legalism. The Christian shall 
        finally triumph in the same way as he began &mdash; by grace, by blood, by Christ and 
        by faith.</font>
