            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only God's Word 
              and God's Spirit can reveal to the human mind the immeasurable greatness 
              of the Christian's life. The Christian's life is in Christ. It is 
              nothing less than Christ Himself. Says the apostle Paul, &quot;Christ. 
              . . is our life.&quot; Col. 3:4.<br>
              <br>
              From eternity Christ was equal with the Father. He was the glory 
              of heaven. But He laid aside His royal crown and humbled Himself 
              to take man's nature. The Majesty of heaven was born in a donkey's 
              food box because there was no room for Him among men. All things 
              were made by Him, yet on earth He had not where to lay His head. 
              He was unrecognized and unhonored, yet He gave to the world an exact 
              representation of the character of God.<br>
              <br>
              The life which He lived in human flesh before the wondering universe 
              was not for Himself but for us. He was our Substitute and our Representative. 
              Before divine justice we are obligated to render perfect obedience 
              to the law of God (Rom. 2:13). Righteousness is obedience to the 
              law. This we owe to the law, but as sinners we are incapable of 
              rendering it. In our place and in our name, Christ gave to that 
              law all that justice required. His was a life of wonderful humility 
              and infinite perfection. He not only did no sin, but He went about 
              doing good. He was the unwearied servant of man's necessities. He 
              did nothing for Himself. In that royal life there was not one selfish 
              act, rude word, impatient look, impure thought or unholy disposition. 
              In His humanity He revealed every divine excellence and every noble 
              attribute.<br>
              <br>
              Thus St. Paul declares, &quot;Christ is the end of the law for righteousness 
              to every one that believeth.&quot; Rom. 10:4. That. is to say, in 
              Jesus Christ there is a life which totally fulfills the law, a life 
              which measures with all the greatness and grandeur of God's law.<br>
              <br>
              In another place the apostle says, &quot;For He hath made Him to 
              be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness 
              of God in Him.&quot; 2 Cor. 5:21. That is to say, Christ's life 
              contains the righteousness of God&mdash;all God's righteousness in its 
              infinite totality.<br>
              </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              Again the apostle declares, &quot;In Him dwelleth all the fulness 
              of the Godhead bodily.&quot; Col. 2:9. Talk about a Spirit-filled 
              life . . . ! The life of the Man Christ Jesus was filled with all 
              the eternal fulness of Father, Son and Holy Ghost. In this life 
              are &quot;hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge&quot; (Col. 
              2:3).<br>
              <br>
              Not only is Christ's life without sin, but it is a life in which 
              there is no death. Although He tasted death for every man, He &quot;abolished 
              death&quot; and &quot;brought life and immortality to light through 
              the gospel&quot; (2 Tim. 1:10). His is a life which is raised far 
              above the power of death and above all principalities and powers.<br>
              <br>
              As believers, we must confess that our life is all that and nothing 
              less than that, for &quot;Christ...is our life.&quot; Let the imagination 
              take it in. Oh, but it can never take it in! Behold the life God 
              has freely given us in the gift of His Son. He has given us a life 
              which measures with the greatness and grandeur of God's law; a life 
              that contains all of God's righteousness, all the treasures of wisdom 
              and knowledge, all the fulness of the Godhead; a life in which there 
              is no sin, no death; but a life raised far above the power of death 
              and bathed in eternal glory.<br>
              <br>
              When God gave us Jesus, He gave us a life so abundant that Paul 
              could only say that God &quot;blessed us with all spiritual blessings 
              in heavenly places in Christ&quot; (Eph. 1:3). God emptied all heaven. 
              He gathered up the riches of the universe, laid open the resources 
              of infinite power and poured out all the accumulated love of eternity 
              in the gift of Jesus. He would not have it said that one blessing 
              in all His vast ocean of infinite blessedness was withheld. And 
              all this He gave so that &quot;in the coming ages He might show 
              the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ 
              Jesus&quot; (Eph. 2:7, R.S.V.).<br>
              <br>
              The life which God has given us is so abundant that it is greater 
              and higher than the highest human thought can reach. It &quot;surpasses 
              knowledge&quot; (Eph. 3:19, R.S.V.). What mind can comprehend the 
              fulness of the riches of the Godhead? No wonder Paul exclaims:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;Eye 
                hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart 
                of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love 
                Him. But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the 
                Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. . . 
                . Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit 
                which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely 
                given to us of God.&quot; 1 Cor. 2:9, 10, 12.</font></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet if we did not see 
              this &quot;exceeding and eternal weight of glory&quot; &quot;through 
              a glass, darkly,&quot; the overpowering glory of it would blot us 
              out of existence.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;Christ . . . is our life.&quot; Nothing but the Holy Spirit 
              could give us the faith to discover a life so amazing. Faith looks 
              to all that the life of Christ did and all that the life of Christ 
              contains, and says, &quot;Mine are all these works and deeds, mine 
              as much as if I had lived and performed them myself.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Where 
              Is the Christian's Life?</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              In order that this inestimable treasure might be eternally secure 
              to every believer, God took this life out of this earth and placed 
              it at His own right hand in heaven. The Christian's life is secure 
              at the right hand of God. His treasure is in heaven, where no thief 
              can break in and steal it. So the apostle wrote to the Colossian 
              believers:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;If 
                ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, 
                where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection 
                on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, 
                and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our 
                life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.&quot; 
                Col. 3:1-4.</font></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do not fail to notice 
              the location of the Christian's life. &quot;Your life is hid with 
              Christ in God. . . . Christ. . . is our life.&quot; This is our 
              inheritance, and it is laid up for us in heaven. For Peter declares:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Blessed be the 
                God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to His 
                abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the 
                resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance 
                incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved 
                in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith 
                unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.&quot; 1 
                Peter 1:3-5.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through the Spirit the 
              believer enjoys only the &quot;firstfruits,&quot; or &quot;down 
              payment,&quot; of his inheritance here and now (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 
              1:13, 14). He knows that his fulfillment is only realized in Christ 
              (Co!. 2:10), 50 he patiently waits for Him to appear. Meanwhile, 
              the Christian's righteousness is in heaven (Jer. 23:6; Isa. 45:24, 
              25). The city of his affections is in heaven (Phil..3:20). And his 
              real life is in heaven (Co!. 3:4).<br>
              <br>
              Faith to know that our real life is outside of ourselves gives us 
              the courage to face anything. Why need we be anxious about this 
              earthly life, fretting when we do not have things or grieving when 
              we lose them? As Luther could sing with holy defiance as he marched 
              off to the Diet of Worms:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;Let 
                goods and kindred go, <br>
                This mortal life also;<br>
                The body they may kill;<br>
                God's truth abideth still.&quot;</font></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When faced with the prospect 
              of death at the hands of his enemies, Luther remarked, &quot;Let 
              them take my old, wretched life if they will. They will only render 
              me a service.&quot; He knew that his real life was where no demon 
              or human foe could touch it.</font></p>

              What, then, is the exciting discovery of the Spirit-filled life? 
              It is a life lived 2,000 years ago. It contains all of God's fulness, 
              all of His wisdom and knowledge, and all of His righteousness. It 
              is a life of wondrous perfection and infinite blessedness. Through 
              faith that life is ours. It is laid up surely in heaven. It justifies 
              us in the sight of God and entitles us to receive as much of the 
              Holy Spirit that God sees we need until we shall be glorified at 
              Christ's appearing.            </font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In view of this glorious gospel, we are concerned at the direction of much of this &quot;deeper-life piety.&quot; We are concerned because it is causing people to settle on something far less than the life more abundant. We are concerned because people are being taught to look to the wrong life. Their attention is directed inward to their own experience, and they suppose that, having some internal fulfillment of an abundant life, they are ready to go out and proclaim the exciting discovery of their Spirit-filled experience.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="9-12.gif" alt="Looking at the stars" width=272 height=295 border="0" align="left"></font></b>A friend told me of how he climbed <strong>Mt. Palomar</strong>, several thousand feet above a smog-filled California valley. He had a marvelous sensation of elevation and achievement. But then he looked through that great telescope and saw the galaxies out in space, millions of light-years above Mt. Palomar. As he contemplated those distances so vast that they boggle the mind, Mt. Palomar by comparison seemed like an insignificant pimple. So the abundant life which God has given us in Jesus Christ is as high above the highest experience of the saint down here on this earth as those galaxies are above Mt. Palomar. When people glory in their own &quot;Spirit-filled&quot; experience, it is because they have not looked through the telescope of God's Word to see the life filled with all of God's fulness. Instead, they run around, bragging about some feeble experience in this mortal existence. What a fantastic misrepresentation of the greatness and grandeur of the abundant life which God has given us in Jesus Christ!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No wonder the apostle Paul was concerned when he saw the Colossian 
                church being led away from the gospel to look for some fulfillment 
                and fulness in their earthly experience. After telling the church 
                that such fulness is found only in Christ (Co!. 2:9, 10), he made 
              his Christ-centered appeal:</font></p>            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;If 
                ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, 
                where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection 
                on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, 
                and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our 
                life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.&quot; 
                Col. 3:1-4.</font></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again, in his letter 
              to the Philippians, Paul warns the church against those who would 
              &quot;glory&quot; in the &quot;flesh&quot; (see chap. 3). After 
              speaking very humbly about his own experience and attainments, Paul 
              admonished them:</font></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;(For 
                many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even 
                weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: whose 
                end is destruction, whose God is their belly [inward parts] , 
                and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)&quot; 
                Phil. 3:18, 19.</font></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The apostle is not here 
              referring to ordinary worldliness or gluttony. He is issuing a sharp 
              warning against a false &quot;gospel.&quot; He has in mind those 
              who would glory in something other than the cross of Jesus Christ. 
              Their gaze is on themselves. They cannot see any higher than their 
              own spiritual navels. Then Paul adds by way of contrast, &quot;For 
              our conversation [life] is in heaven; from whence also we look for 
              the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; Phil. 3:20. These words 
              are so clear that he who runs may read.<br>
              <br>
              Is the life in which we glory in heaven or on earth? That was St. 
              Paul's vital question to the Colossians and the Philippians. And 
              it is the vital question of this hour.<br>
              <br>
              Just a few days ago a certain Protestant clergy man was teaching 
              a group of children this new (old) existential theology. He said, 
              &quot;Once we used to believe and teach that Christ was up there 
              somewhere in heaven. Now we teach He is inside of us, that the heart 
              is His throne and this is the dwelling place of God.&quot; Now, 
              no Bible-believing Christian doubts that, through the Word and Spirit, 
              Christ dwells in the heart of the Christian. But when this is stated 
              in such a way that it undermines or does away with the pre-eminent 
              doctrine of the exalted, objective Christ at the right hand of God, 
              the door is thrown wide open to mysticism, spiritualism, pantheism 
              and the most sentimental spiritual drivel.<br>
              <br>
              In the Revelation, chapter 13, there are two groups brought to view 
              &mdash; those who dwell on earth (Rev. 13:8, 14) and those who dwell in 
              heaven (Rev. 13:6). That is to say, one class of worshipers find 
              their fulfillment in that exalted life at the right hand of God; 
              the other class of worshipers seek fulfillment on earth within themselves. 
              This chapter is of immense importance to us today. It describes 
              with fearful accuracy where Protestantism is now headed under the 
              influence of so-called revivals (see Rev. 13:13, 14). It describes 
              the final battle between the religion of heaven and the religion 
              of earth. This battle we are now beginning to enter, and the religious 
            world is now being polarized for the conflict.</font></p>          </td>
