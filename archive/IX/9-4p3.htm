              Righteousness</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              The doctrine of justification by Christ's imputed righteousness 
              is not simply one doctrine among others. As Luther constantly declared, 
              it is the basic and chief article of faith with which the church 
              stands or falls and on which its entire doctrine depends. If anything 
              in this article is given up, lost or compromised, warned the Reformer 
              in the <em>Smalcald Articles</em>, &quot;all is lost, and the Pope, 
              the devil, and all our adversaries will gain the victory.&quot; 
              Again he said, &quot;We cannot emphatically and often enough sharpen 
              our thinking on this doctrine. We must devote ourselves to it with 
              the greatest theological diligence and seriousness. . . .No other 
              article of faith is so threatened by the danger of false teaching.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              It can be seen that Luther did not think that the doctrine of imputed 
              righteousness was only something to be preached to mere Christian 
              beginners or that it could be forgotten as a mastered accomplishment. 
              He not only stressed that this truth cannot be learned too well 
              but that it must occupy the central position in the teaching and 
              thinking of the church.<br>
              <br>
              If we were to judge Protestantism by whether or not the doctrine 
              of imputed righteousness is at the center of its thrust, we would 
              have to conclude that Protestantism scarcely exists today. Not by 
              any stretch of the imagination is Christ's imputed righteousness 
              central in present-day thinking or witness. Some will make cursory 
              mention of it, and even most who do mention it relegate it to something 
              which is required at the time of Christian initiation. Apparently 
              it is thought that more mature Christians can get past it and go 
              on to higher things.<br>
              <br>
              </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This present state 
              of affairs in the Protestant movement explains the growing accord 
              between Rome and the neo-evangelicals. No Roman Catholic dogma has 
              ever changed; but with the Reformation doctrine of imputed righteousness 
              removed from the center of the neo-evangelical witness, Rome sees 
              more reason for affinity than for alarm.<br>
              <br>
              It is not hard to demonstrate that Protestant revivalism, following 
              in the tradition of Charles Finney, thinks very poorly of the great 
              Reformation doctrine of justification. The inner experience of being 
              saved or sanctified is overwhelmingly the center of almost all revivalism. 
              It has become a kind of Protestant <em>gratia infusa</em>. Neither 
              can anyone challenge the observation that Pentecostalism, neo-Pentecostalism 
              and Campus Crusade are entirely devoted to a focus on internal experience. 
              It is the old Roman Catholic theology of <em>gratia infusa</em> 
              wrapped up in some evangelical trimmings. For Rome it is a happy 
              eventuality. Catholics are even being instructed to learn the evangelical 
              patter so that they can move in with this stream of religious fervor.<br>
              <br>
              Let us now leave these very obvious deviations from sound Protestantism 
              to examine what we may well expect to be the last fort of the Reformation 
              heritage &mdash; the good, conservative or middle-of-the-road evangelical 
              Protestantism. This is where the shoe is going to pinch. Most of 
              us who are interested enough to publish or read this type of material 
              would like to think that we of all people are the sound evangelicals 
              who recognize the difference between medieval and Reformation theology. 
              But let us also submit to the acid test: Is the doctrine of imputed 
              righteousness really at the center of our faith and witness? It 
              is not easy to be self-critical, but it is time that we let that 
              great truth which calls all doctrines into question, call the content 
              of our own message into question.<br>
              <br>
              We will now observe how the best evangelicals can often fail to 
              keep the great doctrine of imputed righteousness from being at the 
              center of their message.<br>
              <br>
              <B><font size="4">1. Centering on the New Life</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              In their book on <em>Protestant Christianity</em>, John Dillenberger 
              and Claude Welch pinpoint the vital difference between the Reformers 
              (who did believe in the new life of the Spirit) and the sounder 
              Anabaptists (who did believe justification by faith). &quot;For 
              the Anabaptists . . . the new life in Christ through the Spirit 
              rather than justification by faith is the center.&quot;&mdash;-p.63.<br>
              <br>
              And on this same point, evangelical Protestantism today reflects 
              the Anabaptist rather than the Reformation focus. Says Paul Tillich 
              in <em>A History of Christian Thought</em>: &quot;For the kind of 
              Protestantism which has developed in America is not so much an expression 
              of the Reformation, but has more to do with the so-called Evangelical 
              Radicals.&quot;&mdash;p. 225. &quot;Luther's conflict with the evangelical 
              radicals is especially important for American Protestants because 
              the prevailing type of Christianity in America was not produced 
              by the Reformation directly, but by the indirect effect of the Reformation 
              through the movement of evangelical radicalism.&quot;&mdash;-p. 239.<br>
              <br>
              Most evangelical witness tends to lack a central theology of justification. 
              Its overwhelming focus is on the internal experience of being born 
              again and saved. There is much truth in it. The need for the new 
              birth ought to be taught. But when it is not seen in the setting 
              of the pre-eminence of justification by an imputed righteousness, 
              there is grave danger that people come to think that salvation is 
              based on an internal change within their own hearts. Then the focus 
              is inward instead of outward, on Christian experience instead of 
              Christ's experience, on a subjective happening instead of a historical 
              reality.<br>
              <br>
              In the popular evangelical message, people are urged to get saved 
              by inviting Christ to come into their hearts. Being saved is then 
              identified with having that internal experience of being born again 
              by the presence of the indwelling Christ.<br>
              <br>
              Aside from the fact that this comes perilously close to the Roman 
              Catholic principle of salvation by the indwelling presence (as ably 
              set forth by Cardinal John Henry Newman1), it is a far cry from 
              the apostolic message of salvation. The apostles did not begin by 
              proclaiming that their hearers could be saved by having Christ come 
              into their hearts to produce an internal experience. Their focus 
              was not an internal happening but an external happening. Christ 
              lived, died and rose again for the sinner's justification. The apostles 
              proclaimed an objective, historical reality. Here was Paul's <em>kerygma</em>:</font><p></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;We 
                declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was 
                made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their 
                children, in that He hath raised up Jesus again. . . Be it known 
                unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this Man is 
                preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by Him all that 
                believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not 
                be justified by the law of Moses.&quot; Acts 13:32, 33, 38, 39.</font></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Salvation was said to 
              be in something which God had already done outside the sinner in 
              the person of Jesus Christ. As men listened, the Holy Spirit was 
              present to give them faith. Now the hearers were exhorted to accept 
              this salvation by faith. &quot;If thou shalt confess with thy mouth 
              the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised 
              Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.&quot; Rom. 10:9.<br>
              <br>
              Faith does not bring the person of Christ down out of heaven to 
              come into the believer's heart,<sup>2</sup> for &quot;the righteousness 
              which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, 
              Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from 
              above)&quot; (Rom. 10:6). Rather, faith lifts the believer up to 
              heaven and places him &quot;in Christ.&quot; Then and then alone 
              is the scripture fulfilled, &quot;If any man be in Christ, he is 
              a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are 
              become new.&quot; 2 Cor. 5:17.<br>
              <br>
              Rather than the new birth being the result of focusing on the inner 
              change itself, the very opposite is true. We see this illustrated 
              in Jesus' lesson to Nicodemus. After telling the proud ruler about 
              his need of a new birth, Jesus did not lead the convicted sinner 
              to dwell on his internal experience. He directed Nicodemus' eyes 
              to that great external event which guaranteed his salvation. &quot;And 
              as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the 
              Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him should 
              not perish, but have eternal life.&quot; John 3:14,15.</font></p>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            <P><B><font size="4">2. Centering on the Experience of Sanctification</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              The Christian experience of sanctification is a most necessary doctrine 
              of the Christian faith. But when it subordinates justification and 
              takes the center of attention, it becomes a return route to medieval 
              piety. This is the greatest single weakness of the holiness-Pentecostal 
              teaching, and a lot of it has rubbed off on the Protestant movement.<br>
              <br>
              Why does the internal work of sanctification tend to swallow up 
              justification by faith? We shall offer two reasons:<br>
              <br>
              <strong>a.</strong> Arminian theology (which was the soil from which 
              sprang the holiness-Pentecostal movement) greatly weakens the doctrine 
              of justification by faith. It thinks of justification only in terms 
              of forgiveness of past sins by virtue of Christ's death. It fails 
              to see that justification is also the imputation of Christ's life 
              of perfect obedience to the law &#8212; an obedience which gives 
              to the believer a full and free title to eternal life (Rom. 4:5-7; 
              5:10, 18, 19). Consequently, final salvation is thought to depend 
              largely on the active obedience of the believer in his life of sanctification.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>b.</strong> Sanctification has often been separated from 
              justification. When the renewing power of the Holy Spirit is separated 
              from the doctrine of justification, all that is left is a cold, 
              legal, intellectualized concept. Then there is only a fictitious 
              &quot;justification&quot; which brings neither the Holy Ghost nor 
              His transforming power into the life of the church. People profess 
              salvation while their lives are a positive denial of it.<br>
              <br>
              Then what happens? The preacher looks at the church and thinks, 
              &quot;These people have been 'saved,' but they certainly need something 
              else to lift them out of their low spiritual [carnal?] state.&quot; 
              Along comes a &quot;second blessing&quot; or &quot;renewal&quot; 
              expert who proceeds to say, &quot;What these people need now is 
              to learn the secret of the deeper life. They have been taught justification 
              [?], but now they need to be taught the secret of sanctification.&quot;<img src="9-13.gif" alt="Robbers and Thieves" width=320 height=248 border="0" align="left">
            <P>This program is quite palatable to proud human hearts&#8212;especially 
              to responsible people in the church who are supposed to have been 
              &quot;saved&quot; for years. It would be altogether too humbling 
              to admit that what is needed is a true, Bible experience of accepting 
              the gospel, being justified by faith and being truly born again 
              in consequence of it. It is too hard to confess being among those <strong>thieves and robbers</strong> who have really tried to climb over the wall 
              rather than to get into the fold by the one true door (John 10:1). 
              So instead of submitting to going back and entering the real door 
              of salvation, men think it much better to get a second blessing, 
              some baptism of power that will correct their carnal condition. 
              Being outside of Christ, they expose themselves to a false spirit 
              and delude themselves that they are filled with the Holy Spirit 
              because they can do fantastic things like speak in an unknown tongue&#8212;unknown 
              to God as well as to man.                          </font>   <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly justification must be distinguished from sanctification.<sup>3</sup> We must not transfer the property of one benefit to the other. But it is just as certain that they can never be separated. Union with Christ by saving faith results in justification as a judicial benefit, but it also results in sanctification as a moral benefit. One blessing cannot be enjoyed without the other. They are as related as light and heat. Where there is light, there will be heat.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sanctification of the Spirit through a life of active obedience, is not optional. God does not justify the sinner in such a way that obedience to the Ten Commandments is optional. Submission to the Lordship of Jesus Christ is not optional. Faith that is unto justification means that the whole life turns from disobedience and submits to the sanctifying authority of Heaven's government. It is impossible to be justified and not have the renewing, transforming gift of the Holy Spirit. </font></p>            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justification 
           means that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to the believer 
           and that he stands before God as if he were perfect. God must, therefore, 
           treat him as a righteous man; and He does this by giving the believer 
           the gift and infilling of the Spirit. What is needed, therefore, is 
           not a &quot;second blessing&quot; doctrine to add to justification 
            but a true justification which will bring every blessing in its train.<br>
            <P><B><font size="4">3. Centering on Predestination</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              Calvinism has become synonymous with predestinarianism. While Calvin 
              did teach predestination, and a double one at that, it was not the 
              center of his teaching.</font> <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Calvin 
                moved from faith to an elaboration of predestination as a way 
                of showing that God is wholly the author of our faith and that 
                every notion of work or merit must be rejected. . . . Calvin moved 
                from faith to predestination, not predestination to faith. The 
                latter . . . was the pattern of most of his successors.&quot;&mdash;John 
                Dillenberger & Claude Welch,<em> Protestant Christianity </em>(New 
                York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1954), pp.34, 35.</font></p>
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></blockquote>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            <P> As it often happens, people tend to accentuate their controverted 
              doctrines and harden their position in the midst of controversy. 
              As the Reformed doctrine of predestination came under fire, Reformed 
              orthodoxy hardened its position and moved predestination to the 
              center of its theology.<br>
              <br>
              A by-product of centering on predestination has been the reduction 
              of Calvinism into the popular &quot;once-saved-always-saved&quot; 
              theology. In its cruder simplicity, it means that the man who once 
              accepts Christ will never forfeit eternal life even though he goes 
              out and commits the most outrageous sins. This is a far cry from 
              the Reformed doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. Calvin 
              meant that the elect would persevere in a life of consistent piety, 
              and if a man flagrantly failed to perservere, it just proved he 
              was not one of the elect. But the modern mind is seldom disposed 
              to cope with elaborate theology&#8212;perhaps very sensibly it wants 
              theology reduced to a simple, pragmatic formula. And when Calvinistic 
              predestination is reduced to that simple formula, it means &quot;once-saved-always-saved.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Aside from the obvious difficulty of doing justice to the fearful 
              warnings against falling away which are found in the book of Hebrews, 
              this type of evangelicalism cannot help people keep the great doctrine 
              of justification at the center of their attention. Impossible! For 
              if members of the church regard justification as something which 
              was irreversibly accepted by them way back there on the day they 
              were &quot;saved,&quot; justification is relegated to a thing of 
              the past.<br>
              <br>
              The great Reformer who said that justification must remain the center, 
              had an insight into the righteousness of faith which enabled him 
              to keep it central. The Protestant movement today needs to rediscover 
              that insight. Luther fully appreciated why St. Paul used the present 
              continuous tense, &quot;Being justified freely by His grace . . 
              . &quot; Rom. 3:24. With Paul it was not a matter of merely becoming 
              justified and then going on to other things. (Relegating justification 
              to a mere Christian initiation and attempting to go on to higher 
              things was the great heresy which Paul had to meet in Galatia, Colosse, 
              Corinth and other places.) The believer can only continue in the 
              same way as he began (Col. 2:6; Gal. 3:1-5). He must continue to 
              see himself as a sinner who does not fulfill the law, and he must 
              continue to bring to God a righteousness of that other Man, which 
              alone fulfills the law. While God does not impute His righteousness 
              in degrees, nevertheless the believer must always live in the process 
              of laying hold of it and the posture of receiving it. The Christian 
              cannot take his election for granted (2 Peter 1:10; 1 Cor. 9:27). 
              Luther declared:

                no saint regards and confesses himself to be righteous, but he 
                always asks and waits to be justified, and because of this he 
                is reputed as righteous by God who has regard for the humble (Luke 
                1:48). In this sense, Christ is the King of the Jews, i.e. of 
                those who confess that they are always beset by sin and who yet 
                seek to be justified and detest their sins. Hence, 'God is wonderful 
                in his saints' (PS. 68:35), because he regards as righteous those 
                who acknowledge and bewail themselves as sinners, but condemns 
                those who think that they are righteous.&quot;&mdash;Martin Luther,

            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            <P> The doctrine of &quot;once-saved-always-saved&quot; and a supreme 
              emphasis on the new-birth experience generally go along together. 
              What happens then is that people tend to look to their &quot;new 
              birth&quot; experience for assurance of eternal security. Instead 
              of finding all their needed security by identifying themselves with 
              the experience of Christ, they try to find their assurance through 
              identifying with their own past experience of being &quot;saved.&quot; 
              This is one of the greatest single weaknesses of most evangelical 
              Protestantism today.<br>

              <br>
              Perhaps the greatest weakness of neo-evangelism is its overwhelming 
              focus on the indwelling presence of Christ. It is all the more dangerous 
              because the indwelling of Christ through His Spirit is an important 
              New Testament doctrine. But the present-day emphasis is a distortion 
              of New Testament emphasis. It is completely out of proportion. Take 
              a good concordance (especially one which gives the original Greek 
              words) and look up how many times the New Testament speaks on the 
              objective &quot;in Christ&quot; as compared with the subjective 
              &quot;Christ in you,&quot; especially in Paul. The focus is overwhelmingly 
              on the objective &quot;in Christ.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              In the present-day evangelical teaching, there is so much concentration 
              on Christ dwelling, living, working and obeying inside the heart 
              of the believer, that the whole Christian message is sunk into a 
              sentimental, internal mysticism. It is developing into an evangelical 
              &quot;<em>gratia infusa</em> &quot;&#8212;in apocalyptic terminology, 
              &quot;an image to the beast&quot; (Rev. 13:13, 14).<br>
              <br>
              With the risk of appearing too repetitious, we say again that the 
              main New Testament emphasis is not on the Christ on the throne of 
              the heart but on the exalted Christ on the throne at the right hand 
              of God. It is interesting to see what Old Testament scripture is 
              quoted or alluded to most often in the New Testament. It is Psalm 
              110:1: &quot;The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at My right hand, 
              until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.&quot;<img src="9-14.gif" alt="Captive" width=496 height=175 border="0" align="right">The remedy for this sentimental subjectivism is to restore the New 
              Testament doctrine of Christ's intercession at the right hand of 
              God to its proper place. Ever since this mighty truth was cast down 
              to the ground by the <strong>Babylonish captivity of the church</strong>, it is doubtful 
              whether it has been restored to the overwhelming importance it occupied 
              in the apostolic church. When the eye of faith sees the power and 
              efficacy of Christ's intercession of righteousness at the right 
              hand of God, the church will realize that its greatest power is 
              not in an inward experience but in a work going on outside of itself 
              in the throne room of the universe.<sup>4</sup><br>

            The absence of a central theology on justification by faith and 
            the concentration on internal experience, are swiftly moving the 
            Protestant movement into greater and greater harmony with Rome. 
            Will the popular wave of revivalism succeed in turning the Protestant 
            movement into &quot;an image to the beast&quot;? In view of the 
              prophecy of Revelation 13:13,14, we ought to give serious thought 
              to where things are headed in the bond of union which is developing 
              between Rome and the neo-evangelicals. The time has surely come 
              for a &quot;new&quot; Reformation which will restore the truth of 
              the intercession of Christ's imputed righteousness to its rightful 
              place.<br>

            <sup>2</sup> Christ is present by His Spirit in the Word of faith 
              (see Rom. 10:8). The person of Christ remains at the right hand 
              of God.<br>
            <br>
            <sup>3</sup> One error is to confuse sanctification with justification. 
              This is the essence of Roman Catholic legalism. The opposite error 
              is to separate sanctification from justification. This is the essence 
              of antinomian Protestantism.<br>
