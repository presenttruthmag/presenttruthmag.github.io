            <br>
            <font size="2">In his recent speaking itinerary through the United 
            States, this editor had the privilege of friendly dialogue with some 
            fine Christian gentlemen from Campus Crusade for Christ (C.C.C.) who 
            happened to attend his seminars. The substance of these exchanges, 
            taken from notes, is here reproduced<b>. </b> This editor has had 
            a long acquaintance with C.C.C. through careful reading of most of 
            the available literature and by contact with supporters and advocates 
            of the movement.<br>
            <br>
            The comments in the following discussion, more often than not, deal 
            with general principles and revivalism in general. This is done because 
            it would be unfair to single out C.C.C. for criticism that should 
            be directed to the overall evangelical scene. Although the questions 
            and answers were expressed out of deep conviction and concern, a good 
            spirit prevailed in the discussion, proving that Christians can sometimes 
            disagree without being disagreeable.&mdash;R.D.B.</font><br>
            <P><B>Q. What are your impressions of the Campus Crusade movement?</B><BR>
              <br>
              <b><B>Ed.</B></b> The Campus Crusade movement is one of the most 
              notable expressions of American evangelical revivalism today. It 
              has a superb organization that is going, growing and fantastically 
              successful. The office staff at the world headquarters are young, 
              attractive, charming, gracious and vibrant. They and the mainstream 
              of the movement represent the cream of American youth&mdash;educated, 
              idealistic, middle-class. They have an irrepressible zeal and enthusiasm 
              that is contagious. Who wouldn't be impressed!</font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Q. 
              Do you agree with the claim that the revivalism seen in Campus Crusade 
              is part of a great spiritual revival?</B><BR>
              <br>
              <B>Ed.</B> Dr. Bill Bright told me personally that we are now witnessing 
              the greatest spiritual revival seen on this earth since the days 
              of the apostles.<br>
              <br>
              I think you would agree with me that numbers and noise are not the 
              only indications of the value of a revival. We need to take into 
              account the basic questions people are grappling with, or what Nygren 
              would call the <em>fundamental motif</em> of a spiritual movement.<br>
              <br>
              Consider the two great religious revivals that were so revolutionary 
              that they actually changed the course of history. I am referring 
              to the revivals in the times of the apostles and the Reformers. 
              What was the central concern? The basic question people were asking 
              was, &quot;How can a man be just with God?&quot; &quot;How can I 
              be acceptable and pleasing before a righteous and holy God?&quot; 
              The question was theocentric. Men's earnest inquiry grew out of 
              an overwhelming sense of God's holiness and their own guilty standing 
              and corrupt state.<br>
              <br>
              This is not really the basic question that people are asking in 
              present-day revivalism. This has been a very permissive age, and 
              a lot of it has rubbed off on those of us who call ourselves evangelical. 
              God is cast in the role of an easy-going Benevolence who forgives 
              sin out of sheer mercy. There is very little confrontation with 
              the God of law, righteousness and judgment. Few of us are confronted 
              with Luther's question, &quot;How can I find a gracious God?&quot; 
              We take it for granted that God is gracious. Never have young people 
              had so much time, so much freedom and so many means to run after 
              pleasure. Yet they are bored and unsatisfied. The uppermost question 
              they are asking is, &quot;How can life become an exciting adventure? 
              How can I have a bundle of fun? I have tried sport, sex, pot . . 
              . What next?&quot; In the context of this question, revivalists 
              come along and say, &quot;Try Jesus.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              You may ask, &quot;What is wrong with trying Jesus?&quot; Our reply 
              is this: Man's original sin was to make his own happiness his primary 
              concern. (The Greeks called this <em>eudaemonism</em>, which means 
              making the attainment of<em> happiness</em> the goal of life.) The 
              ultimate sin is to enlist Christ as a means to this end.<br>
              <br>
              We seriously question the fundamental motif of much of this type 
              of revivalism. It is egocentric instead of theocentric. It does 
              not change the goal but merely changes the method. Instead of regeneration 
              (the creation of a new motif, a new goal and a new center), it offers 
              sublimation. (Man merely pursues his egocentric goals on a higher 
              level.)<br>
              <br>
              If the current religious fervor is to have any depth or substance, 
              it has to be on a higher plane than eudaemonism. We have to stop 
              trying to deal with God as if He were Santa Claus. (&quot;We believe 
              in you, Santa Claus. Now let's get down to the real thing. Where 
              are the toys?&quot;)<br>
              <br>
              We desperately need to hear the gospel preached in the Biblical 
              context of our accountability before God's law and His judgment 
              seat. Says the Revelator:</font></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;And 
                I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting 
                gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every 
                nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud 
                voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment 
                is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the 
                sea, and the fountains of waters.&quot; Rev. 14:6, 7.</font></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the demands of God's 
              law and the reality of judgment take hold of the ears of people, 
              they will no longer be asking, &quot;How can Christ satisfy my desire 
              to have a grand ball and a bundle of fun?&quot; but, &quot;How can 
              I satisfy God's righteous claims upon my life?&quot;</font></p>

            <P><B>Q. &quot;Present Truth Magazine&quot; seems to be knocking experience. 
              Do you discount the need for a real experience?</B><BR>
              <br>
              <B>Ed.</B> On the contrary. What we are saying is this: The only 
              way to get a real Christian experience is to stop making it your 
              focal point of concern. This may sound paradoxical, but divine truth 
              is full of paradoxes. The only way to live is to die; the only way 
              to save your life is to lose it; you become rich by forsaking all; 
              and so on.

Instead of standing in the center of the stall, she had a frustrating habit of standing at an angle. Then there was insufficient room between the wall and her body for me to operate. The more I tried to push her away from the wall, the more she would lean her body toward the wall. Since she was stronger than I was, I had to devise another plan. I found that by going around on the other side and pushing her toward the wall, she would push back until she was standing in dead center&mdash;just where I wanted her. So I got the desired result by pushing in the opposite direction.<br>

A man or woman who can regale other seekers with his own fantastic religious experience is much sought after to revive the saints. The appeal of almost all revivalism is the prospect of discovering a marvelous human experience. How different is all this subjective revivalism from the objective 
              message of the apostles. These men did not turn the world upside 
              down by telling people about their exciting experience, nor was 
              the burden of their preaching to tell people how to discover the 
              ecstatic experience of a Spirit-filled life. They had something 
              infinitely bigger and more weighty about which to preach. God Himself 
              had visited this planet in the person of Jesus Christ. By the amazing 
              spectacle of a sinless life, He fulfilled the law for all men. By 
              dying on the cross, He took our place, made atonement for all sin 
              and buried our life of failure in the tomb. By the power of His 
              resurrection, He destroyed death, opened Paradise and shut the gates 
            of hell for every believer. Hear Paul proclaim:</font></p>

                  commandments which always hung over our heads, and has completely 
                  annulled it by nailing it over His own head on the cross. And 
                  then, having drawn the sting of all the powers ranged against 
                  us, He exposed them, shattered, empty and defeated, in His final

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gospel is the good 
              news of what God has done outside of us in the person of Christ. 
              It is the proclamation of a historic, objective reality. It is not 
              about our experience but about Christ's experience. This was the 
              central affirmation of the apostles.<br>
              <br>
              The New Testament message of justification by Christ's <em>imputed 
              </em>righteousness means that we are accepted by a life lived and 
              a work done outside of ourselves. The focus is not internal but 
              external. It is Christ's experience that is of supreme importance 
              to us. &quot;By His knowledge [His experience of bitter suffering 
              and death] shall My righteous Servant justify many.&quot; Isa. 53:11. 
              &quot;We shall be saved by His life.&quot; &quot;By the obedience 
              of One shall many be made righteous.&quot; Rom. 5:10, 19. All that 
              is necessary for our acceptance and fellowship with God has been 
              done. There is no need to chase after some elusive, mystical experience 
              to give me status with God, with my fellows or with myself. Faith 
              looks up and says, &quot;Mine are Christ's living, doing, and speaking, 
              His suffering and dying; mine as much as if I had lived, done, spoken, 
              and suffered, and died as He did.&quot;&mdash;-<em>Luther's Works</em> 
              (Philadelphia: Muhlenberg Press, 1957), Vol. XXXI, p.297. Does this 
              do away with Christian experience? Certainly not! It is the only 
              way to have a good experience. Listen to these words from Luther:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                <center>
                  
                </center>
                <font size="2">&quot;For 'gospel' [Evangelium] is a Greek word 
                and means in Greek a good message, good tidings, good news, a 
                good report, which one sings and tells with gladness. For example, 
                when David overcame the great Goliath, there came among the Jewish 
                people the good report and encouraging news that their terrible 
                enemy had been struck down and that they had been rescued and 
                given joy and peace; and they sang and danced and were glad for 
                it [1 Sam. 18:6].</font></font></p>
              <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Thus this 
              gospel of God or New Testament is a good story and report, sounded 
              forth into all the world by the apostles, telling of a true David 
              who strove with sin, death, and the devil, and overcame them, and 
              thereby rescued all those who were captive in sin, afflicted with 
              death, and overpowered by the devil. Without any merit of their 
              own he made them righteous, gave them life, and saved them, so that 
              they were given peace and brought back to God. For this they sing, 
              and thank and praise God, and are glad forever, if only they believe 
              firmly and remain steadfast in faith.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;This report and encouraging tidings, or evangelical and divine 
              news, is also called a New Testament. For it is a testament when 
              a dying man bequeaths his property, after his death, to his legally 
              defined heirs. And Christ, before his death, commanded and ordained 
              that his gospel be preached after his death in all the world [Luke 
              24:44-47]. Thereby he gave to all who believe, as their possession, 
              everything that he had. This included: his life, in which he swallowed 
              up death; his righteousness, by which he blotted out sin; and his 
              salvation, with which he overcame everlasting damnation. A poor 
              man, dead in sin and consigned to hell, can hear nothing more comforting 
              than this precious and tender message about Christ; from the bottom 
              of his heart he must laugh and be glad over it, if he believes it 
              true.&quot;&mdash;<em>Selected Writings</em>, Vol. IV, pp.394, 395. </font>

            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To learn that my acceptance 
            with God is grounded on something entirely outside my own experience, 
            brings the joy of sheer freedom. When faith grasps that my righteousness,

            I am liberated from all this internal groveling. Christ, my Representative, 
            is accepted at the right hand of God; my Substitute is pleasing to

              <br>
              <B>Ed.</B> Many stuffy, old churches need the youthful enthusiasm 
              of people like the Campus Crusaders. But we need to be careful that 
              our enthusiasm is in the objective gospel rather than in our own 
              subjective experience.<br>
              <br>
              Mary Magdalene was certainly enthusiastic when she ran to the disciples 
              with the news of her risen Lord. But she didn't regale them with 
              details of how she felt. Peter did not bore his listeners on the 
              Day of Pentecost with a dry, theological discourse, nor did he tell 
              them about his exciting experience of being filled with the Spirit.<br>
              <br>
              I read in a recent paper, &quot;The kids are very excited about 
              what Jesus is doing in their lives.&quot; I met one of them&mdash;a fine, 
              nineteen-year<font size="3">-old co-ed<B>.</B> </font>Asked to tell 
              what she was so enthusiastic about, she said, &quot;I am excited 
              about what Jesus is doing in my life. It is just like being in love. 
              At times I am so excited I could lie down on the ground and scream.&quot; 
              Six months later she added this: &quot;I have not yet recovered 
              from the awful after-depression of it.&quot;

  There are two aspects of God's work&mdash;His work for us and His work in us. Faith must be grounded on His work for us. That is the gospel. It is the only thing big enough for security. Ten thousand ecstatic experiences won't save us or give us any status with God. The essence of God's work within us is to teach us to rely wholly on His work without us.</font></p>

                are going to be a lot of frustrated people about soon. History has 
                furnished us with two great experiments in seeking internal fulfillment. 
                First, the medieval church demonstrated the results of trying to 
                find fulfillment in an internal experience. (In classical theology 
                this was called <em>gratia infusa</em>.) The result was some of 
                the greatest ignorance, superstition and religious corruption that 
                the world has ever seen. Second, the Renaissance has demonstrated 
                the results of trying to find fulfillment in humanism, rationalism, 
                and material and scientific idealism. The age in which man has reached 
                the moon is the most bewildered, disillusioned and frustrated age 
                in civilized history.<br>
              <br>
              Shall we now return to the medieval principle of seeking fulfillment 
              and satisfaction in internal, spiritual experience? This is where 
              popular revivalism is now head<b>.</b><br>
              <br>
              The great Reformation of the sixteenth century grew out of an awakening 
              to the fact that life cannot be fulfilled within the historical 
              process&mdash;with or without grace. This is the very substance of what 
              the Reformers discovered in the doctrine of original sin. Human 
              nature is radically corrupt, and this corrupt nature remains even 
              in Christians until they die. &quot;Every good work of the saints 
                while pilgrims in this world is sin,&quot; declared Luther when 
                writing against Latomus from the Wartburg &mdash; meaning that because 
                of the taint of human imperfection, no saint could satisfy the demands 
                of God's law. Even the good deeds of holy prophets are filthy rags 
                when compared with the righteousness which the law demands (Isa. 
                64:6). &quot;O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from 
                the body of this death?&quot; (Rom. 7:24). Such was the confession 
                of a Spirit-filled apostle. All continue to fall short of God's 
                glory (Rom. 3:23), and not even the best saint at his best state 
                with his best deed, can satisfy the righteousness demanded by God's 
                law. So the fact of original sin means that no man can experience 
                fulfillment within the historical process.<br>
              <br>
              The Reformers found the solution to the human dilemma in the Pauline 
            doctrine of righteousness by faith &#8212; or the <em>imputed</em> righteousness 
                of Christ. This means that Christ is the one ideal Man, the only 
                One in whom God's purpose is fulfill<b>. </b>In Him every human 
                aspiration meets its total fulfillment, and in Him the law finds 
                entire satisfaction. In Him human nature is perfected, accepted 
                and restored to fellowship at the right hand of God. He is our Man, 
                His humanity is ours, and His righteousness is ours. Instead of 
                trying to find fulfillment in ourselves, faith finds it outside 
                of ourselves in the person of Christ. Says the apostle Paul, &quot;Your 
                own completeness is only realized in Him.&quot; Col. 2:10, Phillips.<br>
              <br>
              Within the historical process, this fulfillment is ours only by 
            faith, never by empirical reality until Christ shall come again. 
            In the present gift of the Holy Spirit, we have but the down payment 
            and first fruits of that inheritance (Eph. 1:13, 14; Rom. 8:23); 
            and instead of gloating in smug satisfaction about the enjoyment 
            of spiritual fulfillment, &quot;we . . . groan within ourselves, 
                waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body&quot; (Rom. 8:23).</font> </div>              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again we say, the principle of imputed righteousness teaches us 
              that we can find no internal fulfillment within the historical process. 
              Sin dwells yet in the best of saints (Eccl.. 7:20; 1 John 1:8). 
              Within there still remain things to perplex, discourage and frustrate. 
              Our fulfillment is outside of ourselves in the person of Jesus Christ. 
              We take consolation in His completeness, His righteousness, knowing 
              by faith that all which He is, God ascribes to us, and all that 
              He has belongs to us. No experience, absolutely none but His, will 
              ever satisfy. Any man who is sufficiently enlightened to know that 
              his own inner experience cannot satisfy the ideal of God's law, 
              will also know that it can't \satisfy himself.<br>

              <img src="9-8.gif" alt="Pigs to the Water" width=512 height=407 border="0" align="right">It is a sad spectacle to see this mad, Gadarene<strong> stampede </strong>after a 
              satisfying inner experience. Yet crusaders and revivalists tell 
              people that they can have it, deluded enthusiasts proclaim that 
              they have attained it, and books spell out secret formulas about 
              how to get it. It is sheer &quot;evangelical&quot; Romanism. In 
              fact, some Roman Catholic scholars are very critical (and rightly 
              so) of the extreme subjectivism manifested by Protestant revivalism. </font>

            <P><B>Q. Didn't Jesus tell us that He came to give us an abundant 
              life?</B><BR>
              <br>
              <B>Ed.</B> Yes, it is a life filled with all the fulness of the 
              Godhead (Col. 2:9) and all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge 
              (Col. 2:3). That life is laid up for us at the right hand of God, 
              and we are directed to wait for Christ's coming for the empirical 
              possession of it (Col. 3:1-4). Meanwhile, it is ours by faith; 
              and by the gift of the Holy Spirit, we now enjoy only the &quot;firstfruits,&quot; 
              or down payment, of it (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 1:14).<br>
              <br>
              Our complaint against the popular &quot;deeper-life&quot; movement 
              is not that it makes this &quot;abundant life&quot; too wonderful. 
              It does not present it as wonderful enough. It reduces it to the 
              imperfect state of Christian experience here below, where &quot;the 
              flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh&quot; 
              (Gal. 5:17).            
            <img src="9-10.gif" alt="Runaway Bride" width=512 height=228 border="0" align="left">
            <P>Those who reduce the &quot;abundant life&quot; to the life here 
              and now, have no true perspective of the hope of Christ's coming. 
              They are like a bride who wants to have her <strong>honeymoon </strong>without the 
              personal presence of the bridegroom. The New Testament focuses on 
              two great events&mdash;the first coming of Christ and His return in glory. 
              Faith is directed to the finished work of His first advent and possesses 
              that abundant life by faith. Hope is directed to the second 
              advent, &quot;when Christ, who is our life, shall appear&quot; and 
              bestow that life upon us by empirical reality. If we try to bring 
              the &quot;not yet&quot; into the now, we will have a very poor substitute 
              for the real thing&mdash;as well as lose the eschatological tension of 
              the New Testament message.<br>
              <br>
              Besides looking to the wrong life, this &quot;radiant Christian 
              experience&quot; mentality gives a romanticized coloring to Christian 
              sanctification. Bible sanctification is not a mystical, spiritual 
              rapture. It is not a happy flight of feeling. It is not taking off 
              on some mystical, spiritual trip. Bible sanctification means trusting 
              God in trial, in darkness as well as in the light; it is walking 
              by faith and not by sight; it is consistently obeying every word 
              from the mouth of God and steadfastly doing His will. In other words, 
              it is not measured by the state of religious feelings and is quite 
              different from some kind of spiritual euphoria. True Christian experience 
              does not always appear to be a spectacular adventure. But to fusslessly 
              trust God and keep His commandments is worth more than all the noise 
              of Christendom.
            <P><B>Q. On what basis do you say that most of today's evangelical 
              revivalism is more akin to Romanism than to the Reformation?</B><BR>
              <br>
              <B>Ed.</B> The main difference between the Reformers and Rome was 
              a matter of emphasis. The Reformation doctrine of justification 
              by an imputed righteousness meant that the sinner's faith was directed 
              to a work of grace outside of himself. The fundamental emphasis 
              was on the objective reality of Christ's experience on the sinner's 
              behalf. The Roman doctrine of justification by an infused righteousness 
              meant that the sinner's attention was directed to an inward work 
              of grace. The fundamental emphasis was on the subjective experience 
              of Christ's indwelling in the heart.<br>

              </center>
              Although most Protestant revivalism may give lip acknowledgment 
              to the doctrine of imputed righteousness, the fundamental motif 
              is subjective experientialism. It is therefore more in harmony with 
              the non-Reformation tradition.<br>
              <br>
              Groups like Campus Crusade will find that they are more at home 
              working in common cause with Roman Catholics than with Protestants 
              who return to the objective Reformation emphasis of law and gospel. 
            In fact, this is already beginning to be clearly demonstrated<b>.</b>

              see a true revival. In what direction should we move?</B><BR>
              <br>
            <B>Ed.</B> Well, consider the following: </font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="5"><strong>1. </strong></font>In order to steer clear of shallow, sentimental revivalism, 
                we need a strong, virile emphasis on law and gospel. The righteous 
                demands of God's law need to be set forth in such a way that men 
                may start crying out, &quot;How can I be just in the sight of God?&quot; 
              rather than asking, &quot;How can I escape the boredom of life and 
                have a bundle of fun?&quot; If the gospel is not preached in the 
                context of God's judgment (Rev. 14:6, 7) and the deep conviction 
                of the sinfulness of sin, it will have no real power to move people 
                from death to life.<br>
              <br>
              <font size="5"><strong>2. </strong></font>The doctrine of justification by an imputed righteousness must 
                be moved to the center of attention (see article, &quot;The Centrality 
                of Justification by an Imputed Righteousness,&quot; this issue). 
                This will prevent the language of Christian experience from becoming 
                too loud and confident.<br>

              <img src="9-11.gif" alt="Like Cows in Egypt" width=480 height=231 border="0" align="right"><strong><font size="5">3.</font></strong> Campus Crusade should abandon its &quot;second blessing&quot; 
              theology, evidenced in its doctrine of &quot;carnal Christians&quot; 
              and &quot;Spirit-filled Christians&quot; as well as its liberal 
                quoting from &quot;holiness&quot; authors in its literature. Its 
                doctrine of sanctification completely swallows up justification 
                just as <strong>Pharaoh's lean cattle </strong>swallowed up his fat ones. Campus 
                Crusade doctrine is decidedly holiness-Pentecostal, although it 
                eschews speaking in tongues. This explains why many in the movement 
                keep gravitating into Pentecostalism.<br>
              <br>
              <font size="5"><strong>4. </strong></font>The doctrine of &quot;Christ in you&quot; needs to be delivered 
                from serious distortion by placing the greatest emphasis where the 
                New Testament places it&mdash;on God's work in Christ and the believer's 
                position in Christ.<br>
              <br>
              <font size="5"><strong>5. </strong></font>The New Testament has far more to say about Christ's intercession 
                in heaven than His indwelling in the heart. Christ will never be 
                truly on the throne of the heart until faith sees Him exalted on 
              the throne at the right hand of God.</font>            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If the revival is based solidly on the New Testament, it can end 
                in glorious fulfillment at the second coming of Jesus Christ. Otherwise, 
                it will lead millions to unite in fulfilling Revelation 13:13, 14. 
                Protestantism is clearly headed for the crisis. </font>
