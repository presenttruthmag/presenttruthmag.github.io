              <br>
              Power is an important word in the religious world as well as in the 
              business world. We hear a lot about power from those who are promoting 
              revival, renewal or Pentecostalism. It is said that Christians today 
              need spiritual power within them so that they can turn the world upside 
              down for Christ.<br>
              <br>
              Now I believe in the power of &quot;Christ within,&quot; or the power 
              of the indwelling Spirit. But I submit that our faith needs to be 
              in something bigger than an internal experience before we shall see 
              a revival of apostolic power.<br>
              <br>
              Let me illustrate my point from the world of business and economics. 
              If a businessman aspires to power in the world of business, he needs 
              something more than personal inward resources such as brains, money 
              and executive ability. These are important of course, but he needs 
              the help of resources outside himself. If he has only his own inward 
              strength and money to work for him, he is greatly limited. He needs 
              the strength of another's capital. We call it credit. A proper use 
              of credit is the businessman's greatest skill. Credit is power.<br>
              <br>
              How did the great business tycoons manage to rise from nowhere and 
              build a financial empire? By a skillful use of the resources of others! 
              If they had merely worked on resources within their own head, their 
              own muscles and their own banking account, you would never have heard 
              of their success stories. None of them could rise to power without 
              credit. They not only got their own resources to work for them, but 
              other people's resources. We call this method capitalism.</font></p>

              <br>
              Max Weber and other scholars have observed that there is a relation 
            between the Protestant Reformation and the rise of modern capitalism. 
            I would like to point out one interesting parallel. Capitalism cannot 
            exist without credit, and Protestantism cannot exist without imputed 
            righteousness. When men learned how to use credit and put it to 
            work for them, capitalism was born. When men learned how Christ's 
            righteousness was credited (imputed) to the believer, Protestantism 
            was born.<br>
              <br>
              In fact, there even appears to be evidence that the Protestant awakening 
              brought light and progress on many fronts&mdash;not the least an economic 
              awakening. Economic progress followed in the wake of the Reformation. 
              In every country Protestants became the nation's merchants. The 
              Protestant nations became the most prosperous.<br>
              <br>
              It is written in the Bible that Jacob had power with God. That is 
              the greatest power a man can have. The medieval church tried to 
              obtain power with God on the basis of an inward infusion of righteousness. 
              Men looked inwardly, thinking that this was their only means of 
              spiritual power. Economic practices were not much more enlightened. 
              Men traded with &quot;real&quot; money such as gold, goods and perhaps 
                  services. It was very close to, if not very often, a real barter 
                  system.<br>
              <br>
                <B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="9-18.gif" alt="The Vault" width=272 height=186 border="0" align="left"></font><font size="4">The New Thinking</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              The Reformation taught men to think differently. They rediscovered 
            the Pauline principle of imputed righteousness. They saw that Christ 
            had provided for man an infinite fund of moral power. God has made 
            its use dependent upon faith. As soon as the sinner believes in 
            the doing and dying of Christ, God places the righteousness of His 
            Son to the sinner's account in the<strong> bank of heaven.</strong> The righteousness 
            of Christ is the sum total of God's righteousness (Rom. 3:21, 22; 
            2 Cor. 5:21). No man could contain it all within himself anymore 
            than he could carry away a billion dollar bills in a couple of suitcases. 
            Yet God gives all of Christ's omnipotent righteousness to the believer, 
            and the way He does it is by imputation. With all these resources 
            to his credit, the believer has some real power behind him. One 
            great aspect of the Holy Spirit's power is to give the Christian 
            wisdom to use and depend upon that infinite credit. The power of 
            imputed righteousness is the sum total of the power of Christ's 
            life. Think about it!<br>
              <br>
              Imagine a struggling businessman, hemmed in by lack of capital, 
              with all his inward resources at the stretch, going in to see the 
              Bank of America for help. The president tells him, &quot;You can 
                  have to your credit all the money of this great bank. Here's the 
                  check book. Use our name.&quot; That man might not walk around with 
                  the exhilarating sense of inward power (for in himself his resources 
                  are very limited), but he would have a vast appreciation of the 
              power in the name and credit of Bank of America. </font></p>

              <br>
              It is amazing how Protestants are now showing so little appreciation 
              for the pre-eminent importance of imputed righteousness. Yet it 
              was this concept that gave birth to the Reformation. If it dies 
              out, Protestantism will die out.<br>
              <br>
              The Roman Catholic Church has shown nothing but contempt for the 
              Protestant doctrine of imputed righteousness. They call it a weak, 
              unreal, &quot;as if&quot; righteousness. They never cease to marvel 
              that Protestants can see any virtue in a righteousness wholly outside 
              the believer. In contrast, they contend that a man is justified 
              before God by a &quot;real,&quot; &quot;transforming,&quot; &quot;inward&quot; 
              righteousness. Imputed righteousness sounds too much like &quot;pie 
              in the sky&quot; for the realistic Catholic mind, so they prefer 
              to talk about an infused righteousness which is substantially inside 
              the believer's heart. Most Protestants today are really thinking 
              like Catholics rather than Protestants. They are doing it without 
              realizing it. All the concentration is on the power of an inner 
              experience of some sort.<br>
              <br>
              I remember talking to a Christian friend of mine who seemed to express 
              the generally low estimate this age has on imputed righteousness. 
              My friend said, &quot;Imputed righteousness is just like paper money. 
              It's better to possess the real McCoy. Imputed righteousness is 
              only a paper transaction. It's much better to have the real inward 
              experience.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              I replied to him, &quot;Bob, you would want to work on better principles 
              than that if you should ever aspire to rise to the top in the business 
              world. You disparage paper transactions and think that dealing with 
              'real' currency is better. That's like the little corner store which 
              has the notice displayed above the counter, saying, 'We buy for 
              cash, and we sell for cash.' That is why it remains a little corner 
              store. But how is all the really big business transacted&mdash;business 
              that controls the flow of multimillions of dollars, thousands of 
              men, resources of great business empires which belt the world? By 
              'paper transactions' if you please! Big business is accomplished 
              by legal, paper transactions! When the big corporation needs a vast 
              amount of capital to carry on, it gets some credit. The bank merely 
              writes down something on a piece of paper. That corporation acts 
              on the faith of that paper transaction, and things really happen. 
              So if Christians are going to have power to turn the world upside 
              down, they need a lot of credit. It is freely available if they 
              only have faith to apply for it and faith to act on it.&quot;</font><br>

              <br>
              Let us call the doctrine of imputation &quot;divine credit&quot; &mdash; for that is what it is. This credit not only gives us power to 
              act; it gives God power to act. Let us see this in the light of 
              the great transaction of atonement.<br>
              <br>
              Our sins were imputed to Christ. This did not make Christ a sinner, 
              but He was <strong>regarded as a sinner</strong>. Imputation does not change the 
              object; it changes the way the object is regarded. Now although 
              Jesus was in Himself perfectly righteous and pleasing to God, the 
              imputation of our sins to Him made Him appear as if He were a sinner 
              and abhorrent in the sight of God. This was no make believe with 
              God. God treated His Son, not on the basis of what He was in Himself, 
              but on the basis of what He was by imputation. The sword of divine 
              justice was unsheathed upon Him, and He died cursed, rejected and 
              condemned by the guilt of the world's sin.</font>            </p>            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the basis of this atonement, God can now be just and at the same time impute (credit) the sinless life of Christ to the believer (Rom. 3:26). Although he is sinful in himself and abhorrent to the holiness of God, the imputation of Christ's righteousness to the believer makes him appear before God as if he were as righteous as Jesus. This is no make believe with God. God is now able, without any compromise to justice, to treat this sinner as if he were righteous. He gives him the gift and infilling of the Spirit, the ministry of angels, the protection of His law, the seal of sonship, and all the resources of heaven to his aid. The believer may not always live, feeling like he has some exhilarating power within him. In fact, he often feels quite desperately empty and sinfully weak. But being satisfied that Christ stands surety for him, he proceeds to act by faith in his credit with the bank of heaven. As he steps out in faith to obey God and to resist sin, he finds that he &quot;can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth&quot; him. </font>                          </font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christ's righteousness is not imputed to us to release us from the necessity of moral and ethical action but to give us all the rights and titles to act as sons of God &mdash; or as Paul says, &quot;that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit&quot; (Rom. 8:4).</font></p>            </td>
