              <br>
              All who are acquainted with the epistle to the Colossians exult 
              in its Christ-exalting tone and content. After his prayer of thanksgiving 
              (1:3-12), Paul expatiates on the supremacy of the Son of God (1:13-20), 
              reconciliation through His death (1:21-23) and the glorious secret 
              of God, &quot;hidden for long ages and through many generations&quot; 
              (1:26, N.E.B.). &quot;The secret is this: Christ in you, the hope 
              of a glory to come&quot; (1:27, NEB.; cf. also 2:3). Paul stresses 
              the fact that he speaks to the Colossians about Christ Himself being 
              the secret &mdash; the Christ in whom is hidden all (2:3) &mdash; to save them 
              from being talked into error by specious arguments (2:4).<br>
              <br>
              What was the danger against which the apostle was so earnestly warning 
              the Colossians? The danger was nothing less than confusing the shadow 
              with the reality! (2:17, N.E.B.). The &quot;shadow&quot; in this 
              instance was empirical piety-regulations concerning eating and drinking 
              (2:16), observances (2:16), self-mortification, angel worship and 
              private revelations (2:18) &mdash; and the &quot;solid reality&quot; was 
              Christ (2:17), the Head (2:19). To embrace an empirical, piety-centered 
              religion is to embrace a shadow and to lose the solid reality. It 
              is to give oneself to the perishable, the precepts of men, and to 
              lose hold on the imperishable, the precept of God (2:22). To confuse 
              the shadow with solid reality, to concentrate upon the rigoristic 
              and self-mortifying activity, gives a great appearance of spirituality; 
              but in actual fact it is stuck in the very ditch of legalism and 
              futility (2:23).</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To state the 
              obvious, Paul does not repudiate practical morality and true piety 
              (3:5-10; 3:18-4:6). But he does, with all his apostolic zeal, repudiate 
              a confusion of such with the reality of Christ as alien righteousness. 
              This explains his avowed repudiation of piety in Colossians 2:16-23 
              and his exhortation to piety in Colossians 3:5-10 and 3:18 to 4:6. 
              The worldly deceivers (2:4, 8) thought that such piety, such self-mortifying 
              rigorism, is in actual fact that which pleases God, when all the 
              time it is Christ Himself, and Christ alone, who is pleasing to 
              the Father. The believer is pleasing because</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              he is in Christ and Christ is his life (2:9, 10; 3:3, 4). The seemingly 
              wise (2:23) were placing their confidence in and receiving their 
              encouragement from things on the earth, whereas Paul exhorts the 
              Colossians to look away to heaven because that is where Christ is! 
              (3:1, 2). The Colossian troublers were affixed to the <em>visible</em>, 
              whereas Paul calls those in Christ to realize that their acceptability 
              with God is a thing well and truly <em>hidden</em> (3:3). That righteousness 
              which is the sole righteousness pleasing in God's sight can only 
              be viewed by faith. Sight does not behold it until the time of the 
              end (3:4).<br>
              <br>
              Those caught away by the tradition of men (2:8) mistook their empirical 
              piety for newness, whereas Paul exhorts the Colossians to good works 
              on the basis of the fact that they have (already) put off the old 
              man and have (already) put on the new man (3:9, 10). Paul would 
              not have the Colossians tricked into thinking that the new man consists 
              in not lying, etc. (3:9). When observable piety is the expression 
              of faith in Christ as our alien righteousness, then such works are 
              the fruit of the Spirit. If not, irrespective of how wise and spiritual 
              and loving they appear, they are flesh.</font></font></p>

              <br>
              What, then, are some consequences of this New Testament message? 
              What should it teach the evangelical church of today about faith?</font> </p><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">1.</font></strong> Faith is always faith in the alien righteousness of Jesus Christ. 
                  This righteousness must never be confused with the new obedience 
                  of the believer, for the righteousness of faith is Jesus Christ 
                  Himself. He, Jesus Christ, is all in all. Faith in Jesus Christ 
                  as alien righteousness is the peculiar creation of the Spirit.<br>
              <br>
              Has not piety, or what we are accustomed to call &quot;sanctification,&quot; replaced the alien righteousness of Jesus Christ? That which ought 
                  to be the by productive fruit of gratitude for a new life in the 
                  person of Christ, has become that which we offer to God for our 
            acceptance in His sight.</font>            
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">2. </font></strong>Faith is never centered in conversion or the new birth. Conversion-mentality 
                  and not Christ-mentality characterizes so much preaching and teaching 
                  today. We need constantly to be on our guard against the tendency 
                  to substitute psychological and sociological newness for the New 
                  Man, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is hidden except to faith, and faith 
                  (<em>fides</em>) is opposed to sense (<em>sensus</em>) and sight. </font>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
              <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hence we need to exercise 
              great care in the use we make of the &quot;changed life.&quot; Empirical 
              piety may be ambiguous. It may not be empirically different whether 
              it comes from the Spirit or the flesh. The exchanged life of Christ 
              creates the changed life of the believer, but the changed life of 
              the believer must never occupy the place of the exchanged life of 
              Christ. The tendency to present our own righteousness to God in 
              the place of the one true righteousness of Christ, is the constant 
              leaning of the flesh.</font>

              <br>
              The Colossian message has much to say concerning the present-day 
              emphasis upon fullness &mdash; and visible fullness at that. Colossians 
              knows a fullness, and it may benefit us greatly to have a closer 
              look at it.</font>            
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="5"><strong>1. </strong></font>The fullness is in Jesus Christ (2:9), and by virtue of their 
                  faith-union with Christ, believers already possess that fullness 
            (2:10).</font>            
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="5"><strong>2. </strong></font>The fullness which the believer has in Jesus Christ is, of necessity, 
              hidden with Christ (3:3) and will not be manifested until Christ 
            is manifested (3:4).</font>            
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="5"><strong>3. </strong></font>This possession of fullness does not mean a cessation of the 
                battle against those things which seek to pull us away from the 
                Head. It is not always remembered that the positive statements concerning 
                the possession of fullness, riches, etc., were made of a group that 
                still needed to be told to mortify their earth-bound sensuality 
                (3:5), to stop lying to each other (3:9) and to persevere in prayer! 
                (4:2). Such richly-endowed believers were involved in the grind 
            of daily existence!</font>            
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="5"><strong>4. </strong></font>This possession of fullness in Christ does not eradicate the 
                hope of the believer (as does so much present-day fullness teaching) 
                but rather is the basis and guarantee of such a hope! (1:27). Because 
                he has put on the new man (3:9, 10), the believer does not expect 
                a here-and-now empirical completion but rather looks forward to, 
                and indeed presses forward to, a final fullness and newness which 
                will (then) mean the cessation of all further grind and battle!<br>
              <br>
              Finally, anyone who reads the epistle to the Colossians thoughtfully 
              must be struck by the silence concerning the Holy Spirit. Without 
              any intention whatsoever to deprecate the Third Person of the Blessed 
              Trinity, there may be a real corrective here to so much Spirit-centered 
              mentality. My own particular understanding here is that faith in 
              Christ as our fullness and righteousness before God, and the believer's 
              union with Christ, are but different ways of speaking of an important 
              facet of the Spirit's work. A comparison of Colossians 3:15-17 with 
              Ephesians 5:15-20 is quite instructive. The passages are very similar 
              indeed. Could &quot;Let the Holy Spirit fill you&quot; (Eph. 5:18, 
                        N.E.B.) and &quot;Let the message of Christ dwell among you in all 
                        its richness&quot; (Co!. 3:16, NEB.) be the same reality? Is not 
                        the tendency (!) of our day to interpret the Ephesian passage in 
                        such a way that gives more place to <em>sensus</em> than to <em>fides</em>? How would 
                        the Holy Spirit fill the Ephesian congregation if it were not with 
                        the message of Christ? Perhaps Colossians is an exposition of what 
                        Ephesians 5:18 ought to mean in the life of every congregation.<br>
