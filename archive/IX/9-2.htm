            Carnally-minded man can think of power only in the way it is seen 
            or felt through the senses. He forgets that all power is invisible, 
            and the most awesome power of all is word power. By a word armies 
            march; by a word men are exalted or debased; by a word the course 
            of a nation is changed. Words in the home result in emotional stress 
            that is felt in business, government and all of society, altering 
            the lives of millions. James did not overstate it when he said that 
            the tongue is a little member but boasteth great things.<br>
            <br>
            If a man's words have such power, how much more the Word of Christ? 
            He was the Word that was &quot;in the beginning with God. And all 
            things were made through Him.....&quot; (Jn. 1:1-3) God's power is 
            in His Word. &quot;By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and 
            all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.&quot; (Ps. 33:6) 
            In creation words expressed the will of God and caused that will to 
            be realized. He spake and it was done. The Hebrew letter says that 
            Christ is &quot;upholding all things by the word of His power.&quot; 
            (Heb. 1:3)<br>
            </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
            By words from His lips Jesus wrought His great works. To the sea He 
            said, &quot;Be still.&quot; To the palsied He said, &quot;Arise.&quot; 
            To a man dead four days He said, &quot;Lazarus, come forth.&quot; 
            And it was through His word that men heard that their sins were forgiven. 
            To the palsied man, &quot;Son, thy sins are forgiven.&quot; To a woman 
            caught in adultery, He said, &quot;Neither do I condemn thee, go and 
            sin no more.&quot; What possible experience could ever mean so much 
            as to know that the Lord had spoken words of forgiveness!<br>
            <br>
            When the Holy Spirit came with power to the apostles, it was exercised 
            by the words from their lips, that the gospel and the means of remission 
            of sins might be made known. &quot;Repent and be baptized every one 
            of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins.&quot; 
            The keys of the kingdom were these words, given by Christ to Peter, 
            to which three thousand responded that day and were &quot;added&quot; 
            to the church. When the apostle Paul came on the scene (he whose life 
            was full of experiences), he declared, &quot;The gospel . . . is the 
            power of God unto salvation.&quot; (Rom. 1:16) He preached not himself 
            and his experiences but the Word of God with reference to Christ's 
            death and resurrection, and the power was felt throughout the world.<br>
            <br>
            Power is not in our subjective experience. The power is in what God 
            has done through Jesus Christ, and this is effective for us when we 
            believe the Word of truth and appropriate it in faith. The power of 
            God is that power which He Himself has to cleanse us from sin through 
            Christ's death, and when He pronounces us clean, we are clean. That 
            pronouncement is made through Scripture, that which &quot;God . . 
            . hath spoken unto us in His Son.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Our generation is characterized by doubts and fears, by a frantic 
            search for meaning to life. Churches are changing their creeds to 
            make them acceptable to unbelievers. The testimony is not, &quot;God 
            says,&quot; but, &quot;I think.&quot; Where Paul said, &quot;I know,&quot; 
            his modern counterpart says, &quot;I feel.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Instead of looking to the record given by Christ, millions are lusting 
            after the excitement of a new experience. They want to find a richer 
            experience than faith in the gospel because they fail to see the glory 
            of the gospel, the fact that Christ has made us fit for Himself by 
            His death and resurrection. They are turning their eyes inward on 
            themselves, when the true object of our attention should be Christ 
            and His commandments. The sentiment prevails that those of us who 
            take refuge in the revealed Word are depending on the &quot;letter&quot; 
            of the law, where those who exult over experiences are living by the 
            &quot;Spirit.&quot; They fail to understand that evidence of the operation 
            of the Holy Spirit is not signs and feelings but the fruit of truth. 
            The experience Jesus demands of us is the experience of obeying His 
            Word.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

            Once, after Jesus had performed a great miracle, a woman burst forth 
            and exclaimed, &quot;Blessed is the womb that bare Thee and the paps 
            that gave Thee suck.&quot; Indeed, what an experience Mary had in 
            being the mother of Messiah. Could there be a greater experience? 
            Yes! Jesus said, &quot;Yes, rather blessed are they that hear the 
            Word of God and keep it.&quot; (Luke 11:28)<br>
            </font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Grace</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              The grace of God is not something that is generated within man or 
              produced by man's experiences but something which is wrought by 
              God through Jesus Christ, and that nearly 2,000 years ago on the 
              cross. It is known to us only through the Scriptures, specifically 
              in the doctrines concerning Christ's coming into the world as human 
              flesh, meeting the death penalty on the cross and rising from the 
              dead in order that believers might also be resurrected to live in 
              His presence forever. This grace is the same to all people, for 
              all time.<br>
              <br>
              Granted that to realize the forgiveness of sins and the hope of 
              immortality is a glorious continuing experience and to live under 
              Christ's commands is to experience many dramatic changes, afflictions 
              and victories; still it is none of this that gives power to save. 
              The experience which saves us is that which Christ experienced when 
              He died on our behalf and then rose from death to be our Mediator 
              and Sovereign King. We can never experience anything even close 
              to this. But we can believe it. I can believe that He died in my 
              place. I can repent and be baptized and know that my sins are forgiven 
              and know that I have assurance of eternal life.<br>
              <br>
              How do I know? Because He said so.<br>
              <br>
              Thus joy is not dependent upon experiences&mdash;these may sometimes be 
              joyful and sometimes tearful&mdash;but it is the product of believing 
              in Christ, the &quot;peace and joy in believing.&quot; (Rom. 15:13)<br>
              <br>
              Nothing that comes in the way of experience can remove this joy 
              and peace. It is given in power through the Word of God.</font></p>
