      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Editorial Note:</em> We believe that our readers will be interested in the following transcript of a forum on ecumenism which was recently conducted in Brisbane, Australia. The significant topic of church unity and the Reformation teaching of justification was discussed by a panel of speakers from the U.S.A., New Zealand and Australia. The panel consisted of the chairman, a teacher from New Zealand (Mr. John Slade), a doctor from the U.S.A. (Jack Zwemer), a Lutheran clergyman (Pastor H.P.V. Renner), and the editor and his brother (Robert and John Brinsmead), who are Australians.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Chairman:</strong> This evening the subject is that of church unity. Is the current church-unity movement compatible with the Reformation doctrine of justification by faith? In our forum tonight we have a guest speaker from the Lutheran Church, Pastor H. P. V. Renner. Pastor Renner, how do you regard the ecumenical movement?</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pastor Renner:</strong> As everyone knows, there is a very profound yearning for togetherness among Christians today. I believe that this is more than a sentimental desire to be in fellowship with each other. I think it is more than a contagion that has spread across the world &#8211; more than a reaction to the scandal and to the agony of dividedness. I think it is the fruit of an eagerness to see the will of the Lord done among us. I believe it is connected with a desperate endeavor to reach the end of the suffering and the frustration that sin and separation have caused in our world and in Christendom in particular. And I think, too, it is possible to see in this yearning for togetherness an anxiety about the survival of Christianity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the cry is for union among 
          churches. We note that even the word &quot;ecumenism,&quot; which denominations 
          once used quite proudly to describe the extent of their churches' world-wide 
          influence, has now come to mean a kind of movement toward interdenominational 
          union among churches which had hitherto been separate. The cry, &quot;In 
          Jesus Christ, we are all one; let us forget our differences and join in 
          a happy fellowship!&quot; has attracted quite a large and enthusiastic 
          chorus. But in this confluence of denominations, I think most of you know 
          that some of us Lutherans have been notoriously slow-footed and quite 
        cautious. And one might justifiably ask, &quot;Why?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not that we want to cling 
        jealously to our identity. You know that Luther hated the term &quot;Lutheran.&quot; 
        Neither do we necessarily want to preserve that identity. It is not that 
        we have forgotten the high-priestly prayer of our Lord either. And it 
        is not that we feel holier and more faithful to the truth than others. 
        It is rather that in this haste toward, and expression of, the oneness 
        in Christ Jesus, well-meaning people have not come seriously to terms 
        with the questions: &quot;What is the nature of this Jesus Christ in whom 
        oneness is to be found?&quot; and, &quot;What is the nature of the oneness 
        which Jesus Christ establishes?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sentiment and brotherly love 
        are essential ingredients belonging to the atmosphere of any confluence 
        of Christians, but we contend that they can never be the basis for union, 
        i.e., union in Jesus Christ. Neither can the basis be the highly subjective 
        experiences of those whose association with the faith is accompanied by 
        ecstasies, signs or speaking in tongues, or manifestations of sanctity 
        and piety in any form. The unity of the church, we believe, does not lie 
        in such phenomena, much of which is present anyway in non-Christian religions 
        and associations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The unity of the church lies 
        in Him who is its Head. It lies in the work of reconciliation by which 
        He gathered men out of their estrangement from God, out of the darkness 
        of sin and death, and, through the operations of His Holy Spirit, made 
        them sons of God &#8211; those who are justified by faith in Him. It is 
        amazing, and I believe quite distressing, with what facility people are 
        able to name the name of Jesus Christ and to confess allegiance to Him, 
        and at the same time remold and reshape His nature in their own reconstructed 
        ideas of Him so that His nature is disfigured into an acceptable and credible 
        form. Only the Jesus Christ of Biblical revelation can be the Head of 
        the church. A Jesus who is an example only, a heroic moral reformer, or 
        a wise pundit, or a man vested with divinity, or embodying in a symbolic 
        way the character of the Deity &#8211;a Jesus who is anything less than 
        the only name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved &#8211; 
        is not the Jesus of the sacred Scriptures. And any group of people giving 
        service to such an idea, such a construction which bears the name of Jesus 
        Christ, or to such a caricature of Him, cannot, we believe, be in communion 
        with those who know and confess Him as God incarnate, virgin born, human 
        and divine, crucified, bodily risen, King of Kings, destined to return 
        personally to judge the living and the dead. The two groups thus described 
        are reaching out to two entirely different directions; and though they 
        may even kneel side by side in a church, in a building, they are really 
        worlds apart.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Fundamentals 
        of Christian Faith</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Crucial in our search for the 
        one Lord in whom oneness is to be found, is a humble, earnest and worshipful 
        return to the sacred Scriptures in which this Lord is revealed to us. 
        And crucial also is an acknowledgment and an acceptance of everything 
        those sacred Scriptures make known about Him for our salvation.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p>At the heart of all that the sacred Scriptures make known about Jesus 
        Christ, is the truth that He is in word and in deed the God of our salvation, 
        who has made complete atonement for our sins, so that by faith in Him 
        we are declared just in the sight of God. Again let me stress that it 
        is a simple matter to give lip service to such a summary statement as, 
        &quot;He who by faith is righteous shall live,&quot; and to declare that 
        justification by faith is the basis of Christian unity. But if, as the 
        history of theology has shown, by justification is meant both acquittal 
        before the bar of a righteous God, and the infused grace of sanctification 
        or the bestowal of the charismatic gifts of the Spirit, we know that there 
        is an essential rift with those who hold that justification is nothing 
        more, nothing less than the declaration of God that man is righteous in 
        spite of his continuing state of sinfulness (in spite of his charismatic 
        impoverishment, if that is what some people emphasize). Again, if by faith 
        is meant the capacity in natural man to accept what God offers in Christ 
        Jesus, we know that there is an essential rift with those who hold that 
        faith cannot be a human capacity. So entire is man's fall into sin that 
        faith itself must be a gift of God. </p>
      <p>Under the same caption, &quot;Justification by Faith,&quot; diametrically 
        opposed theologies can be accommodated. It is quite possible to have togetherness 
        in such circumstances, but it is not possible, we contend, to have oneness 
        in Jesus Christ in such circumstances. Either we would say, &quot;Christ 
        alone is our salvation (as we sing in the hymn), and we contribute nothing 
        to our salvation&quot;; or, &quot;Christ is not alone our salvation, and 
        we have a part to contribute.&quot; To confess Him as Saviour and Lord, 
        in our opinion, does not mean both points of view. To accommodate both 
        points of view is to divide the house against itself, in which state the 
        best that can be hoped for is not church union, but a kind of agglomerate 
        separateness.</p>
      <p>What is desperately needed for true church union is the return to the 
        sacred Scriptures themselves, where 'the gospel, that great basis for 
        union, is presented to us faithfully by the Holy Spirit through His chosen 
        servants. True unity will come when we allow the gospel to call us, with 
        unimpeded clarity, out of our alienation from God, across the barrier 
        of sin, into an unconditional faith in Jesus Christ. When we allow that 
        to happen, I believe we will understand what true union really is. Only 
        the unadulterated gospel of God in all its theological depth and all its 
        simplicity (and not human negotiations, let alone human circumlocutions, 
        amendments, compromises and appendages to this gospel) can gather divided 
        man into God's communion of saints.</p>
      <p><strong>The Chairman: </strong>Thank you very much, Pastor Renner. We 
        are deeply appreciative of those stimulating remarks. Friends, dialogue 
        with Rome seems to be the fashion today. I have a news item here from 
        <em>Christianity Today </em>of December 3, 1971, page 45, under the heading, 
        &quot;Pentecostals to Rome&quot;</p>
      </font> <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Pentecostal 
          theologians &#8211; in Rome &#8211; for official dialogue with Catholics? 
          Yes, this month. A team, representing the classical as well as neo-Pentecostal 
          ends of the movement, will meet there, according to an announcement 
          made at the annual meeting of the Society for Pentecostal Studies, which 
          convened in Des Moines following the Pentecostal Fellowship of North 
          America. &quot;Killian McDonald, Catholic theologian and Benedictine 
          monk, broke the news to the thirty-five members present. &#8217;This 
          has greater meaning for the Secretariat in Rome than dialogue with Lutherans, 
          Presbyterians, or Methodists,' he urged. &#8217;And it would be embarrassing 
          and narrow, to say the least, if you Pentecostals should remain silent 
          waiting for Rome to announce this historic event.'&quot; But Pentecostals, 
          especially their educators and theologians, have come a long way since 
          the days when the pope was attacked as anti-Christ in Luther-style. 
          No negative ripple followed. . . &quot; </font></p>

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p>Religious boundary lines are becoming obsolete. Denominational groupings 
        are becoming irrelevant. The Bible says: &quot;We have also a more sure 
        word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed.&quot; 2 Peter 
        1:19. What light does prophecy throw on the question of union with Rome? 
        John Brinsmead, would you answer this question for us?</p>
      <p><strong>John Brinsmead:</strong> If charity would cause us to forget 
        or set aside what is written in Revelation 17, we are blinded by false 
        charity. The prophecy of Revelation 17 presents a description of a certain 
        church. It is so plain that he who runs may read it.</p>
      <p>In prophetic symbolism, a woman represents a church (Jer. 6:2; 2 Cor. 
        11:2). </p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have likened the 
          daughter of Zion To a lovely and delicate woman. NKJ Jeremiah 6:2</font></p>

        to name this wealthy, world-wide, persecuting &quot;mother&quot; who has 
        ruled the world from the famous seven-hilled city. The Reformers had no 
        difficulty identifying this great antichrist of Bible prophecy. God has 
        left this vital information on record so that we need not be in the dark 
        about the present church-unity movement. And as the book of Revelation 
        repeatedly says, &quot;He that hath an ear, let him hear.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Chairman:</strong> 
        Is the church-unity movement in Protestantism a sign of spiritual bankruptcy? 
        We will now hear from Dr. Jack Zwemer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dr. Zwemer:</strong> 
        I will state my thesis at the outset. It is this: The Protestant churches 
        are turning to Pentecostalism and toward union with Rome because their 
        alliance with secular and scientific humanism has failed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can explain this only if 
        we look back into history to the close of the Middle Ages. It marked the 
        end of a thousand years of human stagnation and corruption. The Dark Ages 
        were the inevitable fruition of a system wherein men tried to find fulfillment 
        through a mystical, spiritual experience.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the close of the Middle 
        Ages, two great movements arose. On the one hand, there was the Reformation, 
        which recovered that Pauline gospel which declares that human fulfillment 
        is found only in Jesus Christ. On the other hand, there was the Renaissance 
        &mdash;a movement to recover the ancient classical Greek ideal of fulfillment 
        in this life through the reason, the rational processes, the ingenuity 
        of men, through the effort of men, and through the exploitation by man 
        of the resources around him, both human and material. The Renaissance 
        was that great rebirth of classical learning which began in the fourteenth 
        century and made tremendous creative contributions to civilization &mdash; in 
        literature, the languages, the arts, in architecture, in medicine and 
        science.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Renaissance made a most 
        significant contribution to the Protestant Reformation. With the Renaissance 
        there came a breath of tolerance and a freedom of inquiry which could 
        only promote the study of the Holy Scriptures. The Renaissance contributed 
        outstanding Christian scholars like Wycliffe (earlier), Erasmus, and Melanchthon 
        (later). The Renaissance brought the recovery of the ancient Biblical 
        languages &#8211; Hebrew and Greek. It brought to the Reformers the original 
        text of Scripture in Greek and Hebrew. In the Guttenberg invention of 
        moveable type, it gave to the Reformation that engine for the distribution 
        of the Word of God. So it is understandable that the humanistic revolution 
        known as the Renaissance was most attractive to the Reformers and to those 
        who succeeded them. Indeed, it was not long before this Renaissance philosophy 
        was introduced into the very halls of learning in the Protestant universities. 
        History records that even Luther himself acquiesced to the request of 
        Melanchthon that the philosophy of Aristotle be taught at Wittenberg.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The contribution of the Renaissance 
        in human civilization has been very great. It brought an age of enlightenment 
        to the earth. It gave birth to the industrial revolution and the golden 
        age of biology and medicine, with all their benefits to men. And this 
        century has brought to us an unparalleled development in technology and 
        science, directly attributable to the thrust of the Renaissance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Protestant nations have 
        been the leading nations to foster the spirit of the Renaissance. I think 
        of my own native country, America, which in this century has witnessed 
        the outburst of the computer age, cybernetics, the atomic age and the 
        space age. It is an age that has come to fruition in this last decade. 
        It found its personal symbolism in the mystique of a young and dynamic 
        President, John F. Kennedy, who proclaimed a new frontier for mankind&mdash;that 
        man would not only explore this earth, but would explore outer space and 
        make his thrust to the moon. That hope has been fulfilled. Man has reached 
        the moon. He has explored the lunar crust, and he has found that it is 
        dead. Returning to earth, he finds that the mystique of the age is also 
        dead. All his triumphs are turning to ashes. He finds that his own earth 
        is defiled. His own cities are polluted. All human classes are alienated. 
        His very homes are divided, and his children debauched. And all that he 
        sought through the Renaissance (to unite men and to usher in the golden, 
        millennial age) has ended only in division of men.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the Renaissance itself is 
        dead. The disillusionment with secular and scientific idealism has created 
        a tremendous vacuum. Modern man has not found fulfillment in brilliant 
        human progress. The young and the old are dropping out. They are going 
        hippie, they are going Pentecostal, they are going into the Jesus Revolution. 
        Protestantism, which has been more enamored with the Renaissance than 
        with the Reformation, is greatly affected. Her alliance with humanism 
        has failed. She now seeks alliance with her old foe &#8211; the Roman 
        Catholic Church.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Chairman:</strong> 
        Where is Protestantism going to go from here? What is the road ahead? 
        Mr. Robert Brinsmead.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Robert Brinsmead:</strong> 
        Modern man does not really know too much about the real distinction between 
        Protestantism and Catholicism. The average Catholic and the average Protestant 
        have very little insight into the essential difference between the two 
        streams of thought. That a person calls himself a Protestant may not mean 
        very much today. A few years ago, one of the world's leading German theologians 
        took a chair among the theological faculty in one of the leading Protestant 
        universities in the United States. He observed that the real doctrinal 
        insights of the Reformers were unknown in that great Protestant institution. If 
        this state of things exists in the halls of learning what might be expected 
        among the common people?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a reason why Protestants 
        in general have little knowledge about the great insights of the Reformers. 
        Our age has been a very scientific and materialistic one; and the Protestant 
        churches have been affected by the spirit of the age. In fact, Protestant 
        societies have been the most progressive, the most scientific and the 
        most materialistic. In short, they have been most deeply affected by the 
        spirit of the Renaissance. Protestant youth have been educated by the 
        spirit of humanism far more than by the spirit of the Reformation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the last few years, there 
        have been some profound changes taking place. Until recently, the scientist 
        was like the high priest of society. But not any more. There has been 
        a real reaction against the illusion of scientific infallibility. Secular 
        and scientific progress has not brought man his much-sought-after fulfillment. 
        The most developed societies are the most affected by the feeling of emptiness 
        that failure to realize fulfillment. Take developments in the United States 
        as an example. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Young people from high-class 
        homes are turning to hippie-type movements. Some of the oldsters say with 
        disgust, &quot;They live in the wealthiest nation on earth, yet they are 
        not satisfied:' Those who criticize the hippies may sometimes be more 
        foolish than the hippies, for they think  that man can live by 
        bread alone &#8212; or automobiles, television and the affluence of suburban materialism.  
        Modern man has been drunk with the dream of secular and scientific idealism. 
        He has aspired to create an ideal environment and to find his fulfillment 
        in human progress. There has been a rude awakening. The most developed 
        societies are secular, foremost in discovering that man cannot find fulfillment 
        and satisfaction in materialistic achievement. In the wake of the great 
        disillusionment, there is a great spiritual vacuum. Multitudes are now 
        bent on finding satisfaction in a spiritual experience. Hence we are confronted 
        with the phenomena of neo-Pentecostalism and the Jesus Revolution. Those 
        involved in the Jesus Revolution are often young people who have unsuccessfully 
        tried to find fulfillment in the things of the flesh &#8211; in drugs 
        and in sex. They have not changed their aim. They have only changed their 
        method. Now they are desperately trying to find fulfillment and satisfaction 
        in Spiritual experience. This pronounced trend toward religious experientialism 
        is having a tremendous pact in the world. Neo-Pentecostalism is jumping 
        the denominational  barriers and making many of the old religious 
        groupings obsolete.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now the crucial point which 
        I wish to make is this: This great outburst of religious experientialism 
        (which is especially manifested in the neo-Pentecostal and Charismatic 
        Movements) which is directed toward finding satisfaction in a spiritual 
        experience is in harmony with the classical thought of the medieval church. 
        In short, this religious trend definitely belongs to the Roman Catholic 
        stream of thought. I will now direct my remarks to explain this central 
        thesis.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Christian versus Greek 
        Philosophy</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Greeks were the greatest 
        idealists the world has ever known. They were committed to the vision 
        of man finding fulfillment and satisfaction by means of his own self-development. 
        Although this ideal gave promise in the classical and golden age of Greece, 
        the failure of the Greek ideal was never more apparent than it was in 
        that morally and spiritually bankrupt civilization at the time Christ 
        was born.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Christian message turned 
        the Greek world upside down. In the first place, it declares that fallen, 
        sinful man cannot find fulfillment and satisfaction in his own experience. 
        But in the place of man's failure, it brings, in the gospel, a message 
        of faith and hope. Man does not have to seek satisfaction in his own work 
        or in his own experience. By faith he may find his satisfaction in God's 
        work in Jesus Christ and in the saving experience of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
        The Word of faith declares that our fulfillment is found in Jesus Christ, 
        the one perfect, ideal Man (Col. 2:10, N.E.B.). </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> and you are complete in 
          Him, who is the head of all principality and power. NKJ Colossians 2:10 
          </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christ is our righteousness, 
        Christ is our life, and all that He has done and all that He is in His 
        perfect humanity are ours by faith. The gospel brings also a message of 
        hope, for instead of expecting life to be fulfilled within the historical 
        process, the believer looks to the Parousia &#8211; the second appearing 
        of Christ when all that he now possesses only by faith will be realized 
        by visible reality.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet this great truth of righteousness 
        by faith was lost through the development of Romanism. The fathers of 
        the early church were educated in Greek philosophy. They tried to harmonize 
        the learning of Greece and the truth of the gospel. They took the Greek 
        ideal &#8211; human fulfillment and satisfaction and tried to achieve 
        it by the Christian means &#8211; grace. This &quot;marriage&quot; was 
        the foundation of the Catholic system. Men became absorbed in the pursuit 
        of finding satisfaction in a spiritual experience. Their own spiritual 
        experience became the primary object of their concern. To understand this 
        is to understand the heart of Roman Catholicism.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus the church lost the great 
        Pauline truth of justification by faith in God's work in Christ. It finally 
        sought justification by God's work in its own experience. Absorbed in 
        subjective experientialism, the church lost the hope of the Parousia &#8211; 
        the return of Christ. This preoccupation with trying to achieve fulfillment 
        through one's own spiritual experience, led to the stagnation of the Dark 
        Ages.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then came the Reformation, 
        which was a revival of the faith and hope of the New Testament. The Reformation 
        insight was embodied in its great doctrine of justification by faith. 
        Briefly, what did this doctrine mean to the Reformers?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because of their understanding 
        of &quot;original sin&quot; (the sinful nature of all men), the Reformers 
        clearly saw that life could not be fulfilled within the historical process. 
        They saw that, with or without grace, no man could find fulfillment and 
        satisfaction in his own experience. This discovery was the foundation 
        of the Reformation. In this context, their message of justification meant 
        this: Instead of looking inward to his experience, the believer looks 
        outward to Christ's experience for him; rather than looking inward to 
        his own work or even to God's work in him, the believer looks outward 
        to God's work in Jesus Christ. The righteousness which makes a believer 
        acceptable in the sight of God, said the Reformers, is not some quality 
        that God pours into the soul, but it is the personal righteousness of 
        Jesus, which remains inherent in Christ and resides only in heaven. With 
        this rebirth of the truth of justification by faith, there came a rebirth 
        of eschatological hope. Those who accepted the truth of the Reformation 
        looked forward in hope to the coming of Jesus, when life would be fulfilled 
        by visible reality.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just as Greek thought captured 
        the early church in the development of Romanism, so again Greek thought 
        captured the Reformation church in the development of the Renaissance. 
        As we have seen, the Renaissance was a revival of classical Greek thought. 
        It grew up alongside the Reformation. Its humanistic philosophy gave great 
        promise. Consider the brilliant achievements of the Renaissance &#8211; 
        the arts, sciences, discoveries, material advancement. It gave to the 
        world a dazzling display of human progress. Humanism promised man unlimited 
        progress, indeed human fulfillment and satisfaction through the unparalleled 
        development of human powers and earthly resources. </font></p>
      <p><strong><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Repentance Towards God and Faith Towards Our Lord Jesus Christ </font></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In contrast, what did 
            the Reformation offer man? </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;how I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house, &quot;testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, <strong>repentance toward God</strong> and <strong>faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. </strong>Acts 20:20-21 </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Sola fide</em> (solely by faith)! And poor 
            little <em>sola fide</em> seemed so unspectacular that the sons of the 
            Reformers became much more enamored with the spirit of the Renaissance 
            than with the spirit of <em>sola fide.</em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we have again reached the 
        great turning point in history. Men are realizing that the achievements 
        of humanism are not so brilliant after all. Protestantism stands at the 
        crossroads. Before her there are two alternatives.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Two Roads Ahead</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The popular trend right now 
        is to say, &quot;Human fulfillment cannot be found in the pursuit of secular, 
        scientific and materialistic values. Satisfaction for man can only be 
        found in spiritual values and through a spiritual experience.&quot; Among 
        the Protestants, Pentecostals and Charismatics are foremost in moving 
        in this direction. If Protestantism moves in this direction, then it will 
        be a return to the very principle of Roman Catholicism.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../LII/beastsofRev13.jpg" width="400" height="285" align="right">Is this possible? It is not 
        only possible, but a study of the thirteenth chapter of Revelation will 
        show that prophecy foretells this startling development. First of all, 
        this chapter brings to view a ten-horned beast which the Reformers had 
        no difficulty in recognizing as a description of the imperial Roman Empire 
        (see Daniel 7:7 &#8211; Rome is the frightful ten horned beast, the fourth 
        kingdom which follows after the Greek Empire). The prophecy of Revelation 
        13 tells us that this ten-horned beast would receive a &quot;deadly wound.&quot; 
        Rev. 13:3. The Reformers recognized this to be a prophecy of the fall 
        of the Roman Empire. But the Reformers further recognized that the prophecy 
        of Revelation 13 goes on to describe that this &quot;deadly wound&quot; 
        would be healed and once again the entire world would wonder after the 
        beast. All of the Protestant Reformers saw the &#8220;healing&#8221; of 
        the &#8220;deadly wound&#8221; as the rise of the Roman Papacy which arose 
        as a lamb-like beast from the ashes of the fallen Imperial Roman Empire. 
        The Papacy however soon ruled with an iron fist over the many nations 
        of Europe which formed after the fall of Rome. These papal nations were 
        called the &#8220;Holy Roman Empire&#8221; and they remain even unto the 
        present day as the modern states of Europe.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prophecy describes the 
        very thing which deceives those who worship the beast and whose names 
        are not written in the Lamb&#8217;s book of life. The terrible deception 
        which allows the pontiffs of papal Rome to rule over the kingdoms of this 
        world is that &#8211; &quot;He doeth great wonders, so that he maketh 
        fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth 
        them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had 
        power to do in the sight of the beast.&quot; Rev. 13:13-14. Thus, he &quot;causeth 
        the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose 
        deadly wound was healed.&quot; Verse 12.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This &quot;fire. . . from heaven,&quot; 
        which deceives men and leads them to yield their allegiance to Romanism 
        is undoubtedly a demonstration of spiritual power which appears to be 
        the baptism of the Holy Spirit. It appears to be heavenly fire as at Pentecost 
        (see Acts 2:2-3). Fire is a symbol of the Holy Spirit. It is significant 
        that the neo-Pentecostal development is often called &quot;fire from heaven&quot; 
        by those who experience it and advocate it to others. It is significant 
        also that this Pentecostal development is not only sweeping through the 
        Protestant bodies, but it is now being received with great favor by Roman 
        Catholics. In fact, leading Roman Catholic theologians and prelates are 
        endorsing Pentecostalism as a genuine religious experience which is in 
        harmony with the classical doctrine and experience of the medieval church.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fact is that the reconciliation 
        and union which the Protestant churches of today are seeking with the 
        Papacy could only take place because the Protestant world has lost that 
        great truth which shattered the papal power in the sixteenth century. 
        The truth of justification by faith alone inflicted a mortal blow upon 
        on the papal power (see the Introduction to the King James Version of 
        the Bible) but the Ecumenical Movement of today is seeking to once again 
        heal the rift which occurred in the Reformation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus does Bible prophecy show 
        us where the religious world is heading right now. Protestants and Catholics 
        are uniting in one desperate, final effort to establish a kingdom of God 
        on this earth &#8211; a scheme of human betterment which will promise 
        men their much-sought-for fulfillment and satisfaction.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But there is another alternative 
        before Protestants. The Bible indicates that a remnant will accept this 
        alternative. This will be a thorough-going revival of the truth of New 
        Testament Christianity and the great Reformation truth of justification 
        by faith alone. This will mean three things:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">1. </font></strong>A full and final abandonment 
        on the part of God's people of the hope of ever finding fulfillment and 
        satisfaction in their own experience in this life.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A re-affirmation that our 
        fulfillment and satisfaction are found alone in Jesus Christ. This means 
        that it is His experience, and not our own, that is of supreme importance 
        and is the object of our concern. It also means that God's people must 
        glory in what God has done in Christ and not in what God does in their 
        own little experience.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A confession that our hope 
        is in the personal and visible coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, who alone 
        can bring the lives of God's people to fulfillment. This means that the 
        Christian hope is not in any scheme of human betterment in this life. 
        It is not in a kingdom of God to be set up down here by men, neither is 
        it in grand religious alliances of human devisings. But the Christian's 
        hope is in the kingdom that God will establish &quot;without hands.&quot; 
        (see Dan. 2:45). When Christ comes and rolls up the scroll of time, then 
        it will be that God's people will actually possess by visible reality 
        what is now theirs only by faith.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, there are two alternatives 
        before Protestants today. Either they turn back to the Catholic system 
        of trying to find satisfaction in religious experience or they turn forward 
      to a hope in the return of Christ, who alone can fulfill history.</font></p>
