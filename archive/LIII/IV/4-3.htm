      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He arose and ascended 
        to heaven for us (Rom.4:25; John 14:2). He lives for us (Heb. 7:25). And 
        when He finally comes again, it is for us (John 14:3).</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He who intends to 
        build high must lay the foundation broad and deep. The plan of salvation 
        is founded on the infinite humiliation of the Son of God. He was the brightness 
        of God's glory (Heb. 1:3), yet was so humbled in the form of humanity 
        that He looked not like Himself, nor scarcely like a man (Ps. 22:6; Isa. 
        52:14; 53:3). His humiliation was real and voluntary before God and man. 
        It is not said that He was humbled, but that &quot;He humbled Himself.&quot; 
        Phil. 2:8. He came to this earth in the body of our humiliation and was 
        made &quot;under the law,&quot; yet He was &quot;God blessed for ever.&quot; 
        Rom. 9:5.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The eternal God was 
        born in time. The Creator became a creature. He who was equal to the Ancient 
        of Days became an infant of days. For the sun to fall from its sphere 
        and become a wandering atom, for an angel to be turned out of heaven to 
        be converted into a worm, would be no such great abasement; for they were 
        but creatures before, and so they would abide still, though inferior creatures. 
        The distance between the highest and lowest species of creatures is a 
        finite distance. But for the infinite Creator of all to become a creature 
        is a mystery exceeding all human understanding. The distance between God 
        and the highest angel is an infinite distance. Yet Christ became a man, 
        not an angel. He humbled Himself, and the world scorned Him (Isa. 53:2, 
        3). He was called Beelzebub, an illegitimate child or just &quot;the carpenter's 
        son.&quot; At His trial one could only refer to Him as &quot;this fellow.&quot; 
        (Matt. 26:61).</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For ye know 
        the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for 
        your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich.&quot; 
        2 Cor. 8:9. He came into this world, and there was no place to lay the 
        infant. He walked the earth, and there was no place to lay His head. He 
        died, and there was no place to lay the body. When He took our place, 
        He had nothing. As one has said, &quot;He went lower and lower until there 
        was no lower place to go.&quot; As Christians we may be humiliated, but 
        irrespective of how low we go, there is always a lower place. But not 
        so with this Man. The infinite God, who is all wisdom, could truly say, 
        I can search heaven and earth, but I cannot find a lower place to go.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Did man offend and 
        violate the law of God? Behold, God Himself became man to repair the breach 
        and to satisfy for the wrong done. The highest honor that ever the law 
        received was to have such a One as the man Christ Jesus stand before its 
        bar and make reparation to it. This is more honor and far more glory to 
        the law than if it had poured out all our blood and vindicated itself 
        upon the ruins of the whole creation. It is not so much to see the stars 
        overcast as to see the sun eclipsed. The greater Christ was, the greater 
        was His humiliation; and the greater His humiliation was, the more full 
        and complete was His satisfaction; and the more complete His satisfaction, 
        the more perfect and steady is our consolation. If He had not stooped 
        so low, our joy and comfort could not have been exalted so high. The 
        depth of the foundation is the strength of the superstructure, and &quot;ye 
        are God's building&quot; which is built upon that &quot;foundation&quot; 
        (1 Cor. 3:9-11).</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the light of the 
        cross, the heart can cry out &#8212;</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The condemnation was Thine, that the 
              justification might be mine &#8212; the agony was Thine, that the victory might 
              be mine &#8212; the pain was Thine, that the ease might be mine &#8212; the stripes 
              Thine, that the healing balm issuing from them might be mine &#8212; the vinegar 
              and gall Thine, that the honey and the sweet might be mine &#8212; the curse 
              was thine, that the blessing might be mine &#8212; the crown of thorns was Thine, 
              that the crown of glory might be mine &#8212; the death was Thine, that the life 
              purchased by it might be mine &#8212; Thou didst pay the price, that I might 
              enjoy the inheritance.&quot; </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And because of this, </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ye are complete 
                  in Him.&quot; Col. 2:10. </font> </p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though we cannot perfectly 
        and fully satisfy the claims and demands of God's holy Law, yet Christ's complete 
        obedience is imputed to us and stands us complete and without fault before 
        God. Oh, what a complete and perfect thing is the righteousness of God 
        in Christ! Let the searching eye of a holy and jealous God turn it every 
        way, view it from every side, and He will not find the least flaw or defect 
        in it. Let Him thoroughly weigh it and examine it, and it will ever appear 
        pure and perfect, containing in it all that is necessary for our atonement. 
        How pleasing, therefore, and acceptable to God must be that faith which 
        presents so complete and excellent an atonement to Him. Hence the acting 
        of faith upon Christ for righteousness, the approaches of faith to God 
        with such an acceptable offering, are the work with which He is well pleased  
        (John 6:23, 29). One such act of faith pleases Him more than if we should 
        toil all our lives at the task of obedience to fully satisfy all the demands 
        of the Law. It is more to God's honor and our comfort to pay all that 
        we owe Him in one payment, in one lump sum, than to be paying by very 
        small degrees and never be able to make full payment or see the debt cancelled. 
        By one such act of faith, God counts that all is paid and the debt is 
        cancelled.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because we are accustomed 
        in this world to time payment (buying a thing and paying it off by degrees), 
        in our Laodicean blindness we bring that system over into our spiritual 
        life. We think that by some keeping of the Law &#8211; and that poorly 
        done &#8211; and other services and reforms, we will satisfy the demands 
        of the Law. But it is all an abomination to God because it comes from 
        a wicked heart of unbelief, for the debt has already been paid and we 
        are free in Christ. We are inclined to cry out like that poor man in Matthew 
        18:26, &quot;Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.&quot; 
        But, like that man, we have no just conception of the greatness of our 
        debt or the greatness of our wretched poverty.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are not called 
        to Mount Sinai, to the covenant of works, but to Mount Zion, &quot;to 
        Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, 
        that speaketh better things than that of Abel&quot; (Heb. 12:18, 22-24). 
        It speaks not a debt to be paid, a life to be forfeited, but of a debt 
        already paid and a life already given.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is he that has 
        been forgiven much that loves much. If we examine the Scriptures, we will 
        see that in one sense there is no such thing with God as being forgiven 
        little or much. God either forgives all or nothing at all, and we either 
        pay all in one lump sum or nothing at all. For in this matter there are 
        no degrees with God. If Jesus sets us free, we are free indeed (John 8:36).</font></p>

          if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.&#8221; NKJ John 
          8:36</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The words of Paul 
        to Philemon are but an echo of the words of Jesus to His Father concerning 
        us: &quot;If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. 
        If he has wronged you, or owes you anything, put that on my account . 
        . . I will repay.&quot; Philemon 17-19.</font></p>

            cry, <em>&quot;It is finished!&quot;</em> and let us come to God by and in Jesus Christ. Then we will not only go away <em>free</em>, but <em>new</em> men and women in Him (2 Cor. 5:17). Now let our loving heavenly Father daily and always hear our heartfelt prayer made in the name of Jesus Christ, &quot;O Lord, be merciful to me a sinner, cover me with your robe of righteousness and wash away my sins and make me clean.&quot; </font></p>
