        <td valign=top> <FONT SIZE="6" FACE="Arial Black" COLOR="Maroon">The 
          Ideal Government</FONT><BR> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
            ideal government must combine the principles of both <em>justice</em> and <em>mercy</em>. 
            </font>          
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Justice </em>means equity, impartiality and the unerring application of 
              an inexorable law. But who could endure a stern <em>justice</em> where there 
              was no hope of <em>mercy</em> for erring men? Everyone who is conscious of 
              his own failings will be compassionate toward the mistakes of others.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The exercise of justice 
              <em>and</em> mercy appear to be inimical. &quot;Justice&quot; means to treat 
            every man as he deserves. &quot;Mercy&quot; means to treat him better 
            than he deserves. The human mind requires both, but finds them impossible 
            to combine. The ideal government will extend absolute justice and 
            at the same time will not fail to show mercy. And any system of government 
            that fails to combine justice and mercy will one day fall by the weight 
            of its own corruption. This is why human history knows of no enduring 
            system of law and order.</font>          
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet the &quot;impossible&quot; has been achieved. Such an ideal system 
                of government has <em>already</em> been established. It will soon be set up 
                and, without question (as a great statesman once said), &quot;it shall 
                stand forever.&quot;</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amazingly, this ideal government 
            was not established by force of arms or by popular vote. It was established 
            by one lone Man who died on a cross. But you will ask, &quot;Why this 
            mysterious death? What did that have to do with establishing a perfect 
            government for all men?&quot; The explanation deserves the serious 
            consideration of every man who wants to see the rule of equity and 
            compassion in society and in the family of nations.<br>
          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              The Almighty God, as Creator, Ruler and Judge of all, has a government. 
            It rests on two great pillars: justice and mercy. </font>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;<em>Justice</em> and judgment 
              are the habitation of Thy throne: <em>mercy</em> and truth shall go before 
              Thy face.&quot; Ps. 89:14. </font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When some of His subjects 
            committed rebellion and treason, the Judge had a God-sized problem 
            on His hands. If He executed the rebels (which His righteous law demanded), 
            how could He satisfy His yearning desire to show mercy and forgiveness? On the other 
            hand, if He exercised compassion, how could He be true to His own 
            inexorable justice. Each principle was as strong as the other. God's 
            desire to show mercy was as strong as His desire to uphold justice. 
            How could He establish His government on the basis of eternal security 
            and be true to Himself?</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is what the cross 
            of Jesus Christ is all about. The Judge of all came to this planet 
            in the person of Jesus Christ. Though Lord of all, He became servant 
            of all. He left His throne because His love called Him that way. Though 
            innocent, He voluntarily stood in our place and assumed our guilt. 
            Justice demanded that sin be punished and the death penalty be executed. 
            This Son of the infinite God suffered as we deserve in order that 
            we may be treated as He deserves. Divine justice unsheathed its sword 
            against our Substitute. The suffering of Christ was incomprehensible. 
            Yet there was no relenting until justice was fully satisfied for the 
            sins of the whole world. Those who think that God is some easy-going, 
            indulgent benevolence should consider the cross and see that the Ruler 
            of the universe is clothed in terrible and impartial justice. </font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not only did justice have 
            to be fully satisfied at the cross, but mercy too. Here God's mercy 
            was seen to be as great and as strong as His justice. At the cross, 
            God provided absolution  and forgiveness for the race. &quot;If 
            One died for all,&quot; says St. Paul, &quot;then were all dead.&quot; 
            2 Cor. 5:14. That is to say, since Christ has died in every man's 
            place, He has paid the penalty for the sins of every man. It is the same as if every man had died and paid the penalty 
            for his own sins. The resurrection of Christ from the dead is God's 
            witness to us that, in Christ, 1.) God has taken away the sins of the world, 2.) that 
            we have been redeemed, 3.) that mercy higher than the heavens and deeper 
            than hell has been offered and extended to us for Jesus' sake. </font>          
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of Christ, the 
              ancient prophet declared, &quot;The government shall be upon His shoulder.&quot; 
              Isa. 9:6. This is because justice and mercy met in Jesus Christ and 
            &quot;kissed each other.&quot; Ps. 85:10. That is why God has appointed 
              Him to be Judge and Ruler of all. With Him and Him alone, there is 
              perfect justice <em>and</em> mercy. &quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful 
              and just to forgive us our sins.&quot; 1 John 1:9. Justice himself 
              embraces the repentant believer in Jesus as a righteous man. If we refuse His 
              mercy and continue to trample on His law, mercy herself will punish 
              us with &quot;everlasting destruction.&quot; 2 Thess. 1:9.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Christ thought God's 
            government was worth dying for, we think His kingdom is worth living 
            for. We cannot help establish it. That is already done! Neither can 
            we help to set it up, for that will be done when Christ comes again 
            in power and great glory. But we can extol  its virtues and the goodness 
            of Him who made it possible. And we do extend to you the King's invitation 
            to be part of His ideal society: &quot;Whosoever will, let him come!&quot; and &quot;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!!&quot;</font>
