                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bishop Ryle 
                delivered twenty papers on the subject of Scriptural Holiness 
                at the time when the holiness movement was gaining prominence 
                in America. The message of this great evangelical sage is well-balanced, 
                spiritual, practical, easy-to-read and, above all, soundly Biblical. 
                Although written in the last century, it seems he was writing 
                especially for our day. His words tend to convince the understanding 
                and arouse the conscience rather than tickle the ears and excite 
                the imagination. We here reproduce a vital portion of his papers 
                on Scriptural Holiness<em>.</em> The entire presentation was reprinted 
                in 1956 by James Clarke & Co., Carter Lane, London E.C.4, England, 
                under the title of <em>Holiness</em>. &mdash;Ed.</font><br>

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              <strong>(1)</strong> I ask, in the first place, whether it is wise 
              to speak of faith as the one thing needful, and the only thing required, 
              as many seem to do now-a-days in handling the doctrine of sanctification? 
              &#8211; Is it wise to proclaim in so bald, naked, and unqualified 
              a way as many do, that the holiness of converted people is by faith 
              only, and not at all by personal exertion? Is it according to the 
              proportion of God's Word? I doubt it. </font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That faith in Christ 
              is the root of all holiness &#8211; that the first step towards 
              a holy life is to believe on Christ &#8211; that until we believe 
              we have not a jot of holiness &#8211; that union with Christ by 
              faith is the secret of both beginning to be holy and continuing 
              holy &#8211; that the life that we live in the flesh we must live 
              by the faith of the Son of God &#8211; that faith purifies the heart 
              &#8211; that faith is the victory which overcomes the world &#8211; 
              that by faith the elders obtained a good report &#8211; all these 
              are truths which no well-instructed Christian will ever think of 
              denying. But surely the Scriptures teach us that in following holiness 
              the true Christian needs personal exertion and work as well as faith. 
              The very same Apostle who says in one place, &quot;The life that 
              I live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God,&quot; 
              says in another place, &quot;I fight &#8211; I run &#8211; I keep 
              under my body;&quot; and in other places, &quot;Let us cleanse ourselves 
              &#8211; let us labour, let us lay aside every weight.&quot; (Gal. 
              ii. 20; 1 Cor. ix. 26; 2 Cor. vii. 1; Heb. iv. 11; xii. 1.) Moreover, 
              the Scriptures nowhere teach us that faith sanctifies us in the 
              same sense, and in the same manner, that faith justifies us! Justifying 
              faith is a grace that &quot;worketh not,&quot; but simply trusts, 
              rests, and leans on Christ. (Rom. iv. 5.) Sanctifying faith is a 
              grace of which the very life is action: it &quot;worketh by love,&quot; 
              and, like a main-spring, moves the whole inward man. (Gal. v. 6) 
              After all, the precise phrase &quot;sanctified by faith&quot; is 
              only found once in the New Testament. The Lord Jesus said to Saul, 
              &quot;I send thee, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and 
              inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in 
              Me.&quot; Yet even there I agree with Alford, that &quot;by faith&quot; 
              belongs to the whole sentence, and must not be tied to the word 
              &quot;sanctified.&quot; The true sense is, &quot;that by faith in 
              Me they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them 
              that are sanctified.&quot; (Compare Acts xxvi. 18 with Acts xx. 
              32.) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As to the phrase &quot;holiness 
              by faith,&quot; I find it nowhere in the New Testament. Without 
              controversy, in the matter of our justification before God, faith 
              in Christ is the one thing needful. All that simply believe are 
              justified. Righteousness is imputed &quot;to him that worketh not 
              but believeth.&quot; (Rom. iv. 5.) It is thoroughly Scriptural and 
              right to say &quot;faith alone justifies.&quot; But it is not equally 
              Scriptural and right to say &quot;faith alone sanctifies.&quot; 
              The saying requires very large qualification. Let one fact suffice. 
              We are frequently told that a man is &quot;justified by faith without 
              the deeds of the law,&quot; by St. Paul. But not once are we told 
              that we are &quot;sanctified by faith without the deeds of the law.&quot; 
              On the contrary, we are expressly told by St. James that the faith 
              whereby we are <em>visibly</em> and <em>demonstratively </em>justified 
              before man, is a faith which &quot;if it hath not works is dead, 
              being alone.&#8221;<strong><sup>1 </sup></strong>(James ii. 17.) I may be told, in reply, that 
              no one of course means to disparage &quot;works&quot; as an essential 
              part of a holy life. It would be well, however, to make this more 
              plain than many seem to make it in these days.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(2)</strong> 
              I ask, in the second place, whether it is wise to make so little 
              as some appear to do, comparatively, of the many practical exhortations 
              to holiness in daily life which are to be found in the Sermon on 
              the Mount, and in the latter part of most of St. Paul's epistles? 
              Is it according to the proportion of God's Word? I doubt it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="10-7a.gif" alt="Jesus Teaches the Crowd" width=575 height=400 border="0" align="right">That a life of daily 
              self-consecration and daily communion with God should be aimed at 
              by everyone who professes to be a believer &#8211; that we should 
              strive to attain the habit of going to the Lord Jesus Christ with 
              everything we find a burden, whether great or small, and casting 
              it upon Him &#8211; all this, I repeat, no well-taught child of 
              God will dream of disputing. But surely the New Testament teaches 
              us that we want something more than generalities about holy living, 
              which often prick no conscience and give no offence. The details 
              and particular ingredients, of which holiness is composed in daily 
              life, ought to be fully set forth and pressed on believers by all 
              who profess to handle the subject. True holiness does not consist 
              merely of believing and feeling, but of doing and bearing, and a 
              practical exhibition of active and passive grace. Our tongues, our 
              tempers, our natural passions and inclinations our conduct as parents 
              and children, masters and servants, husbands and wives, rulers and 
              subjects &#8211; our dress, our employment of time, our behavior 
              in business, our demeanor in sickness and health, in riches and 
              in poverty &#8211; all, all these are matters which are fully treated 
              by inspired writers. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They are not content 
              with a general statement of what we should believe and feel, and 
              how we are to have the roots of holiness planted in our hearts. 
              They dig down lower. They go into particulars. They specify minutely 
              what a holy man ought to do and be in his own family, and by his 
              own fireside, if he abides in Christ. I doubt whether this sort 
              of teaching is sufficiently attended to in the movement of the present 
              day. When people talk of having received &quot;such a blessing,&quot; 
              and of having found &quot;the higher life,&quot; after hearing some 
              earnest advocate of &quot;holiness by faith and self-consecration,&quot; 
              while their families and friends see no improvement and no increased 
              sanctity in their daily tempers and behavior, immense harm is done 
              to the cause of Christ. True holiness, we surely ought to remember, 
              does not consist merely of inward sensations and impressions. It 
              is much more than tears, and sighs, and bodily excitement, and a 
              quickened pulse, and a passionate feeling of attachment to our own 
              favorite preachers and our own religious party, and a readiness 
              to quarrel with everyone who does not agree with us. It is something 
              of &quot;the image of Christ,&quot; which can be seen and observed 
              by others in our private life, and habits, and character, and doings. 
              (Rom. viii. 29.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(3)</strong> 
              I ask, in the third place, whether it is wise to use vague language 
              about perfection, and to press on Christians a standard of holiness, 
              as attainable in this world for which there is no warrant to be 
              shown either in Scripture or experience? I doubt it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That believers are exhorted 
              to &quot;perfect holiness in the fear of God&quot; &#8211; to &quot;go 
              on to perfection&quot; &#8211; to &quot;be perfect,&quot; no careful 
              reader of his Bible will ever think of denying. (2 Cor. vii.1; Heb. 
              vi.1; 2 Cor. xiii.11.) But I have yet to learn that there is a single 
              passage in Scripture which teaches that a literal perfection, a 
              complete and entire freedom from sin, in thought, or word, or deed, 
              is attainable, or ever has been attained, by any child of Adam in 
              this world. A comparative perfection, a perfection in knowledge, 
              an all-round consistency in every relation of life, a thorough soundness 
              in every point of doctrine &#8211; this may be seen occasionally 
              in some of God's believing people. But as to an absolute literal 
              perfection, the most eminent saints of God in every age have always 
              been the very last to lay claim to it! On the contrary, they have 
              always had the deepest sense of their own utter unworthiness and 
              imperfection. The more spiritual light they have enjoyed the more 
              they have seen their own countless defects and shortcomings. The 
              more grace they have had the more they have been &quot;clothed with 
              humility.&quot; (1 Peter v. 5.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What saint can be named 
              in God's Word, of whose life many details are recorded, who was 
              literally and absolutely perfect? Which of them all, when writing 
              about himself, ever talks of feeling free from imperfection? On 
              the contrary, men like David, and St. Paul, and St. John, declare 
              in the strongest language that they feel in their own hearts weakness 
              and sin. The holiest men of modern times have always been remarkable 
              for deep humility. Have we ever seen holier men than the martyred 
              John Bradford, or Hooker, or Usher, or Baxter, or Rutherford, or 
              M'Cheyne? Yet no one can read the writings and letters of these 
              men without seeing that they felt themselves &quot;debtors to mercy 
              and grace&quot; every day, and the very last thing they ever laid 
              claim to was perfection!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In face of such facts 
              as these I must protest against the language used in many quarters, 
              in these last days, about perfection. I must think that those who 
              use it either know very little of the nature of sin, or of the attributes 
              of God, or of their own hearts, or of the Bible, or of the meaning 
              of words. When a professing Christian coolly tells me that he has 
              got beyond such hymns as &quot;Just as I am,&quot; and that they 
              are below his present experience, though they suited him when he 
              first took up religion, I must think his soul is in a very unhealthy 
              state! When a man can talk coolly of the possibility of &quot;living 
              without sin&quot; while in the body, and can actually say that he 
              has &quot;never had an evil thought for three months,&quot; I can 
              only say that in my opinion he is a very ignorant Christian! I protest 
              against such teaching as this. It not only does no good, but does 
              immense harm. It disgusts and alienates from religion far-seeing 
              men of the world, who know it is incorrect and untrue. It depresses 
              some of the best of God's children, who feel they never can attain 
              to &quot;perfection&quot; of this kind. It puffs up many weak brethren, 
              who fancy they are something when they are nothing. In short, it 
              is a dangerous delusion.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(4)</strong> 
              In the fourth place, is it wise to assert so positively and violently, 
              as many do, <em>that the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans</em> 
              does not describe the experience of the advanced saint, but the 
              experience of the unregenerate man, or of the weak and unestablished 
              believer? I doubt it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I admit fully that the 
              point has been a disputed one for eighteen centuries, in fact ever 
              since the days of St. Paul. I admit fully that eminent Christians 
              like John and Charles Wesley, and Fletcher, a hundred years ago, 
              to say nothing of some able writers of our own timer, maintain firmly 
              that St. Paul was not describing his own present experience when 
              he wrote this seventh chapter. I admit fully that many cannot see 
              what I and many others do see: viz., that Paul says nothing in this 
              chapter which does not precisely tally with the recorded experience 
              of the most eminent saints in every age, and that he does say several 
              things which no unregenerate man or weak believer would ever think 
              of saying, and cannot say. So, at any rate, it appears to me. But 
              I will not enter into any detailed discussion of the chapter. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup></font><br>
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              What I do lay stress upon is the broad fact that the best commentators 
              in every era of the Church have almost invariably applied the seventh 
              chapter of Romans to advanced believers. The commentators who do 
              not take this view have been, with a few bright exceptions, the 
              Romanists, the Socinians, and the Arminians. Against them is arrayed 
              the judgment of almost all the Reformers, almost all the Puritans, 
              and the best modern Evangelical divines. I shall be told, of course, 
              that no man is infallible, that the Reformers, Puritans, and modern 
              divines I refer to may have been entirely mistaken, and the Romanists, 
              Socinians, and Arminians may have been quite right! Our Lord has 
              taught us, no doubt, to &quot;call no man master.&#8221; But while 
              I ask no man to call the Reformers and Puritans &quot;masters,&quot; 
              I do ask people to read what they say on this subject, and answer 
              their arguments, if they can. This has not been done yet! To say, 
              as some do, that they do not want human &quot;dogmas&quot; and &quot;doctrines,&quot; 
              is no reply at all. The whole point at issue is, &quot;What is the 
              meaning of a passage of Scripture? How is the Seventh chapter of 
              the Epistle to the Romans to be interpreted? What is the true sense 
              of its words?&quot; At any rate let us remember that there is a 
              great fact which cannot be got over. On one side stand the opinions 
              and interpretations of Reformers and Puritans, and on the other 
              the opinions and interpretations of Romanists, Socinians, and Arminians. 
            Let that be distinctly understood.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the face of such a 
              fact as this I must enter my protest against the sneering, taunting, 
              contemptuous language which has been frequently used of late by 
              some of the advocates of what I must call the Arminian view of the 
              Seventh of Romans, in speaking of the opinions of their opponents. 
              To say the least, such language is unseemly, and only defeats its 
              own end. A cause which is defended by such language is deservedly 
              suspicious. Truth needs no such weapons. If we cannot agree with 
              men, we need not speak of their views with discourtesy and contempt. 
              An opinion which is backed and supported by such men as the best 
              Reformers and Puritans may not carry conviction to all minds in 
              the nineteenth century, but at any rate it would be well to speak 
              of it with respect.</font></p>

              In the fifth place, is it wise to use the language which is often 
              used in the present day about the doctrine of &quot;<em>Christ in 
              us</em>&quot;? I doubt it. Is not this doctrine often exalted to 
              a position which it does not occupy in Scripture? I am afraid that 
              it is.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That the true believer is one with Christ and Christ in him, no 
                careful reader of the New Testament will think of denying for a 
                moment. There is, no doubt, a mystical union between Christ and 
                the believer. With Him we died, with Him we were buried, with Him 
                we rose again, with Him we sit in heavenly places. We have five 
                plain texts where we are distinctly taught that Christ is &quot;in 
                us.&quot; (Rom. viii. 10; Gal. ii. 20; iv. 19; Eph. iii. 17; Col. 
                iii. 11.) But we must be careful that we understand what we mean 
                by the expression. That &quot;Christ dwells in our hearts by faith,&quot; 
              and carries on His inward work by His Spirit, is clear and plain. 
              But if we mean to say that beside, and over, and above this there 
              is some mysterious indwelling of Christ in a believer, we must be 
              careful what we are about. Unless we take care, we shall find ourselves 
              ignoring the work of the Holy Ghost. We shall be forgetting that 
              in the Divine economy of man's salvation election is the special 
              work of God the Father &#8211; atonement, mediation, and intercession, 
                the special work of God the Son &#8211; and sanctification, the 
                special work of God the Holy Ghost. We shall be forgetting that 
                our Lord said, when He went away, that He would send us another 
                Comforter, who should &quot;abide with us&quot; for ever, and, as 
                it were, take His place. (John xiv. 16.) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In short, under the idea 
              that we are honoring Christ, we shall find that we are dishonoring 
              His special and peculiar gift &#8211; the Holy Ghost. Christ, no 
              doubt, as God, is everywhere &#8211; in our hearts, in heaven, in 
              the place where two or three are met together in His name. But we 
              really must remember that Christ, as our risen Head and High Priest, 
              is <em>specially</em> at God's right hand interceding for us until 
              He comes the second time; and that Christ carries on His work in 
              the hearts of His people by the special work of His Spirit, whom 
              He promised to send when He left the world. (John xv. 26.) A comparison 
              of the ninth and tenth verses of the eighth chapter of Romans seems 
              to me to show this plainly. It convinces me that &quot;Christ in 
              us&quot; means Christ in us &quot;by His Spirit.&quot; Above all, 
              the words of St. John are most distinct and express: &quot;Hereby 
              we know that He abideth in us by the Spirit which He hath given 
              us.&quot; (1 John iii. 24.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In saying all this, I 
              hope no one will misunderstand me. I do not say that the expression 
              &quot;Christ in us&quot; is unscriptural. But I do say that I see 
              great danger of giving an extravagant and unscriptural importance 
              to the idea contained in the expression; and I fear that many use 
              it now-a-days without exactly knowing what they mean, and unwittingly, 
              perhaps, dishonour the mighty work of the Holy Ghost. If any readers 
              think that I am needlessly scrupulous about the point, I recommend 
              to their notice a curious book by Samuel Rutherford (author of the 
              well-known letters), called &quot;<em>The Spiritual Antichrist.</em>&quot; 
              They will there see that two centuries ago the wildest heresies 
              arose out of an extravagant teaching of this very doctrine of the 
              &quot;indwelling of Christ&quot; in believers. They will find that 
              Saltmarsh, and Dell, and Towne, and other false teachers, against 
              whom good Samuel Rutherford contended, began with strange notions 
              of &quot;Christ in us,&quot; and then proceeded to build on the 
              doctrine antinomianism, and fanaticism of the worst description 
              and vilest tendency. They maintained that the separate, personal 
              life of the believer was so completely gone, that it was <em>Christ 
              living in him</em> who repented, and believed, and acted! The root 
              of this huge error was a forced and unscriptural interpretation 
              of such texts as &quot;I live: yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.&quot; 
              (Gal. ii. 20.) And the natural result of it was that many of the 
              unhappy followers of this school came to the comfortable conclusion 
              that believers were not responsible, whatever they might do! Believers, 
              forsooth, were dead and buried; and only Christ lived in them, and<em> 
              undertook everything for them!</em> The ultimate consequence was, 
              that some thought they might sit still in a carnal security, their 
              personal accountableness being entirely gone, and might commit any 
              kind of sin without fear! Let us never forget that truth, distorted 
              and exaggerated, can become the mother of the most dangerous heresies. 
              When we speak of &quot;Christ being in us,&quot; let us take care 
              to explain what we mean. I fear some neglect this in the present 
              day.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(6) </strong>In 
              the sixth place, is it wise to draw such a deep, wide, and distinct 
              line of separation between conversion and <em>consecration</em>, 
              or the <em>higher life</em>, so called, as many do draw in the present 
              day? Is this according to the proportion of God's Word? I doubt 
              it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is, unquestionably, 
              nothing new in this teaching. It is well known that Romish writers 
              often maintain that the Church is divided into three classes &#8211; 
              sinners, penitents, and saints. The modern teachers of this day 
              who tell us that professing Christians are of three sorts &#8211; 
              the unconverted, the converted, and the partakers of the &quot;higher 
              life,&quot; of complete consecration &#8211; appear to me to occupy 
              very much the same ground! But whether the idea be old or new, Romish 
              or English, I am utterly unable to see that it has any warrant of 
              Scripture. The Word of God always speaks of two great divisions 
              of mankind, and two only. It speaks of the living and the dead in 
              sin &#8211; the believer and the unbeliever &#8211; the converted 
              and the unconverted &#8211; the travelers in the narrow way and 
              the travelers in the broad &#8211; the wise and the foolish &#8211; 
              the children of God and the children of the devil.<em> Within</em> 
              each of these two great classes there are, doubtless, various measures 
              of sin and of grace; but it is only the difference between the higher 
              and lower end of an inclined plane. <em>Between</em> these two great 
              classes there is an enormous gulf; they are as distinct as life 
              and death, light and darkness, heaven and hell. But of a division 
              into three classes the Word of God says nothing at all! I question 
              the wisdom of making newfangled divisions which the Bible has not 
              made, and I thoroughly dislike the notion of a second conversion.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That there is a vast 
              difference between one degree of grace and another &#8211; that 
              spiritual life admits of growth, and that believers should be continually 
              urged on every account to grow in grace &#8211; all this I fully 
              concede. But the theory of a sudden, mysterious transition of a 
              believer into a state of blessedness and <em>entire consecration</em>, 
              at one mighty bound, I cannot receive. It appears to me to be a 
              man-made invention; and I do not see a single plain text to prove 
              it in Scripture. Gradual growth in grace, growth in knowledge, growth 
              in faith, growth in love, growth in holiness, growth in humility, 
              growth in spiritual-mindedness &#8211; all this I see clearly taught 
              and urged in Scripture, and clearly exemplified in the lives of 
              many of God's saints. But sudden, instantaneous leaps from conversion 
              to <em>consecration</em> I fail to see in the Bible. I doubt, indeed, 
              whether we have any warrant for saying that a man can possibly be 
              <em>converted </em>without being <em>consecrated</em> to God! More 
              consecrated he doubtless can be, and will be as his grace increases; 
              but if he was not consecrated to God in the very day that he was 
              converted and born again, I do not know what conversion means. Are 
              not men in danger of undervaluing and underrating the immense blessedness 
              of conversion? Are they not, when they urge on believers the &quot;higher 
              life&quot; as a second conversion, underrating the length, and breadth, 
              and depth, and height, of that great first change which Scripture 
              calls the new birth, the new creation, the spiritual resurrection? 
              I may be mistaken. But I have sometimes thought, while reading the 
              strong language used by many about &quot;consecration,&quot; in 
              the last few years, that those who use it must have had previously 
              a singularly low and inadequate view of &quot;conversion,&quot; 
              if indeed they knew anything about conversion at all. In short, 
              I have almost suspected that when they were consecrated, they were 
              in reality converted for the first time!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I frankly confess I prefer 
              the old paths. I think it wiser and safer to press on all converted 
              people the possibility of continual <em>growth</em> in grace, and 
              the absolute necessity of going forward, increasing more and more, 
              and every year dedicating and consecrating themselves more, in spirit, 
              soul, and body, to Christ. By all means let us teach that there 
              is more holiness to be attained, and more of heaven to be enjoyed 
              upon earth than most believers now experience. But I decline to 
              tell any converted man that he needs a <em>second conversion</em>, 
              and that he may some day or other pass by one enormous step into 
              a state of <em>entire consecration</em>. I decline to teach it, 
              because I cannot see any warrant for such teaching in Scripture. 
              I decline to teach it, because I think the tendency of the doctrine 
              is thoroughly mischievous, depressing the humble-minded and meek, 
              and puffing up the shallow, the ignorant, and the self-conceited, 
              to a most dangerous extent.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(7)</strong> 
              In the seventh and last place, is it wise to teach believers that 
              they ought not to think so much of fighting and struggling against 
              sin, but ought rather to &quot;<em>yield themselves</em> to God,&quot; 
              and be passive in the hands of Christ? Is this according to the 
              proportion of God's Word? I doubt it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is a simple fact that 
              the expression &quot;<em>yield yourselves</em>&quot; is only to 
              be found in one place in the New Testament, as a duty urged upon 
              believers. That place is in the sixth chapter of Romans, and there 
              within six verses the expression occurs five times. (See Rom. vi. 
              13-19.) But even there the word will not bear the sense of &quot;placing 
              ourselves passively in the hands of another.&quot; Any Greek student 
              can tell us that the sense is rather that of actively &quot;presenting&quot; 
              ourselves for use, employment, and service. (See Rom. xxii 1.) The 
              expression therefore stands alone. But, on the other hand, it would 
              not be difficult to point out at least twenty-five or thirty distinct 
              passages in the Epistles where believers are plainly taught to use 
              active personal exertion, and are addressed as responsible for doing 
              energetically what Christ would have told them do, and are not told 
              &quot;yield themselves&quot; up as passive agents and sit still, 
              but to arise and work.. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="10-7b.gif" alt="Wrestle" width=430 height=431 border="0" align="right">A holy violence, a <strong>conflict, </strong>a warfare, a fight, a soldier's life, a wrestling, are spoken of 
              as characteristic of the true Christian. The account of &quot;the 
              armour of God&quot; in the sixth chapter of Ephesians, one might 
              think, settles the question. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8211; Again, it would 
              be easy to show that the doctrine of sanctification without personal 
              exertion, by simply &quot;yielding ourselves to God,&quot; is precisely 
              the doctrine of the antinomian fanatics in the seventeenth century 
              (to whom I have referred already, described in Rutherford's <em>Spiritual 
              Antichrist</em>), and that the tendency of it is evil in the extreme. 
              &#8211; Again, it would be easy to show that the doctrine is utterly 
              subversive of the whole teaching of such tried and approved books 
              as <em>Pilgrim's Progress</em>, and that if we receive it we cannot 
              do better than put Bunyan's old book in the fire! If Christian in 
              <em>Pilgrim's Progress</em> simply <em>yielded himself</em> to God, 
              and never fought, or struggled, or wrestled, I have read the famous 
              allegory in vain. But the plain truth is, that men will persist 
              in confounding two things that differ &#8211; that is, justification 
              and sanctification. In justification the word to be addressed to 
              man is believe &#8211; only believe; in sanctification the word 
              must be &quot;watch, pray, and fight.&quot; What God has divided 
              let us not mingle and confuse.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I leave the subject of 
              my introduction here, and hasten to a conclusion. I confess that 
              I lay down my pen with feelings of sorrow and anxiety. There is 
              much in the attitude of professing Christians in this day which 
              fills me with concern, and makes me full of fear for the future.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is an amazing ignorance 
              of Scripture among many, and a consequent want of established, solid 
              religion. In no other way can I account for the ease with which 
              people are, like children, &quot;tossed to and fro, and carried 
              about by every wind of doctrine.&quot; (Eph. iv. 14.) There is an 
              Athenian love of novelty abroad, and a morbid distaste for anything 
              old and regular, and in the beaten path of our forefathers. Thousands 
              will crowd to hear a new voice and a new doctrine, without considering 
              for a moment whether what they hear is true. &#8211; There is an 
              incessant craving after any teaching which is sensational, and exciting, 
              and rousing to the feelings. There is an unhealthy appetite for 
              a sort of spasmodic and hysterical Christianity. The religious life 
              of many is little better than spiritual dram-drinking and the &quot;meek 
              and quiet spirit&quot; which St. Peter commends is clean forgotten. 
              (1 Peter iii. 4.) Crowds, and crying, and hot rooms, and high-flown 
              singing, and an incessant rousing of the emotions, are the only 
              things which many care for. &#8211; Inability to distinguish differences 
              in doctrine is spreading far and wide, and so long as the preacher 
              is &quot;clever&quot; and &quot;earnest,&quot; hundreds seem to 
              think it must be all right, and call you dreadfully &quot;narrow 
              and uncharitable&quot; if you hint that he is unsound! ...</font></p>
            <P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Sanctification</strong></font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sanctification is that 
              inward spiritual work which the Lord Jesus Christ works in a man 
              by the Holy Ghost, when He calls him to be a true believer. He not 
              only washes him from his sins in His own blood, but He also <em>separates</em> 
              him from his natural love of sin and the world, puts a new principle 
              in his heart, and makes him practically godly in life. The instrument 
              by which the Spirit effects this work is generally the Word of God, 
              though He sometimes uses afflictions and providential visitations 
              &quot;without the Word.&quot; (1 Peter iii. 1.) The subject of this 
              work of Christ by His Spirit is called in Scripture a &quot;sanctified&quot; 
              man. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He who supposes that 
              Jesus Christ only lived and died and rose again in order to provide 
              justification and forgiveness of sins for His people, has yet much 
              to learn. Whether he knows it or not, he is dishonoring our blessed 
              Lord, and making Him only a half Saviour. The Lord Jesus has undertaken 
              everything that His people's souls require; not only to deliver 
              them from the guilt of their sins by His atoning death, but from 
              the <em>dominion</em> of their sins, by placing in their hearts 
              the Holy Spirit; not only to justify them, but also to sanctify 
              them. He is, thus, not only their &quot;righteousness,&quot; but 
              their &quot;sanctification.&quot; (1.Cor. i. 30.)...</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(1) </strong>Sanctification, 
              then, is the invariable <em>result of that vital union with Christ</em> 
              which true faith gives to a Christian. &#8211; &#8220;He that abideth 
              in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.&quot; (John 
              xv. 5.) The branch which bears no fruit is no living branch of the 
              vine. The union with Christ which produces no effect on heart and 
              life is a mere formal union, which is worthless before God....</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong>(2) </strong>Sanctification, 
              again, is the <em>outcome and inseparable consequence of regeneration.</em> 
              He that is born again and made a new creature, receives a new nature 
              and a new principle, and always lives a new life. A regeneration 
              which a man can have, and yet live carelessly in sin or worldliness, 
              is a regeneration invented by uninspired theologians, but never 
              mentioned in Scripture....</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(3) </strong>Sanctification, 
              again, is the only certain<em> evidence of that indwelling of the 
              Holy Spirit</em> which is essential to salvation. &quot;If any man 
              have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.&quot; (Rom. viii. 
              9.) The Spirit never lies dormant and idle within the soul: He always 
              makes His presence known by the fruit He causes to be borne in heart, 
              character, and life....</font></p>

              expressly written that they are &quot;elect through sanctification.&quot;&#8230;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(5) </strong>Sanctification,

              &quot;Every tree is known by his own fruit.&quot; (Luke vi. 44.) 
              A truly sanctified person may be so clothed with humility, that 
              he can see in himself nothing but infirmity and defects. Like Moses, 
              when he came down from the Mount, he may not be conscious that his 
              face shines. Like the righteous, in the mighty parable of the sheep 
              and the goats, he may not see that he has done anything worthy of 
              his Master's notice and commendation: &quot;When saw we Thee an 
              hungered, and fed Thee?&quot; (Matt. xxv. 37.) But whether he sees 
              it himself or not, others will always see in him a tone, and taste, 
              and character, and habit of life unlike that of other men. The very 
              idea of a man being &quot;sanctified,&quot; while no holiness can 
              be seen in his life, is flat nonsense and a misuse of words....</font></p>

              in view Bible reading, private prayer, regular attendance on public 
              worship, regular hearing of God's Word, and regular reception of 
              the Lord's Supper. I lay it down as a simple matter of fact, that 
              no one who is careless about such things must ever expect to make 
              much progress in sanctification....</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(9)</strong> 
              Sanctification, again, is <em>a thing which does not prevent a man 
              having a great deal of inward spiritual conflict.</em> By conflict 
              I mean a struggle within the heart between the old nature and the 
              new, the flesh and the spirit, which are to be found together in 
              every believer. (Gal. v. 17.) A deep sense of that struggle, and 
              a vast amount of mental discomfort from it, are no proof that a 
              man is not sanctified. Nay, rather, I believe they are healthy symptoms 
              of our condition, and prove that we are not dead, but alive. A true 
              Christian is one who has not only peace of conscience, but war within. 
              He may be known by his warfare as well as by his peace.... </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(10) </strong>Sanctification, 
              again, is <em>a thing which cannot justify a man, and yet it pleases 
              God. </em>This may seem wonderful, and yet it is true. The holiest 
              actions of the holiest saint that ever lived are all more or less 
              full of defects and imperfections. They are either wrong in their 
              motive or defective in their performance, and in themselves are 
              nothing better than &quot;splendid sins,&quot; deserving God's wrath 
              and condemnation. To suppose that such actions can stand the severity 
              of God's judgment, atone for sin, and merit heaven, is simply absurd. 
              &quot;By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified.&quot;&#8212;&quot;We 
              conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the 
              law.&quot; (Rom. iii. 20-28.) The only righteousness in which we 
              can appear before God is the righteousness of another &#8211; even 
              the perfect righteousness of our Substitute and Representative, 
              Jesus Christ the Lord. His work, and not our work, is our only title 
              to heaven. This is a truth which we should be ready to die to maintain. 
              &#8211; For all this, however, the Bible distinctly teaches that 
              the holy actions of a sanctified man, although imperfect, are pleasing 
              in the sight of God. &quot;With such sacrifices God is well pleased.&quot; 
              (Heb. xiii. 16.) &quot;Obey your parents, for this is well pleasing 
              to the Lord.&quot; (Col. iii. 20.) &quot;We do those things that 
              are pleasing in His sight.&quot; (1 John iii. 22.) Let this never 
              be forgotten, for it is a very comfortable doctrine. Just as a parent 
              is pleased with the efforts of his little child to please him, though 
              it be only by picking a daisy or walking across a room, so is our 
              Father in heaven pleased with the poor performances of His believing 
              children....</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(11)</strong> 
              Sanctification, again, is <em>a thing which will be found absolutely 
              necessary as a witness to our character in the great day of judgment.</em> 
              It will be utterly useless to plead that we believed in Christ, 
              unless our faith has had some sanctifying effect, and been seen 
              in our lives. Evidence, evidence, evidence, will be the one thing 
              wanted when the great white throne is set, when the books are opened, 
              when the graves give up their tenants, when the dead are arraigned 
              before the bar of God.... He that supposes works are of no importance, 
              because they cannot justify us, is a very ignorant Christian. Unless 
              he opens his eyes, he will find to his cost that if he comes to 
              the bar of God without some evidence of grace, he had better never 
              have been born.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(12) </strong>Sanctification, 
              in the last place, is <em>absolutely necessary, in order to train 
              and prepare us for heaven.</em> Most men hope to go to heaven when 
              they die; but few, it may be feared, take the trouble to consider 
              whether they would enjoy heaven if they got there. Heaven is essentially 
              a holy place; its inhabitants are all holy; its occupations are 
              all holy. To be really happy in heaven, it is clear and plain that 
              we must be somewhat trained and made ready for heaven while we are 
              on earth. The notion of a purgatory after death, which shall turn 
              sinners into saints, is a lying invention of man, and is nowhere 
              taught in the Bible. We must be saints before we die, if we are 
              to be saints afterwards in glory....</font></p>

              True sanctification then does not consist in <em>talk about religion....</em></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(2)</strong> 
              True sanctification does not consist in <em>temporary religious 
              feelings.</em> This again is a point about which a warning is greatly 
              needed. Mission services and revival meetings are attracting great 
              attention in every part of the land, and producing a great sensation.... 
              Many, it may be feared, appear moved and touched and roused under 
              the preaching of the Gospel, while in reality their hearts are not 
              changed at all. A kind of animal excitement from the contagion of 
              seeing others weeping, rejoicing, or affected, is the true account 
              of their case. Their wounds are only skin deep, and the peace they 
              profess to feel is skin deep also. Like the stony ground hearers, 
              they &quot;receive the Word with joy&quot; (Matt. xiii. 20); but 
              after a little they fall away, go back to the world, and are harder 
              and worse than before. Like Jonah's gourd, they come up suddenly 
              in a night and perish in a night.... I declare I know no state of 
              soul more dangerous than to imagine we are born again and sanctified 
              by the Holy Ghost, because we have picked up a few religious feelings.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(5)</strong>

              Genuine sanctification will show itself in <em>habitual respect 
              to God's law</em>, and habitual effort to live in obedience to it 
              as the rule of life. There is no greater mistake than to suppose 
              that a Christian has nothing to do with the law and the Ten Commandments, 
              because he cannot be justified by keeping them. The same Holy Ghost 
              who convinces the believer of sin by the law, and leads him to Christ 
              for justification, will always lead him to a spiritual use of the 
              law, as a friendly guide, in the pursuit of sanctification. Our 
              Lord Jesus Christ never made light of the Ten Commandments; on the 
              contrary, in His first public discourse, the Sermon on the Mount, 
              He expounded them, and showed the searching nature of their requirements. 
              St. Paul never made light of the law; on the contrary, he says, 
              &quot;The law is good, if a man use it lawfully.&quot;&mdash;&quot;I delight 
              in the law of God after the inward man.&quot; (1 Tim. i. 8; Rom. 
              vii. 22.) He that pretends to be a saint, while he sneers at the 
              Ten Commandments, and thinks nothing of lying, hypocrisy, swindling, 
              ill-temper, slander, drunkenness, and breach of the seventh commandment, 
              is under a fearful delusion. He will find it hard to prove that 
              he is a &#8220;saint&quot; in the last day!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(7)</strong> 
              Genuine sanctification will <em>show itself in an habitual endeavor 
              to do Christ's will</em>, and to live by His practical precepts. 
              These precepts are to be found scattered everywhere throughout the 
              four Gospels, and especially in the Sermon on the Mount. He that 
              supposes they were spoken without the intention of promoting holiness, 
              and that a Christian need not attend to them in his daily life, 
              is really little better than a lunatic, and at any rate is a grossly 
              ignorant person. To hear some men talk, and read some men's writings, 
              one might imagine that our blessed Lord, when He was on earth, never 
              taught anything but doctrine, and left practical duties to be taught 
              by others! The slightest knowledge of the four Gospels ought to 
              tell us that this is a complete mistake. What His disciples ought 
              to be and to do is continually brought forward in our Lord's teaching. 
              A truly sanctified man will never forget this. He serves a Master 
              who said, &quot;Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command 
              you.&quot; (John xv. 14.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(8)</strong> 
              Genuine sanctification will show itself in an <em>habitual desire 
              to live up to the standard which St. Paul sets before the Churches 
              in his writings</em>. That standard is to be found in the closing 
              chapters of nearly all his Epistles. The common idea of many persons 
              that St. Paul's writings are full of nothing but doctrinal statements 
              and controversial subjects &#8211; justification, election, predestination, 
              prophecy, and the like &#8211; is an entire delusion, and a melancholy 
              proof of the ignorance of Scripture which prevails in these latter 
              days. I defy anyone to read St. Paul's writings carefully without 
              finding in them a large quantity of plain, practical directions 
              about the Christian's duty in every relation of life, and about 
              our daily habits, temper, and behavior to one another. These directions 
              were written down by inspiration of God for the perpetual guidance 
              of professing Christians. He who does not attend to them may possibly 
              pass muster as a member of a church or a chapel, but he certainly 
              is not what the Bible calls a &quot;sanctified&quot; man.</font></p>

              towards one another.... People who are habitually giving way to 
              peevish and cross tempers in daily life, and are constantly sharp

              man who gets through life most comfortably is the <em>sanctified 
              </em>man. No doubt there are some true Christians who from ill-health, 
              or family trials, or other secret causes, enjoy little sensible 
              comfort, and go mourning all their days on the way to heaven. But 
              these are exceptional cases. As a general rule, in the long run 
              of life, it will be found true that &quot;sanctified&quot; people 
              are the <em>happiest people on earth</em>. They have solid comforts 
              which the world can neither give nor take away. &quot;The ways of

              The subject of sanctification is of such deep importance, and the 
              mistakes made about it so many and great, that I make no apology 
              for strongly recommending &quot;Owen on the Holy Spirit&quot; to 
              all who want to study more thoroughly the whole doctrine of sanctification.

              present day, and that many think fit to neglect and sneer at him 
              as a Puritan! Yet the great divine who in Commonwealth times was 
              Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, does not deserve to be treated in 
              this way. He had more learning and sound knowledge of Scripture 
              in his little finger than many who depreciate him have in their 
              whole bodies. I assert unhesitatingly that the man who wants to 
              study experimental theology will find no books equal to those of 
              Owen and some of his contemporaries, for complete, Scriptural, and

              is common unto persons and things, consisting of the peculiar dedication, 
              consecration, or separation of them unto he service of God, by His 
              own appointment, whereby they become holy. Thus the priests and 
              Levites of old, the ark, the altar, the tabernacle, and the temple, 
              were sanctified and made holy; and, indeed, in all holiness whatever, 
              there is a peculiar dedication and separation unto God. But in the 
              sense mentioned, this was solitary and alone. No more belonged unto 
              it but this sacred separation, nor was there any other effect of 
              this sanctification. But, secondly, there is another kind of sanctification 
              and holiness, wherein this separation to God is not the first thing 
              done or intended, but a consequence and effect thereof. This is 
              real and internal, by the communicating of a principle of holiness 
              unto our natures, attended with its exercise in acts and duties 
              of holy obedience unto God. This is that which we inquire after.&quot;&mdash;<em>John
