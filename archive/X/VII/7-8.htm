      <P><B><font size="4">Faith Fulfills the Whole Decalogue</font></B>
      <ul>
        <font size="2">"It is faith alone that achieves this that all sins are 
        remitted to us and that the whole Decalogue is fulfilled by faith, because 
        faith alone gives me Christ, who is the fulfillment and the end of the 
        law. What else does faith give? It imparts and brings with it the Holy 
        Spirit, from whom all good works flow."&mdash;<em>D. Martin Luthers Werke</em>, 
        Kuitische Gesamtausgabe (Weimar, 1883), Vol. XXXIX, Pt. I, p.482. </font> 
      </ul>
      <P><B><font size="4">Law Must Be Fulfilled &#8212; Gospel Shows How</font></B>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="2">"Now when a man has learned through the commandments to 
          recognize his helplessness and is distressed about how he might satisfy 
          the law&mdash;since the law must be fulfilled so that not a jot or tittle shall 
          be lost, otherwise man will be condemned without hope &mdash; then, being truly 
          humbled and reduced to nothing in his own eyes, he finds in himself nothing 
          whereby he may be justified and saved. Here the second part of Scripture 
          comes to our aid, namely, the promises of God which declare the glory 
          of God, saying . . . 'If you believe, you shall have all things; if you 
          do not believe, you shall lack all things . . .' God our Father has made 
          all things depend on faith so that whoever has faith will have everything, 
          and whoever does not have faith will have nothing . . ." &mdash;<em>Luther's 
          Works </em>(Philadelphia: Muhlenberg Press; St. Louis: Concordia Publishing 
          House, 1955), Vol. XXXI, pp.348, 349.</font>
