          </font>          <P><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>5. </strong></font><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The believer delights in the law of God (Rom. 7:22). (Notice that 
                James calls the law the "law of liberty" [James 1:25]). </font>          
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
          <P>Our particular point of interest is Paul's teaching on the place 
              of the law in the existence of the believer. It is often pointed out 
              that Paul says Christians are "not under the law, but under grace" 
              (Rom. 6:14). Some assume this means that Christians are free from 
              all obligation to keep the law. There are several reasons why this 
              interpretation cannot be accepted:
          <P><strong>1. </strong>This interpretation takes no notice (apparently) of the context 
              in which the statement of Paul comes:
          <P><strong>(a) </strong>Romans 6:15, from which the fourteenth verse is detached, repudiates 
              in the most emphatic manner any suggestion that grace gives license 
              to laxity of life. Grace delivers us from the dominion of sin and 
              therefore establishes and promotes the opposite of sin (for man is 
              not left in a vacuum), namely, righteousness. Deliverance from sin 
              means deliverance to righteousness. We have become "slaves" of righteousness 
              (Rom. 6:18, R.S.V.; cf. v. 22). Sin is the transgression of the law 
              (1 John 3:4). Righteousness, therefore, must be seen as conformity 
              to the law.
          <P><strong>(b)</strong> The wider context of chapter 6 makes it clear that Paul is here 
              concerned with deliverance from the practice of sin (vv. 1-23). Paul's 
              great affirmation is that grace has set us free from being bound to 
              transgress the law (i.e., sin), which is another way of saying, Grace 
              sets us free to keep the law (vv. 2, 7, 14, 22).
          <P><strong>(c) </strong>"Under the law," in this context, means "to live under the terms 
              or conditions of the law." Every person born into the world is under 
              obligation to keep God's law perfectly as the condition of life with 
              God. The Christian has met this requirement in Jesus Christ. As we 
              said previously, Christ has fulfilled the law on our behalf. As Christians, 
              we are not "under [the obligation to keep] the law" for our acceptance 
              with God. Christ has already done this for us, and we have received 
              it as a free gift (i.e., we are living "under [the conditions of] 
              grace"). It is a grave blunder to interpret Paul's "not under the 
              law" to mean that the Christian may now live lawlessly.
          <P><strong>2. </strong>Those who deprecate the law fail to notice the wider context of 
              Paul's thought:
          <P><strong>(a) </strong>If Paul thought of himself as released from obligation to the 
              law of God, how could he, as a believer, confess, " . . . I consent 
              unto the law that it is good . . ;,l delight in the law of God after 
              the inward man . . . Rom. 7:16, 22; cf. v.25. Paul pronounces himself 
              wretched (Rom. 7:24), not because he is obligated to keep the law, 
              but because he falls so far short of reaching its standard.
          <P><strong>(b) </strong>In Romans 13:8, 9, Paul cites five precepts of the Decalogue 
              as relevant to the behavior of the Christian. The emphasis falls upon 
              the fact that love fulfills rather than negates these precepts. The 
              law defines what love is in the rough and tumble of daily existence.
          <P><strong>(c) </strong>In 1 Cor. 9:21, Paul unequivocally states that he is under the 
              law in the sense of humble obedience. Paul, the Christian, asserts, 
            " . . . I am not in truth outside God's law, being under the law of 
              Christ" (N.E.B.). The implication here is that Paul's relation to 
              Christ places him inside God's law as one for whom the law has application.
          <P><strong>3. </strong>Those who see no application of the law of God for the believer, 
              fail to take with sufficient seriousness the clear testimony of other 
              parts of the New Testament (see John 14:15; 15:10; 1 John; 2:3-5; 
            3:21, 22, 24; 3:3-10 Rom. 3:31; Matt. 5:19).

              and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him

              1 John 3:21, 22, 24 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have 
              we confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, 
              because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing 
              in his sight...  
              And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in 
              him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which 
              he hath given us.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 John 3:3-10 And every 
              man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is 
              pure. Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin 
              is the transgression of the law. And ye know that he was manifested 
              to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in 
              him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known 
              him. Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness 
              is righteous, even as he is righteous. He that committeth sin is 
              of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this 
              purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the 
              works of the devil. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; 
              for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is 
              born of God. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children 
              of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither 
              he that loveth not his brother.<br>
              <br>

              yea, we establish the law.</font></p>

              shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is amazing that some 
            will still deprecate the law of God in the light of such clear teaching 
            as this. One of the common errors is the failure to give concrete 
            content to the fruits of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22-25). We tend to think 
            of these as removed from their practical expression in the trench-warfare 
            existence of the believer. We romanticize, we idealize, we sentimentalize, 
            and all the time fail to see these fruits with a concrete and practical 
            content! The content is spelled out in the ancient and ever-relevant 
            law of the Most High God.</font>
          <P><strong>4. </strong>Those who speak of no obligation to the law in the Christian life, 
            do not understand the nature of the gracious intervention of God in 
            the life of the converted. The Holy Spirit not only creates a hunger 
            and thirst after righteousness in the believer's heart (Matt. 5:6), 
            but He also fills the believer with "the fruits of righteousness" 
            (Phil. 1:11).</font> 
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Genuine 
            (nonselfish) work takes place only when the law is kept by those who 
            are already God's children. Hence, the keeping of the law is the mark 
            of gratitude from the glad son rather than the fearful servant.</font>
