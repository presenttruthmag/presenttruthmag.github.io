      <hr size=4 color="#E96F6F" width=100% align=left>      <font size="+2" face="Arial Black" color="Maroon">Law and Gospel in the Lutheran Confessions</font><br>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="7-4.gif" alt="Philip Melanchthon" width=210 height=182 border=0 align="left"></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John A. Slade </font><font size="2">&nbsp;</font>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are three great confessions of the Lutheran Reformation: the <em>Augsburg Confession</em>, the <em>Apology of the Augsburg Confessio</em>n and the <em>Formula of Concord. </em>Each gives a clear testimony to the righteousness which is of faith and the place of law and gospel in Christian doctrine.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <em>Augsburg Confession</em> is the first and greatest of all the confessions of the Reformation. It was drawn up by Philip Melanchthon and unanimously accepted by all the German evangelicals of the sixteenth century.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">"Article 
          IV: Of Justification</font></B></font>
        
    <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Also they teach that men cannot 
        be justified before God by their own strength, merits, or works, but are 
        freely justified for Christ's sake, through faith, when they believe that 
        they are received into favor, and that their sins are forgiven for Christ's 
        sake, who, by His death, has made satisfaction for our sins. This faith 
        God imputes for righteousness in His sight. Rom. 3 and 4."</font>
      </ul>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Reformers were already 
        being accused of antinomianism, so Article XX vigorously refutes the charge:</font>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Our teachers are falsely accused 
        of forbidding Good Works. For their published writings on the Ten Commandments, 
        and others of like import, bear witness that they have taught to good 
        purpose concerning all estates and duties of life, as to what estates 
        of life and what works in every calling be pleasing to God." </font>
      </ul>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his <em>Apology of the Augsburg 
        Confession</em>, Melanchthon carefully elaborates on the doctrine of justification 
        by faith alone and defends it against the papal adversaries. After citing 
        a great number of scriptures and evangelical arguments, he says:</font>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Therefore Christ was 
        given, that we may believe that for His sake we are justified. He plainly 
        denies justification to the Law. Hence, for Christ's sake we are accounted 
        righteous when we believe that God, for His sake, has been reconciled 
        to us...<br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        <p><font size="2">"Truly, it is amazing that the adversaries are in no 
          way moved by so many passages of Scripture, which clearly ascribe justification 
          to faith, and, indeed, deny it to works. Do they think that the same 
          is repeated so often for no purpose? Do they think that these words 
          fell inconsiderately from the Holy Ghost? But they have also devised 
          sophistry whereby they elude them. They say that these passages of Scripture, 
          (which speak of faith,) ought to be received as referring to a <em>fides 
          formata</em>, i.e., they do not ascribe justification to faith except 
          on account of love. Yea, they do not, in any way, ascribe justification 
          to faith, but only to love, because they dream that faith can coexist 
          with mortal sin. Whither does this tend, unless that they again abolish 
          the promise and return to the Law? If faith receive the remission of 
          sins on account of love, the remission of sins will always be uncertain, 
          because we never love as much as we ought; yea, we do not love unless 
          our hearts are firmly convinced that the remission of sins has been 
          granted us. Thus the adversaries, while they require in the remission 
          of sins and justification confidence in one's own love, altogether abolish 
          the Gospel concerning the free remission of sins; although, at the same 
          time, they neither render this love nor understand it, unless they believe 
          that the remission of sins is freely received."&mdash;<em>Book of Concord</em> 
          (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1957), pp. 40,41. </font></font>
      </ul>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, Melanchthon 
        is very sensitive to the charge of antinomianism, and reasons from Scripture 
        to show the relationship of regenerate men to the law of God:</font>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Here the adversaries 
        urge against us: If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments, 
        Matt. 19:17; likewise: The doers of the Law shall be justified, Rom. 2:13, 
        and many other like things concerning the Law and works. Before we reply 
        to this, we must first declare what we believe concerning love and the 
        fulfilling of the Law.<br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        <p><font size="2">"It is written in the prophet, Jer. 31:33: 'I will put 
          My Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.' And in 
          Rom. 3:31, Paul says: 'Do we, then, make void the Law through faith? 
          God forbid! Yea, we establish the Law.' And Christ says, Matt. 19:17: 
          'If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments,' Likewise, 1 Cor. 
          13:3: 'If I have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.' These and similar 
          sentences testify that the Law ought to be begun in us, and be kept 
          by us more and more [that we are to keep the Law when we have been justified 
          by faith, and thus increase more and more in the Spirit] . Moreover, 
          we speak not of ceremonies, but of that Law which gives commandment 
          concerning the movements of the heart, namely, the Decalog. Because, 
          indeed, faith brings the Holy Ghost, and produces in hearts a new life, 
          it is necessary that it should produce spiritual movements in hearts. 
          And what these movements are, the prophet, Jer. 31:33, shows, when he 
          says: 'I will put My Law into their inward parts, and write it in their 
          hearts.' "&mdash;<em>Ibid</em>., pp.41, 42. </font></font>
      </ul>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having said this, Melanchthon 
        goes on to show that in this life the believer is never wholly without 
        sin and is "far distant from the perfection of the Law" (Ibid., p. 46). 
        For this reason, he must continue to live by faith in the forgiving mercy 
        of God. He is never accounted righteous on the grounds of his new obedience.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <em>Formula of Concord</em> 
        refutes legalism by confessing:</font>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We believe, teach, and confess 
        that, although the contrition that precedes, and the good works that follow, 
        do not belong to the article of justification before God, yet one is not 
        to imagine a faith of such a kind as can exist and abide with, and alongside 
        of, a wicked intention to sin and to act against the conscience. But after 
        man has been justified by faith, then a true living faith worketh by love, 
        Gal. 5:6, 50 that thus good works always follow justifying faith, and 
        are surely found with it, if it be true and living; for it never is alone, 
        but always has with it love and hope."&mdash;<em>Ibid</em>., p.220.</font> 
      </ul>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In its "Thorough Declaration," 
        the <em>Formula of Concord</em> devotes a large section to explaining 
        the proper relationship of the law and the gospel. The proper distinction 
        between law and gospel is called "a special brilliant light." It also 
        declares:</font>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Therefore the two 
        doctrines belong together, and should also be urged by the side of each 
        other, but in a definite order and with a proper distinction; and the 
        Antinomians or assailants of the Law are justly condemned, who abolish 
        the preaching of the Law from the Church, and wish sins to be reproved, 
        and repentance and sorrow to be taught, not from the Law, but from the 
        Gospel. . .<br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        <p><font size="2">"These two doctrines, we believe and confess, should 
          ever and ever be diligently inculcated in the Church of God even to 
          the end of the world, although with the proper distinction of which 
          we have heard, in order that, through the preaching of the Law and its 
          threats in the ministry of the New Testament the hearts of impenitent 
          men may be terrified, and brought to a knowledge of their sins and to 
          repentance; but not in such a way that they lose heart and despair in 
          this process, but that (since the Law is a schoolmaster unto Christ 
          that we might be justified by faith, Gal. 3:24, and thus points and 
          leads us not from Christ, but to Christ, who is the end of the Law, 
          Rom. 10:4) they be comforted and strengthened again by the preaching 
          of the holy Gospel concerning Christ, our Lord, namely, that to those 
          who believe the Gospel, God forgives all their sins through Christ, 
          adopts them as children for His sake, and out of pure grace, without 
          any merit on their part, justifies and saves them, however, not in such 
          a way that they may abuse the grace of God, and sin hoping for grace, 
          as Paul, 2 Cor. 3:7 ff., thoroughly and forcibly shows the distinction 
          between the Law and the Gospel."<em>Ibid</em>., pp.260, 261. </font></font> 
      </ul>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under the heading, "Of the 
        Third Use of God's Law," the <em>Formula of Concord</em> then goes on 
        to discuss the place of the law in the life of a Christian:</font>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Since the Law of God 
        is useful, 1. not only to the end that external discipline and decency 
        are maintained by it against wild, disobedient men; 2. likewise, that 
        through it men are brought to a knowledge of their sins; 3. but also that, 
        when they have been born anew by the Spirit of God, converted to the Lord, 
        and thus the veil of Moses has been lifted from them, they live and walk 
        in the Law . . . <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <p><font size="2">". . . we unanimously believe, teach, and confess that 
          although the truly believing and truly converted to God and justified 
          Christians are liberated and made free from the curse of the Law, yet 
          they should daily exercise themselves in the Law of the Lord, as it 
          is written, Ps. 1:2; 119:1: 'Blessed is the man whose delight is in 
          the Law of the Lord, and in His Law doth he meditate day and night.' 
          For the Law is a mirror in which the will of God, and what pleases Him, 
          are exactly portrayed, and which should [therefore] be constantly held 
          up to the believers and be diligently urged upon them without ceasing.</font>
        <p><font size="2">"For although 'the Law is not made for a righteous man," 
          as the apostle testifies 1 Tim. 1:9, but for the unrighteous, yet this 
          is not to be understood in the bare meaning, that the justified are 
          to live without Law. For the Law of God has been written in their heart, 
          and also to the first man immediately after his creation a law was given 
          according to which he was to conduct himself. But the meaning of St. 
          Paul is that the Law cannot burden with its curse those who have been 
          reconciled to God through Christ; nor must it vex the regenerate with 
          its coercion, because they have pleasure in God's Law after the inner 
          man.</font>
        <p><font size="2">"For the Law says indeed that it is God's will and command 
          that we should walk in a new life, but it does not give the power and 
          ability to begin and do it; but the Holy Ghost, who is given and received, 
          not through the Law, but through the preaching of the Gospel, Gal. 3:14, 
          renews the heart. Thereafter the Holy Ghost employs the Law so as to 
          teach the regenerate from it, and to point out and show them in the 
          Ten Commandments what is the [good and] acceptable will of God, Rom. 
          12:2, in what 'good works God hath before ordained that they should 
          walk,' Eph. 2:10."<em>&mdash;Ibid.</em>, pp.261, 262.</font>
        <p><font size="2">"Accordingly, we reject and condemn as an error pernicious 
          and detrimental to Christian discipline, as also to true godliness, 
          the teaching that the Law, in the above-mentioned way and degree, should 
          not be urged upon Christians and the true believers, but only upon the 
          unbelieving, unchristians, and impenitent. "&mdash;<em>Ibid.</em>, pp.263, 
          264. </font></p>
