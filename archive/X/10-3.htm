            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the eighteenth century drew to a close, you and I might have entered a little Anglican church in Olney near London. Had we entered the vestry prior to the service, we would have heard the gray-haired preacher at prayer, and the words he would repeat time and again were, &quot;Lord, I am the least of all Thy saints. What amazing grace, that I should enter this church to preach the unsearchable riches in Christ!&quot; For John Newton vied with the apostle Paul as to his right of being the &quot;chief of sinners.&quot; Raising himself up, he would walk to his desk and there, on a piece of paper and written in shaky handwriting, he would read and repeat the words of the Old Testament, &quot;Thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee.&quot; As he would enter his pulpit and look down, there, pinned to the lectern, were these same words. He never sat to study or stood to preach except he was reminded that God had delivered him from bondage.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Come into his rectory on Monday morning, stand outside his living-room door, and listen to the conversation. A voice we have not heard is saying, &quot;God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform.&quot; &quot;Aye,&quot; replies the preacher, &quot;but all in grace.&quot; The voice is that of William Cowper, England's great poet who had come to a deeper knowledge of Jesus Christ as his Lord and Saviour as he listened spellbound to the preacher of Olney. Listen again and we hear another voice, described by those who knew it as that of the most thrilling orator in the British parliament. </font></p>            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Sir,&quot; he is saying, &quot;I 
            will give everything I have in Christ's cause that I might rid England 
            of the terrible blight which scars her through the slave trade.&quot; 
            The speaker is William Wilberforce, deeply influenced for Christ by 
            the man whom God had so wondrously delivered from slavery and, later, 
            from being captain of a slaving ship. 
            <p>Born in 1725 to a respectable sea captain and a nonconformist mother 
              with deep piety, John Newton was one of the most amazing characters 
              of the eighteenth century. His father had spent much of his early 
              youth in Spain at a Jesuit college; and although the school had 
              not implanted any of the Jesuit religious zeal in him, he entered 
              life with a determined stateliness that led to his being respected 
              among seamen. John's mother took it upon her to see that her son 
              was educated in the best sense. Dr. David Jennings, minister of 
              the Congregational church at Newstairs, Wapping, encouraged Mrs. 
              Newton in her ambition to prepare young John for the day when he 
              would go to Scotland's St. Andrews University to be educated for 
              the ministry. (Being a dissenter, he could not enter an English 
              university.) Mrs. Newton was not to see that day, for she died during 
              her son's seventh year and, in some ways, was saved many heartaches. 
              During his early years, however, John Newton was schooled by his 
              mother in the catechism, with the prayer that if we bring up a child 
              in the way of the Lord, when he is old he will not depart from it.</p>

            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            <p>Brought up in the denomination of Isaac Watts, young Newton recited 
              Watts' hymns by heart:</p>
            </font> <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Why 
                should I join with those in play<br>
                In whom I've no delight;<br>

                Who call ill names and fight?</font></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">I hate 
                to hear a wanton song,<br>
                Their words offend mine ears;<br>
                I should not dare defile my tongue<br>
                With language such as theirs.</font></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            <p>Little did the mother know that ere ten years were passed, her 
              son would curse and swear and sing a wanton song with a tongue that 
              was as vile as any on a ship at sea.</p>
            <p>Under the care of a stepmother, John Newton missed the love and 
              spiritual care he had previously known. His father at sea saw little 
              of his son. Two incidents stand out in those years. When twelve 
              years of age, John was thrown from a horse and narrowly escaped 
              death when he missed by inches the sharp stakes of a fence. Frightened 
              by the incident, John Newton resolved that God must surely have 
              given him another opportunity of life and therefore, by God's grace, 
              he must resolve to live cleanly. But too soon he forgot the happening. 
            </p>
            <p>The second incident occurred when he was fifteen years of age. 
              He had arranged a trip on a rowboat with some friends to look over 
              a warship. Arriving at the boat slip, he found that his friends, 
              weary of waiting for him, had set out. As he stood cursing them 
              from the shore, he suddenly saw the boat turn over and his friends 
              struggling for their lives. One did not survive. Death had again 
              been so close to him. Surely God had saved him for a purpose. What 
              that purpose was, however, John Newton did not care to know. Instead, 
              he forgot this occurrence also. It was these two incidents which 
              later helped force him to realize the danger of memory. And this 
              was why he made as his special text, &quot;Thou shalt remember that 
              thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed 
              thee.&quot;</p>
            <p><img src="10-3a.gif" alt="Enslaved2" width=190 height=266 border="0" align="left">Captain Newton decided he must do something with his son, who was 
              growing insolent, dreamy, and dull, and who resented deeply any 
              chastisement. So John Newton was sent to work in Spain as a merchant-businessman's 
              assistant. Unsettled and impatient, he lost his job. Captain Newton 
              then decided to take John aboard his own ship, but in this situation 
              father and son irritated each other and John again found himself 
              on land. It was now that the rot set in, for wandering the portside 
              one night, he found himself <strong>in the arms of some burly naval men</strong>              and was gang-pressed onto a ship. When the ship's captain realized 
              he was Captain Newton's son, he was granted privileges and raised 
              to the position of midshipman. But young Newton had been humiliated. 
              The one thing which still gave him some self-respect was the love 
              he had for Mary Catlett, daughter of the woman who had nursed his 
              mother at death. It was this love which made him jump ship when 
              he knew he would be sailing abroad, perhaps for four to six years. 
              Unfortunately, the press gangs caught him and he was delivered aboard 
              ship. Before the full crew, he was <strong>stripped and beaten with lashes.</strong>              He lost all rank and privileges, and was sent below deck to do the 
              meanest tasks. His heart grew bitter. From now until he was thirty 
              years of age and crippled by a stroke, John Newton sank to the lowest 
              of the lowest. One can only understand the hymn &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; 
              after reading about this part of his life. Putting aside all remembrances 
              of the catechism, the now-confirmed freethinker began to mock those 
              who thought on higher things.</p>
            <p><img src="10-3.gif" alt="Enslaved" width=500 height=400 border="0" align="right">Transferred from the Royal Navy to a merchant ship, he came under 
              the influence of a merchant named Clow who had a marriage arrangement 
              with a negro woman that treated Newton in a manner to which no white 
              man was ever subjected &#8211; so much so that Newton became the 
              <strong>slave of Clow's negro wife</strong>. When any white trader appeared, Newton 
              hid himself, ashamed to be seen in his tattered clothes and shameful 
              occupation as the slave of a Negro.</p>
            <p>Then one day in 1748, a ship, <em>The Greyhound</em>, called at 
              Clow's plantation, and the captain inquired after a John Newton, 
              son of an old sea-captain friend of his. With a feeling of great 
              relief, Newton found himself being taken aboard and, on March 1, 
              1748, setting sail. The voyage was not an immediate return home, 
              as the captain still had some trading to do, so John Newton spent 
              his days in drinking and revelry. But something happened on that 
              voyage home, for God had not forgotten Newton. On the shelves of 
              the captain's cabin was a copy of <em>Thomas Kempis' Thoughts</em>. 
              With time on his hands, Newton took down the book and began to read:</p>
            </font> <blockquote> 
              <blockquote> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Since life 
                  is of short and of uncertain continuance, it highly concerns 
                  you to look about you and take good heed how you employ it. 
                  O hardness of men's hearts! O the wretched stupidity that fixes 
                  their whole thoughts and cares upon the present&#8230;whereas 
                  in truth, every work and word, and thought, ought to be so ordered 
                  as if it were to be our last; and we instantly to die, and render 
                  an account of it.</font></p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            <p>The shock of the words made Newton slam the book closed. He saw 
              again his mother and heard again the words of Isaac Watts' hymns. 
              In anger he jumped up and swore that for a freethinker as he was, 
              he could not return to these things.</p>
            </font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few hours later 
              he was facing the crisis of a <strong>sea storm </strong>and listening to the crew 
              wailing that all was lost. In his diary Newton says, &quot;I went 
              to speak to the captain, and as I was turning from him I said, 'if 
              this will not do, the Lord have mercy on us,' my first cry for mercy 
              since my childhood.&quot; That was a crucial cry, for now he began 
              to think on deeper things. Could the God of mercy and grace, of 
              whom his mother had spoken, really show mercy to such a blasphemer 
              as John Newton? He was called to the helm, and for eleven hours 
              he steered the ship. Here he had time to think. Should the ship 
              sink, &quot;he was bound for another life, but he was poorly provided 
              for the voyage.&quot; From that moment the blasphemy stopped. John 
              Newton picked up the captain's Bible and read, &quot;if ye then, 
              being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how 
              much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them 
              that ask Him?&quot; God's convicting work had begun.</font></p>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            <center>
            </center>
            <strong>Washed ashore</strong> in Ireland, Newton vowed to re-examine the Christian 
            faith. Looking back on that day, he wrote, &quot;I stood in need of 
            an almighty Saviour, and such a One I found described in the New Testament.... 
            I was sincerely touched with a sense of undeserving mercy I had received 
            in being brought safely through so many dangers.&quot; 
            <p>God's mercy and grace were wider than he ever imagined, for Mary 
              Catlett had remained true to him and was waiting to give her hand 
              to him in marriage. However, Newton as yet was not finished with 
              the sea, nor was he as yet willing to grant mercy and grace (such 
              as God had granted him) to the African slaves. Offered captaincy 
              of the ship, <em>The Duke of Argyll</em>, he set out for sea as 
              an exchanger of liquor with white traders to woo slaves into the 
              holds of his ships, to make his money from souls who were but numbers 
              to him.</p>
            <p>Returning home, he was led to read the book, <em>The Life of Colonel 
              James Gardner,</em> written by Philip Doddridge. Gardner had been 
              killed in 1745 during the Jacobite rebellion. Newton saw his own 
              life closely paralleled by that of Gardner, who had been converted 
              by reading Isaac Watts' words:</p>
            </font> <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">The 
                world beheld the glorious change<br>
                And did Thine hand confess;<br>
                My tongue broke out in unknown strains<br>
                And sung surprising grace.</font></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            <p>Deeply influenced by the book, Newton began to think seriously 
              of his future, but again he returned to sea as captain of a new 
              slave ship, <em>The African</em>. A crisis came in November, 1754, 
              when at home on furlough he suffered a slight stroke. Indeed, &quot;God 
              moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform.&quot; It was 
              the end of Newton's days as a mariner. He was forced to take a job 
              as tide surveyor at Liverpool.</p>
            <p>From now on, Newton fell under the influence of the great Calvinistic-Methodist 
              preacher, George Whitefield. On his thirty-third birthday Newton 
              spent eleven hours in fasting and prayer, seeking God's will for 
              his future as a minister of the gospel. The outcome was that he 
              linked himself with the established church, eventually becoming 
              the Anglican parish minister of Olney. It is here, in the small 
              rectory, that to this day we can find the words above the mantelpiece, 
              &quot;Thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of 
              Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee.&quot; He knew what redemption 
              meant, for he had not only been in bondage but had led many others 
              into it. Well indeed could he repeat the words of the apostle Paul, 
              &quot;. . . [ I ] am less than the least of all saints.&quot; Because 
              of the great depths from which he had been raised, John Newton knew, 
              more than most of us, how great is the grace of God. It is little 
              wonder that he became known as the preacher of joy, the writer who 
              cries out:</p>
            </font> <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Should my 
                tongue refuse to sing,<br>
                Sure the very stones would speak . </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

            <p>This is the man who wrote &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot; He knew of 
              it from his own experience. His epitaph of his own choosing relates 
              that all was of God's grace. He died in 1807; and in the parish 
              church of Woolnoth can be seen on his grave:</p>
