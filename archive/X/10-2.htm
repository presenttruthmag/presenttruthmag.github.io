            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We are living in an age 
              of &quot;man, the fugitive.&quot; He is a fugitive from law. Almost, 
              if not every area of human existence today reflects man's tragic attempt 
              to escape from law.</font></font></p>
            <p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nature</font></font> </strong></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Man 
              is the escapee from law in the area of nature. Western thinking 
              has believed in the law of nature, or natural law. In fact, from 
              the time of the Renaissance onwards, natural law came to dominate 
              Western thinking in our universities. This, however, cannot be said 
              of our day and age. Things have changed.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those who advocate natural 
              law say that there is such a law in nature which man's enlightened 
              reason can discover. Such a natural law is that by which man and 
              nations must be ruled.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two voices 
              against this view which have appeared over the last hundred years 
              or so, and which have had a great influence upon the thinking of 
              many:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, <strong>Charles Darwin</strong>. 
              Darwin contended that the one constant factor in the universe is 
              inconstancy, or change. This being the case, it is impossible to 
              speak of any absolute law. The universe has evolved by means of 
              chance variations, and hence no law has any absoluteness. In the 
              light (sic!) of this hypothesis, to speak of law is to speak of 
              social customs and statistical averages. The socially accepted gives 
              us our laws. For readers who are interested in perusing a sociological 
              outworking of this thesis, there is Emile Durkheim's <em>The Rules 
              of Sociological Method</em>, especially his chapter, &quot;On the 
              Normality of Crime.&quot; It cannot be denied that, in essence, 
              evolution is hostile to the very idea of law. Commitment to evolution 
              is commitment to revolution. Law implies an unchanging order, a 
              final standard, and this is the very thing the Darwinian cannot 
              accept.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second voice is that 
              of <strong>Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.</strong>, associate justice of the Supreme 
              Court. Holmes instigated a legal revolution in his book, <em>The 
              Common Law </em>(1881). He attacked the doctrine of natural law 
              as legal nonsense. Here is a sample:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Life of 
                the law has not been logic: it has been experience. The felt necessities 
                of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intentions 
                of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which 
                judges share with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more 
                to do with the syllogism in determining the rules by which men 
                should be governed.... The substance of the law at any given time 
                pretty nearly corresponds, so far as it goes, with what is then 
                understood to be convenient, but its form and machinery, and the 
                degree to which it is able to work out desired results, depends 
                very much upon its past.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="10-2a.gif" alt="Nature" width=562 height=219 border="0" align="right"></font>Here Holmes declares 
              that <strong>natural law </strong>is as variable as the persons expounding it. Although 
              Holmes did not have any illusions about the alternative to natural 
              law (i.e., the experience of the people as embodied in the state), 
              he preferred such to the philosophy of natural law. Hence, the courts 
              must reflect the evolving experiences of society.</font></p>

            </font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              Although we do not agree with the position of Holmes, it must be 
              said that if evolution is true, then Holmes' conclusions are inescapable. 
              The anti-natural law school includes relativists, positivists, pragmatists, 
              Marxists, existentialists and others! For most of these thinkers, 
              the only real law is positive law, the law of the state. Positive, 
              or state, law repudiates the notion of any higher law which stands 
              over man and the state.</font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
              Christian Answer</strong></font></font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christianity repudiates 
              the old natural-law concepts even more strongly than did Darwin 
              and Holmes.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>First, </strong>Christianity 
              does<em> not </em>believe that nature has any power, mind, consciousness, 
              or will in and of itself. Nature is simply a collective noun, a 
              name for the sum total of the universe. Christianity which is Biblical 
              Christianity, has no use for any form of personification of nature 
              save as a literary device to convey some message. Hence, strictly 
              speaking, Christianity speaks not of the law of nature but the laws 
              over nature.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Second,</strong> 
              Christianity does<em> not</em> teach that nature is normative. That 
              is, nature is <em>not </em>the standard; a thing is not good because 
              it occurs in nature, because it is natural. This is the error of 
              the moral anarchists. The truth is not &quot;what is.&quot; Nature 
              is not the standard because nature &quot;suffers&quot; from the 
              fall of man into sin. Nature is <em>infected</em> by sin and death.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Third, </strong>Christianity 
              does <em>not </em>believe in the Darwinian demolition of any absolutes 
              which govern and control nature despite nature's infection by the 
              Fall. The Bible teaches that man is a creature that is more than 
              biology, and man's law is more than a phase of his social evolution 
              which changes as man changes. Man, the Bible teaches, is a creature 
              of God who is created in God's image with knowledge, righteousness, 
              holiness, and dominion (Gen. 1:27-28; Col. 3:.14; Eph. 4:24). </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So God created 
                man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male 
                and female He created them. Then God blessed them, and God said 
                to them, &quot;Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue 
                it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of 
                the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.&quot; 
                NKJ Genesis 1:27-28</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But above 
                all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection. 
                NKJ Colossians 3:14</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8230;and 
                that you put on the new man which was created according to God, 
                in true righteousness and holiness. NKJ Ephesians 4:24</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Man's reference point, 
              therefore, is not society but God. True, the law of man's being 
              is derived, but it is derived from God and not from society. The 
              ground of man's health is the law, the Most High God (Deut. 6:24; 
              16:20). Man must not be judged socially but religiously, not by 
              his fellow men but by God.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Fourth,</strong> 
              though we acknowledge much truth in what Holmes has said about the 
              traditionally received doctrine of natural law, nevertheless we 
              assert again that the Bible will have no pact with legal positivism, 
              which makes the judges of the courts into gods. There is a far cry 
              from the Platonic philosopher-kings, who are the totalitarian rulers 
              over mankind. God is God. God has established various law-spheres 
              over nature, laws governing physical reality. In all areas of our 
              life, we are governed by laws. Whether we eat, sleep, work, worship, 
              or play, we move in the sphere of the divine law. Nature did not 
              evolve the physiological laws which govern our sleep. Nature did 
              not give us the laws of nutrition and laws of digestion. These, 
              one and all, came from God when He created the universe. The answer 
              to <em>natural law</em> and to<em> legal positivism</em> is the 
              revelation of the <em>Word of God in the Bible.</em></font> 
            <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We conclude our remarks 
              with some general statements concerning the Christian view of law.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="10-2b.gif" alt="Riot" width=576 height=232 border="0" align="left"></font><strong>First,</strong><em> 
              we are living in an age which is most vocal about its <strong>contempt for 
              authority. </strong>However, it is not possible to be free of all authority.</em> 
              Those who decry authority are either hypocritical or ignorant. It 
              is not possible even to think without authority!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It may well be that God 
              is denied and that every other man is denied, but such denial is 
              the assertion of the positing of authority in the denying subject 
              himself, in the individual. The man who repudiates all other authority 
              becomes his own god. Such a one is hostile to all authority except 
              his own. The authority of any system of thought is the god of that 
              system. It may be, as mentioned above, the individual. It may be 
              the people (<em>vox populi</em>, <em>vox Dei</em>). It may be an 
              avant-garde intellectual elite. Whatever or whoever it is, it is 
              the god of that system.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bible places authority 
              in the  God who has expressed Himself in the Bible. God is 
              above and beyond man. The purpose of God's law and of His government 
              is to establish man in godly order and true liberty.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bible places authority 
              in this world <em>only</em> under God &#8211; husband <em>over</em> 
              wife <em>under</em> God; parents <em>over</em> their children <em>under 
              </em>God; the state <em>over</em> its citizens <em>under</em> God. 
              All human authority is limited by God's authority.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bible places great 
              emphasis, therefore, on law as the vehicle of authority. Every law 
              presupposes an authority, and every authority denotes a law of some 
              kind to express itself.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Second, </strong><em>we 
              are living in an age in which men are choosing chaos instead of 
              God. If we believe that the universe evolved out of chaos, then 
              chaos is the ultimate factor and force of the universe.</em> Chaos 
              is the absolutely lawless source of all things. Marx was delighted 
              with the publication of Darwin's <em>Origin of Species </em>because he saw 
              it as &quot;a basis in natural science for the class struggle in 
              history.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bible is clear in 
              its faith in creationism. God is Ultimate and not chaos. What is 
              not often remembered is that God's way of regeneration is not by 
              chaos (revolution) but by grace (regeneration), and grace establishes 
              the law (Rom. 3:31). </font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do we then 
                make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, 
                we establish the law. NKJ Romans 3:31</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The purpose of the law 
              is life (Rom. 7:10).</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the commandment, 
                which was to bring life, I found to bring death. NKJ Romans 7:10</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Man in Jesus Christ dies 
              to the law as an indictment but lives in Christ, not to despise 
              God's law, but now to abide by it through the grace of God. Grace 
              is the believer's life, and law is its condition.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The paradise of Eden 
              was not a lawless domain. Law prevailed absolutely; and while it 
              did, man was fully free. The tempter sought to have Adam and Eve 
              become their own gods (which is another way of saying that he sought 
              to have them repudiate the absolute authority of God expressed in 
              and through the law) and choose what was good and evil themselves! 
              The struggle in Eden was over the source of the law. Was it God 
              or was it to be man?</font><br>
