            Strength of Sin is the Law</FONT><br>            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="10-6.gif" alt="Slaves Under Law" width=575 height=400 border="0" align="right"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
            <p>Jesus said, &quot;Whosoever practices sin is the slave of sin.&quot; 
              John 8:34. Sin has a lot of slaves. Not one is happy. They are all 
              miserable. There are the willing slaves, who serve sin with both 
              hands greedily. There are the unwilling slaves, who weary themselves 
              to commit iniquity, who detest their bondage but who are slaves 
              just the same.</p>
            <p>Some fool themselves in thinking that they can leave off sin as 
              soon as they choose. Only those who have really tried to break from 
              its service know that they are held by a mysterious power that no 
              man can master.</p>
            <p>A mysterious power ... What is it? Is sin itself very powerful? 
              Most of us would answer, &quot;Yes.&quot; We glorify sin by imputing 
              to it some wonderful power which it never did have. But sin has 
              no intrinsic power of its own.</p>
            <p>Sin's power to enslave men is derived &#8211; derived from the 
              law of God. Says the apostle Paul, &quot;The strength of sin is 
              the law.&quot; 1 Cor. 15:56. Apart from the law of God, there would 
              be no sin (Rom. 4:15; 5:13), and sin would have no power to hold 
              men in its service. The greatest part of Romans 7 is spent in explaining 
              this great truth.</p>
            </font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First the apostle 
              uses an illustration to show that it is the law which binds us to 
              the service of sin:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the woman 
                which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long 
                as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the 
                law of her husband. So then if, while her husband liveth, she 
                be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: 
                but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that 
                she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. Wherefore, 
                my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of 
                Christ; that ye should be married to Another, even to Him who 
                is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto 
                God. Rom. 7:2-4.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a woman who has 
              a husband. She may hate him and prefer to be married to a better 
              man. But she is held &#8211; bound &#8211; not by the husband but 
              by the law. It is the law which binds her to the husband.</font></p>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            <p>So we by nature are &quot;married&quot; to sin. It is much more 
              desirable to be &quot;married to Another, even to Him who is raised 
              from the dead.&quot; The power that holds us in that first union 
              is not sin but the law. In Romans 7 Paul is talking about becoming 
              &quot;dead to the law&quot; and being &quot;delivered from the law.&quot; 
              vv. 4, 6. The point must be clear: We cannot escape the clutches 
              of sin as long as the law binds us. We need to be &quot;delivered 
              from the law.&quot;</p>
            <p>Then, in verse 5, Paul goes a step further. &quot;While we were 
              living in the flesh [our unregenerate state], our sinful passions, 
              <em>aroused by the law</em>, were at work in our members to bear 
              fruit for death.&quot; Sinful passions aroused by the law! How could 
              one brought up to respect and honor the law tolerate such a thought 
              as this! But now further: &quot;But now we are discharged from the 
              law, dead to that which held us captive.&quot; v. 6. The law holds 
              us captive! How could those who make their boast in the law endure 
              the apostle's message! But further: &quot;But sin, finding opportunity 
              in the commandment, wrought in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart 
              from the law sin lies dead.&quot; v. 8. That is to say, sin has 
              no power apart from the law; but (if we may personify sin) sin goes 
              to the law and says, &quot;Will you grant me permission to take 
              possession of this man?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; says the law, &quot;you 
              have my permission.&quot; Sin goes off with this authority, takes 
              possession of the man and works in him all manner of evil desires.</p>
            <p>The apostle anticipates our question, &quot;Is the law sin?&quot; 
              &quot;God forbid,&quot; he replies. &quot;The law is holy, and the 
              commandment holy, and just, and good.&quot; vv. 7, 12.</p>
            <p>But now the question arises, How can a holy, just and good law 
              bind us to the service of sin, hold us captive and actually give 
              to sin power to work in us all manner of evil desires? Is this the 
              real purpose of the law? Did God give man a law to shut him up in 
              the jail house of sin? </p>
            <p><strong><font size="4">The Purpose of the Law </font></strong></p>
            </font> <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And the commandment, 
                which was ordained unto life, found to be unto death. Rom. 7:10. 
                </font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            <p>Originally the law was ordained to life. God made man perfect and 
              gave him a perfect law. It was a &quot;royal law,&quot; &quot;the 
              law of liberty.&quot; God promised Adam life on condition of perfect 
              obedience. Adam was qualified to render perfect obedience by the 
              very perfection of his nature. As long as he obeyed, the law justified 
              him. The law was his friend and protector.</p>
            <p>Then man rebelled against the law. With all the fury and power 
              of divine authority, the law sentenced him to death, became his 
              jailer and threw him into prison.</p>
            <p>Let me illustrate: You have good laws in this great land. As long 
              as you respect, honor and obey these laws, the law is your friend 
              and protector. But suppose you rebel and become an enemy of the 
              law. What then? The law will become your adversary. It will take 
              hold of you and cast you into prison.</p>
            <p>So it is that the law of God was originally ordained to life. But 
              fallen, rebel man finds it unto death! The law has become his jailer. 
              He has chosen the service of sin, and now the justice of God's law 
              demands that he serve the master of his choice. Justice has bound 
              him over to the miserable service of sin.</p>
            </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suppose a criminal is thrown into jail and sentenced to the hard 
              labor of crushing rocks till the day he dies. He may not have any 
              particular love for crushing rocks. He may prefer doing something 
              else. By what power is he kept at the miserable task? By the power 
              of the law. The law put him into prison, and the law keeps him in 
              prison. The only way he can be delivered from his miserable vocation 
              is to be delivered from the power of the law.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those who remember the 
              world of Charles Dickens could vividly bring to mind the debtor's 
              prison. If a man owed a debt, his creditor could get an injunction 
              against him and have him thrown into prison. He could not come out 
              until he paid the last penny.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are in debt to the 
              law of God in a twofold sense:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. </strong>We owe it <em>fulfillment</em> 
              by a life of perfect obedience.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. </strong>We owe it <em>satisfaction</em> 
              by the kind of death that will meet its penalty.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justice demands that 
              we stay in our debtor's prison, with no hope of coming out until 
              we pay our debt to the law. We are shut in by an omnipotent power. 
              The man who thinks he can break away from the service of sin by 
              anything he can do, is trying to make himself greater than the law, 
              which is as great as God Himself. There is no human power or devising 
              that can deliver us from that just law, which has sentenced us to 
              serve sin.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet all of the human 
              race are &quot;prisoners of hope.&quot;</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the Scripture 
                consigned all things to sin, that what was promised to faith in 
                Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. Now before faith 
                came, we were confined under the law, kept under restraint until 
                faith should be revealed. So that the law was our custodian until 
                Christ came, that we might be justified by faith. Gal. 3:22-24, 
                R.S.V.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justification, which 
              comes by faith, makes the prisoner free. Not that there is any virtue 
              in faith itself, but there is redemption in the object of faith&mdash;Jesus 
              Christ Himself. The gospel is about Jesus Christ and what He has 
              done for us. He so loved us that He considered heaven not a place 
              to be desired while we were prisoners without hope. Seeing that 
              we were hopelessly in debt to the law and that we could never be 
              delivered by our own power, He stepped down and took our place.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But when the fullness 
                of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, 
                made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that 
                we might receive the adoption of sons. Gal. 4:4-5.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In our name and on our 
              behalf, Jesus paid our debt to the law. &quot;Christ hath redeemed 
              us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it 
              is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.&quot; Gal. 
              3:13. Our debt was twofold, and He paid it twofold:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1.</strong> By a life of perfect 
              obedience, He <em>fulfilled </em>the law for us.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2.</strong> By His death on the 
              cross, He <em>satisfied </em>the law for us.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The old Scottish theologians 
              called these the <em>active</em> and<em> passive</em> obedience 
              of Christ. He was our Representative, and what He did was for us&mdash;so 
              that it was just the same as if we had personally done it. We were 
              lost in Adam but restored in Jesus Christ (Rom. 5:17-19). Just as 
              we sinned in Adam, so we lived sinlessly and died to the penalty 
              of the law in Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 5:14). The good news is that 
              we paid our debt in the doing and dying of Jesus Christ.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although Christ has signed 
              our emancipation papers with His own blood, His redemption is effective 
              only when we &quot;repent ... and believe the gospel.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Repentance is sorrow 
              for sin, a change of attitude to the law of God. We were shut up 
              because we were rebels; and just as long as we remain hostile to 
              God's law, we will remain in prison.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I once visited the old 
              convict settlement in Port Arthur, Tasmania. Still exhibited is 
              the &quot;dark room,&quot; where were placed incorrigible prisoners. 
              It was an underground room so dark that the blackness was terrifying. 
              An hour in it would subdue most men. But there was one defiant fellow 
              who was shut up in the &quot;dark room&quot; for a whole day. At 
              the end of the day, the jailer opened the door to see if the poor 
              wretch had had enough. But the prisoner spat in the jailer's face. 
              You can guess what happened. He was locked in again!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The law is our jailer, 
              and we may be sure that no one will get out if he is bent on despising 
              the law of God. No one comes out without repentance.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is faith, however, 
              that frees us from the jail house of sin. Faith lays hold of what 
              Christ has done, and God puts the obedience of Christ to the sinner's 
              account. Therefore he who believes on Jesus Christ has fulfilled 
              the whole law (Rom. 10:4). He is no longer a debtor. Before justice 
              he stands as one who has borne the penalty of sin. He has died to 
              the law in his Substitute, Jesus Christ. And in Jesus Christ he 
              stands before it with a sinless life.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore the law no 
              longer binds the believer in Jesus to the prison house of sin. The 
              jailer, seeing that the debt is paid, opens the jail, and the child 
              of faith is free to pass out. He is no longer bound by the law to 
              that miserable first husband. No longer can sin take occasion from 
              the commandment to work in him all manner of evil desires. Justification 
              makes the believer <em>legally</em> free from the old service of 
              sin.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Faith that Works</strong></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bondage is the result 
              of a wrong relationship to the law. A rebel who hates the law has 
              a wrong relationship to the law. Naturally the law will bind him 
              as a slave to serve sin. The legalist also has a wrong relationship 
              to the law. The doctrine of salvation by means of sincere obedience 
              to the law is the worst kind of antinomianism. The man who holds 
              this doctrine is a debtor, and sin will get permission from the 
              law to stir up all kinds of evil passions in him.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Justification</em> 
              means to be set right before the law. And those who are set right 
              before the law are not bound in prison. What joy to know that when 
              we believe in Jesus Christ, sin has lost all its legal rights over 
              us! We do not have to serve it any more. We have no need to tremble 
              at its power. Faith is not just a nod of assent. It works! Unless 
              it works, it is not faith at all but a counterfeit. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To believe the gospel 
              is to believe that our debt to the law is paid, the law is no longer 
              our jailer and sin has no more power to keep us in its service. 
              How may we prove that we believe this gospel? By our works &#8212; 
              by walking out of the prison house, by rising up in faith and going 
              out of the house of bondage.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The time to exercise 
              faith is not when we feel that sin has lost its power. No indeed! 
              When our sinful nature clamors for indulgence, then is the time 
              to prove the power in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Then it is time 
              for faith to say, &quot;Sin, you have lost all your power to hold 
              me, for I am a believer in Jesus Christ.&quot; He who then steps 
              forward in the faith of God's Word, will find the truth a living 
              reality, for the same omnipotent power that bound him in prison 
              is now on his side to keep him free.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Faith makes the Christian 
              free, and by faith he maintains his freedom. This is freedom not 
              to sin. With faith goes obedience, for the Christian has a new relationship 
              to the law. It is no longer his enemy but his friend. It has become 
              again &quot;the royal law,&quot; &quot;the law of liberty&quot; 
              (James 2:8, 12). He serves it &quot;in newness of spirit, and not 
              in the oldness of the letter&quot; (Rom. 7:6). With Paul he says: 
              &quot;I delight in the law of God after the inward man.&quot; Rom. 
              7:22. &quot;With the mind I myself serve the law of God.&quot; Rom. 
              7:25. &quot;Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: 
              yea, we establish the law.&quot; Rom. 3:31.</font></p>
