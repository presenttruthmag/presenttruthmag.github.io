            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The law of God is something 
              absolute and objective. It is outside and above the fluctuations 
              of human experience. Whenever the authority of God's law is lacking, 
              people must set up some other authority. While the Roman Church 
              has set up the authority of the pope, many of the Protestant churches 
              have set up the authority of human experience.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The aberrations of some 
              of the sects have tended to make evangelicals so suspicious of law 
              and legalism, that there has been a real tendency to run to the 
              opposite extreme and neglect the proper use of the law altogether. 
              Many have obtained the idea that the Christian can live without 
              adherence to any rules or without submission to any discipline. 
              This coincides with the spirit of this permissive age. But the gospel 
              can never be understood or appreciated without the background of 
              law.<br>
              <br>
              We challenge anybody to try to explain any of the great Christian 
              doctrines outside the context of law. It cannot be done! What is 
              sin if there is no law? What is the purpose of the atonement apart 
              from the law? How can you explain repentance or faith if there is 
              no reference to the demands of law? Is not <em>justification </em>itself 
              a legal word which implies setting one right before the law? Consider 
              also that great Bible word <em>righteousness.</em> Girdlestone says:</font></p>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            <ul>
              <font size="2">The word<em> righteous </em>or <em>just</em> (<em>dikaios</em>) 
              is almost always taken in the New Testament to represent that upright 
              and merciful character in conformity with law which we have already 
              met with in the Old Testament; and this is the case whether the 
              word is applied to God, the righteous Judge, to Jesus Christ, &quot;the 
              holy One and the Just,&quot; or to those who shall rise at &quot;the 
              resurrection of the just.&quot;&mdash;R.B. Girdlestone, <em>Synonyms of

            </font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The God of the 
              Old Testament is the God of law. He is the righteous God. All His 
              acts and ways and words are said to be righteous (Ps. 7:9; 145:17; 
              1 Sam. 12:7; Isa. 45:19). Above all, His law is righteous, and He 
              demands absolute obedience to it (Deut. 4:8; Ps. 19:9; 119:160; 
              106:3). Dr. Leon Morris, Australian evangelical scholar, has written:

            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">The 
                importance of law as a category for understanding the ways of 
                God is seen in Abraham's question, &quot;Shall not the Judge of 
                all the earth do right?&quot; (Gen. 18:25). God is designated 
                by the legal term, &quot;Judge.&quot; His relationship to the 
                whole earth may be expressed in legal categories. And the question 
                gives expression to the certainty that He will act in accordance 
                with moral law. The gods of the heathen could not be depended 
                on in this way. They might be expected to react in the most capricious 
                fashion. Not so Jehovah. This difference in understanding the 
                connection of the deity with law may well be the basic reason 
                for the superiority of the religion of Israel to those of the 
                nations round about. Yahweh's actions were always in accordance 
                with law. He could be depended upon to act righteously. And because 
                He was righteous He demanded of His people that they should also 
                act righteously, act in accordance with ethical. law. If they 
                did not, then this same ethical nature of Yahweh demanded that 
                He should punish them. It was inevitable that the wrath of God 
                should be the divine reaction to all sin. The Hebrew could depend 
                on it. It was God's nature to act in this way. Jeremiah can say, 
                &quot;Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; 
                and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time 
                of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord&quot; 
                (Jer. 8:7, marg.). Judgment is as natural to the Lord as the movements 
                of the birds are to them.<br>
                <br>
                Significant also is the fact that the men of the Old Testament 
                sometimes seem to go out of their way to use legal illustrations 
                when they have the divine activity in mind. Today we are inclined 
                to be suspicious of &quot;legalism.&quot; Indeed, if we can convict 
                an opponent of too great an interest in law we are half-way to 
                confuting him. No-one today is interested in a legalist. But we 
                should not read this attitude back into antiquity. Legal categories 
                were used not by way of compulsion, because the legal facts were 
                plain and must be stated. They were used from choice. They were 
                eagerly seized on and used with delight. The men of the Old Testament 
                loved a good legal scene, and they never tire of depicting their 
                God as taking part in one. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="10-5a.gif" alt="The Scroll" width=218 height=288 border="0" align="left"></font></font></p>

The Lord will enter into judgment with the elders of his people&quot; (Isa. 3:13); &quot;the Lord sitteth for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness&quot; (Ps. 9:7f.). Or consider the very majestic legal scene depicted by Micah, &quot;Hear ye now what the Lord saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. Hear, 0 ye mountains, the Lord's controversy, and ye enduring foundations of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel&quot; (Mic. 6: lf.; cf. Is. 41:1, 21; 50:8; Jer. 25:31). The list could be prolonged. <strong>Yahweh and law </strong>went well together ....</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font> </p>

This is not the conception of one or two writers but is found everywhere. It is attested by a variety of conceptions, many of them taken straight from forensic practices. <strong>Among the heathen the deity </strong>was thought of as above all law, with nothing but his own desires to limit him. Accordingly his behaviour was completely unpredictable, and while he made demands on his worshippers for obedience and service, there were few if any ethical implications of this service and none of a logically necessary kind. Far otherwise was it with the God of the Hebrews. The Old Testament never conceives of anything outside Him which can direct His actions, and we must be on our guard against the thought of a law which is over Him. But Yahweh was thought of as essentially righteous in His nature, as incorporating the law of righteousness within His essential Being.&mdash;Leon Morris, <em>The Apostolic Preaching of the Cross </em>(London: Tyndale Press), pp. 253, 254, 256-258.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp; </font></p>

                the Law</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              If righteousness is conformity to the law of Jehovah (Rom. 2:13; Ps. 
              106:3; Luke 1:6), sin is lack of conformity to it. What could be clearer 
              than the words of the apostle John, &quot;Sin is the transgression 
                of the law.&quot; 1 John 3:4.<br>
              <br>
              <em>The Westminster Shorter Catechism</em> says, &quot;Sin is any 
                want of conformity unto, or transgression of, the law of God.&quot; 
              Dr. A.H. Strong likewise says, &quot;Sin is lack of conformity to 
                the moral law of God, either in act, disposition, or state.&quot;&mdash;A.H. 
                Strong, <em>Systematic Theology</em>, p. 549.<br>
              <br>
              Modern theology, however, scorns the simple Bible definition of sin 
              and prefers to use a lot of fancy words to tell us what it is. Paul 
              Tillich, for example, declares that &quot;Sin is the unreconciled 
                duality of ultimate and preliminary concerns, of the finite and that 
                which transcends finitude, of the secular and the holy.&quot;&mdash;Paul 
                Tillich, <em>Systematic Theology</em>, Vol. 1, p. 218. In a meeting 
                of the American Philosophical Association at New Haven, Tillich also 
                said, &quot;When I use the word 'sin' I do not mean anything like 
                the violation of the ten commandments.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Imagine how much conviction of sin would be created in the hearts 
              of those listening to preachers who feed on Tillich! Neither will 
              speaking in generalities prepare the hearts of sinners for the gospel. 
              Ministers who do not wish to disturb the carnal slumbers of sinners, 
              should follow this unfailing rule: Attack sin in general, but never 
              become specific. Abraham Kuyper says:</font></p>            
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><ul>
              <font size="2">Generalities are useless.... Ministers who seek to 
              uncover and expose the man of sin by simply saying that men are 
              wholly lost, dead in trespasses and sin, lack the cutting force 
              which alone can lay open the putrefying sores of the heart.&mdash;Abraham 
              Kuyper, <em>The Work of the Holy Spirit </em>(Grand Rapids: Eerdmans), 
              p. 252. </font> 
            </ul>
            In contrast to a lot of vague, philosophical theology, Lutheran scholar, 
            Edward W.A. Koehler, says:<br>
            <ul>
              <font size="2">The Bible defines sin as &quot;the transgression 
              of the Law,&quot; as &quot;anomia,&quot; lawlessness (1 John 3:4). 
              No deed, word, thought, or desire are in themselves sin, but become 
              sin by being at variance with the Law of God. To eat the fruit of 
              a tree seems to us a rather innocent matter, but since God had forbidden 
              it, it was a sin to Adam and Eve (Gen. 2:17). When Saul spared Agag, 
              the king of Amalek, and the best of the sheep and oxen for sacrifice, 
              it looked like a humane and pious thing; yet God had commanded him 
              to destroy Amalek utterly, and so it was a sin to spare them (1 
              Sam. 15). When at the exodus from Egypt the children of Israel borrowed 
              jewels of silver and gold from the Egyptians (Exod. 12:35, 36), 
              without returning them, it was not a sin, because God expressly 
              commanded them to do this (Exod. 3:22). Whether or not anything 
              is a sin is not determined by what we think, or how we feel, about 
              it, but solely by this: does it or does it not agree with the Word 
              of God? Sin is not a physical, but a moral condition, and it consists 
              in this, that a given act, behaviour, or condition of man is not 
              what God wants it to be; it is noncomformity with the will of God. 
              Thus, to sin means to do what God forbids (Gen. 2:17), or not to 
              do what He enjoins (James 4:17), or not to be as He wants us to 
              be (Lev. 19:2). Hence, with respect to the Law, sin is a departure 
              from its rule; with respect to God, sin is disobedience to His will.<br>
              <br>
              Every departure from the Law is sin, whether this be great or small, 
              known or unknown, intended or accidental, or even when it is against 
              our will (Rom. 7:19). The question whether anything is or is not 
              sin, is not determined by our personal opinion, our knowledge, our 
              intention, or our will, but solely by this one fact, whether or 
              not it is in agreement with the will of God. Our personal attitude 
              may aggravate or mitigate our guilt, but it does not change the 
              nature of the act or the conduct as a transgression of the Law. 
              Even the good intention and purpose one may have, will not change 
              an unlawful act into a lawful one (1 Sam. 15:1-26). We cannot sin 
              to the glory of God (Rom. 6:1).&mdash;Edward W.A. Koehler, <em>A Summary 
              of Christian Doctrine</em>, pp. 62, 63. </font> 
            </ul>
            The apostle Paul makes three decisive statements about the law and 
            sin:<br>
            <ul>
              <font size="2">Where no law is, there is no transgression. Rom. 
              4:15.<br>
              <br>
              Sin is not imputed where there is no law. Rom. 5:13.<br>
              <br>
              I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except 
              the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. Rom. 7:7. </font> 
            </ul>
            </font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From this we may confidently draw the following conclusions:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">1. </font></strong>Where there is no knowledge of the law, there is no knowledge of 
              sin.</font></p>            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="5"><strong>2.</strong></font> Only those who take the law seriously will take sin seriously.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">3.</font></strong> It is useless to preach the gospel to those who have not found 
                  themselves to be sinners before the law or those who are not interested 
                  in coming to terms with its righteous demands. The law is a mirror. 
                  While a man cannot wash his face in a mirror, neither will he desire 
                  to wash his face unless he looks into the mirror and sees his state 
                  of uncleanness.<br>
              <br>
              <B><font size="4">Redemption and the Law</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              Just as we cannot understand what sin is apart from the law, so we 
            cannot understand God's redemptive acts apart from the law. The word 
            redemption, as used in both the Old and New Testament, means a release 
            or deliverance by means of payment. The idea of price must not be 
            forgotten. The word implies deliverance at a cost (see Morris, <em>op. 
                  cit.</em>, pp. 12-64).<br>
              <br>
              While God is omnipotent, we must not entertain the idea that He accomplished 
            our deliverance as an easy matter. This is why the Bible writers use 
            a word which implies deliverance at a great price. The question arises, 
            Why a price? or, To whom did God pay the ransom? One theory of redemption, 
            advocated by some of the church fathers, was that God paid the ransom 
            to the devil. But man did not belong to Satan in the first place. 
            Man might be the devil's captive, but certainly Satan was not man's 
            rightful owner.<br>
              <br>
              The apostle Paul relates <em>redemption </em>to the law when he says, &quot;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law.&quot; Gal. 
                  3:13. Redemption is related to the justice of God, the moral Governor 
                  of the universe. God's justice requires that the law be fulfilled 
                  by a life of perfect obedience, and, where there is a failure to conform 
                  to His holy will, His justice requires satisfaction by an adequate 
                  penalty. God is merciful. He delights in mercy and longs to forgive. 
                  But He is also just and will uphold the moral order of the universe. 
                  Justice is an attribute of God's character just as much as is mercy, 
                  and justice demands that sin be punished and the death penalty executed. 
                  God cannot deny Himself, nor can He act contrary to His nature. The 
                  Bible writers never give the impression that God forgives sin without 
                  regard for justice. The only way God could forgive sinners and remain 
                  just was to see to it that His law was fulfilled by a holy life and 
                  satisfied by a penal death. This required a price so great that God 
                  was the only one in the universe who could save men by meeting the 
                  demands of justice. In the person of His Son, He came to this world 
                  and undertook for us. He stood in our place as our Substitute and 
                  Representative. In our name and on our behalf, He was &quot;made under 
                  the law&quot; (Gal. 4:4). First, by a life of holy obedience, He fulfilled 
                  its just claims of a perfect life. Then, by a shameful death, He bore 
                  the penalty of sin for the race of sinners. All this proved that &quot;God 
                  will not, and God cannot, change His law by one hair's breadth, even 
                  to save a universe of sinners&quot; (Lord Bacon).<br>
              <br>
              It was this view of the atonement which led Adolphe Monod to cry out, &quot;Save first the holy law of my God &#8212; after that you can 
                  save me.&quot; The great Puritan, John Flavell, observed, &quot;Never 
                  was the law of God more highly honored as when Christ stood before 
                  its bar of justice to make reparations for the damage done.&quot; 
              And Spurgeon declared, &quot;I felt that it would not satisfy my conscience 
                  if I could be forgiven unjustly.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              When men see the atonement only as a means of escape for themselves, 
            a mere skillful way to have their sins pardoned, it will not have 
            the necessary ethical and moral motivation that real Christianity 
            will produce. Those who do not see how seriously the atonement takes 
            the law, will not be led to take the law seriously in their daily 
            living. Our view of the atonement tends to be far too subjective. 
            The object of the atonement was not just our salvation but that the 
            divine law and government might be maintained and vindicated.<br>
              <br>
              If there is a failure to relate the atonement to the law, the death 
              of Christ may appear awesome &#8212; but completely unintelligible. 
                  On the one hand, people are left with the impression that an angry, 
                  vindictive God punished His Son so that, being appeased, He could 
                  let us off. (This heathenish view of sacrifice is the philosophy of 
                  antinomianism.) On the other hand, some imagine that there was nothing 
                  in the divine character or government which demanded punishment for 
                  sin. It is said that the death of Christ was merely an exhibition 
                  of God's love designed to change us. (This is the view of liberal 
                  humanism, which denies the Bible principle of salvation by substitution, 
                  representation and penal satisfaction. This is the philosophy of legalism.) </font></p>

              &quot;Repent ye, and believe the gospel,&quot; is the message of 
              the New Testament. Without repentance, none can believe unto salvation. 
              &quot;Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.&quot; But 
              unless men are caused to see what sin is in the light of God's law 
              and what the atonement is in the light of God's law, they are not 
              going to have any true repentance.<br>
              <br>
              The Greek word for repentance (<em>metanoia</em>) literally means 
              a change of mind or attitude  to the 
              law of God, of course! Bible repentance is repentance for sin, and 
              sin is the transgression of the law, or lawlessness (1 John 3:4). 
              The Bible declares, &quot;The carnal mind is enmity against God: 
              for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.&quot; 
              Rom. 8:7. Here we are told that the natural, unrepentant man is 
              hostile to God and to His law. God and His law cannot be separated. 
              Our attitude to one is our attitude to the other. Man is a fugitive 
              from law. Like the prodigal, he thinks that freedom consists in 
              being free from the authority of the Father. But repentance means 
              a wholly new attitude to God and to the authority of His law&mdash;just 
              as the returning prodigal had a completely new view of his father's 
              authority.<br>
              <br>
              How does such repentance come about? Before the apostle Peter called 
              the Jews to repentance on the Day of Pentecost, he told them what 
              they had done and uncovered their awful guilt. Paul says, &quot;I 
              had not known sin, but by the law.&quot; Unless the law of God is 
              proclaimed so that men are brought to see that they are damned sinners 
              who deserve and ought to die, they will not repent. This was the 
              point of Luther's conflict with Agricola, the first great Protestant 
              antinomian.<br>
              <br>
              Agricola said that the law was no longer needed to bring men to 
              repentance. Just preach the love of God and the cross of Christ, 
              and men will come to repentance, he claimed. This insidious opinion 
              threatened to overthrow the cause of the Reformation in Germany. 
              Luther and Melancthon united to oppose this heresy with all the 
              authority of God-given truth, and for future generations they left 
              it clearly on the record of history that the law of God must be 
              maintained and diligently taught in the churches.<br>
              <br>
              We repeat again: Unless the law takes hold of man and convinces 
              him of his utter corruption, lost condition and exposure to the 
              awful penalty of sin, he will not repent.<br>
              <br>
              But there is another element to be considered in repentance. The 
              apostle declares, &quot;The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.&quot; 
              Rom. 2:4. This goodness of divine love and compassion is seen in 
              the cross of Christ. Having seen his awful weight of guilt, the 
              sinner now sees the Son of God bearing it on his behalf as his Substitute. 
              When he sees the holy Father not sparing His own Son, he knows that 
              the holy law can never be abrogated, modified or relaxed. When he 
              understands that the law had to be fulfilled and satisfied before 
              God could justly extend forgiveness to such a poor rebel, he repents. 
              Now he is not just sorry because he fears the consequences of sin. 
              He is sorry for sin. He sees what it has done to his God-given manhood. 
              He sees how it has caused the infinite suffering of the Son of God. 
              With David he cries, &quot;Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, 
              and done this evil.&quot; Instead of remaining hostile to the authority 
              of God's law, he despises his past life of rebellion and is truly 
              sorry that instead of choosing God's way, the way of obedience, 
              he has chosen his own way, followed his own wisdom and sought to 
              be a law unto himself.<br>
              <br>
              Such repentance cannot exist where there remains a wicked intention 
              to sin. Repentance implies an acknowledgment of the authority of 
              God's law. It is to say, &quot;I am sorry for my rebellious disobedience. 
              I am sorry for the suffering it has caused my best Friend.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Of course, no sinner can originate &quot;repentance unto life.&quot; 
              The Spirit of God creates it when the sinner does not resist hearing 
              the law and the gospel.<br>
              <br>
              The Spirit-inspired response to the preaching of law and gospel 
              is always &quot;repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord 
              Jesus Christ&quot; (Acts 20:21). Repentance and faith are inseparable, 
              yet their action is completely different. Repentance acknowledges 
              the authority of God's law and confesses that it ought to be fulfilled. 
              But merely acknowledging what ought to be done will not save anybody. 
              The Bible does not teach that we are saved by repentance. It is 
              by faith that the law is fulfilled (Rom. 10:4), and so it is by 
              faith that we are saved. We must now haste to consider how this 
              relates to the divine economy of salvation.<br>
              <br>
              As Creator, Lawgiver and Governor of the universe (Isa. 33:22), 
              God has made known His moral law, and His justice requires that 
              man render perfect obedience. Those who do the law, and do it all 
              the time, are blessed and justified (Rom. 2:13; Ps. 106:3). Those 
              who fail to do it at all times are cursed and condemned (Gal. 3: 
              1 0; James 2: 1 0). As Luther says, &quot;The law must be fulfilled 
              so that not a jot or tittle shall be lost, otherwise man will be 
              condemned without hope.&quot;&mdash;<em>Luther's Works</em> (Philadelphia: 
              Muhlenberg Press; St. Louis: Concordia), Vol. XXXI, pp. 348, 349. 
              Repentance stands before the law with nothing to pay. But not so 
              with faith. Faith is the eye of the soul which sees that Jesus fulfilled 
              the law of God for us (Matt. 5:17). Faith is the hand that accepts 
              the gospel treasure and brings before God the perfect obedience 
              of Jesus Christ. Faith says, &quot;Mine are Christ's living, doing, 
              and speaking, His suffering and dying; mine as much as if I had 
              lived, done, spoken, and suffered, and died as He did. . . .&quot;&mdash;<em>Ibid</em>., 
              pp. 297, 298. Faith unites the needy soul to Christ and makes that 
              soul a partner of the Lord of the universe, whose righteousness 
              satisfies all the demands of the law. Thus, by faith the whole law&mdash;all 
              that justice requires of us&mdash;is fulfilled, as it is written, &quot;Christ 
              is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.&quot; 
              Rom. 10:4.<br>
              <br>
              Ambrose, one of the church fathers, employs an Old Testament story 
              to illustrate the action of saving faith. Jacob craved the birthright, 
              but he knew he could not receive his father's blessing if he came 
              in his own name and attire. Therefore he came before Isaac in the 
              name and attire of his elder brother and, by so doing, secured the 
              blessing. So faith &quot;begs&quot; or &quot;borrows&quot; the perfect 
              righteousness of our Elder Brother, Jesus Christ. Nay more, faith 
              claims Christ's righteousness as its very own and boldly approaches 
              the eternal throne for the blessing of justification.<br>
              <br>
              In this light, we may understand why Paul protests that faith does 
              not side-step the law but establishes it (Rom. 3:31). To trust wholly 
              in Christ's law-honoring life and death, is the greatest honor that 
              man can give to the law of God. Faith is not a way to get around 
              the law. It is not a clever substitute for obedience. Faith enables 
              the sinner to meet the claims of the law without compromising in 
              any way the moral order of God's government.
            <P><B><font size="4">Justification and the Law</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              <em>Justification</em> is a legal word which means to declare righteous, 
              especially in reference to trial and judgment. It is a word that 
              belongs to the law court. It is therefore impossible to understand 
              this great Bible doctrine unless it is related to law. In the book 
              of Romans, which is the Bible's great charter on justification, 
              the word law is used fifty-six times. Dr. A.H. Strong points out, 
              &quot;Justification is setting one right before law.&quot;&mdash;Strong, 
              <em>op. cit</em>., p. 856.<br>
              <br>
              At the outset of his great statement on justification, the apostle 
              Paul declares, &quot;The doers of the law shall be justified.&quot; 
              Rom. 2:13. This is an eternal truth which can never be modified 
              or relaxed. A just God and a just law will justify a man only on 
              the condition of perfect obedience. There are two ways in which 
              man may meet the terms. Either he can come before God in his own 
              personal obedience, or he may come in the vicarious obedience of 
              Another. But the principle remains: he must bring to God a life 
              which fulfills the law.<br>
              <br>
              The conflict between Rome and the Reformers was not over the question 
              of whether or not righteousness was necessary for justification. 
              Rome taught that men could be justified before God by a <em>personal 
              </em>righteousness (albeit worked in their hearts by an infusion 
              of divine grace). The Reformers said that men could be justified 
              only by a <em>vicarious</em> righteousness (performed by Christ 
              centuries ago and <em>imputed </em>to the believer). The dispute 
              was never about whether the claims of the law should be satisfied 
              but how they are satisfied.<br>
              <br>
              For a thorough discussion of the relationship of justification to 
              the law, we refer the reader to Dr. Buchanan's lecture in the appendix. 
              See also Martin Chemnitz's material in volume 8 of <em>Present Truth 
              Magazine</em>.<br>
              <br>
              The great doctrine of justification by faith has often been taught 
              in such a way that it is positively dishonoring to God and to His 
              law. Many think they are following Paul when they speak contemptuously 
              of the law, not realizing that they are blaspheming the honor and 
              majesty of God Himself. The great apostle unsparingly attacks law 
              as a method of salvation but never, never as a moral and ethical 
            norm.            </font>            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Sanctification and the Law</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              The Reformers all clearly saw that the law has three main uses:<br>
              <br>
              <strong><font size="5">1. </font>Political</strong> &mdash; to restrain evil in society.<br>
              <br>
              <strong><font size="5">2.</font> Theological, or pedagogic</strong> &mdash; to point out sin 
                and to be a schoolmaster (pedagogue) to lead the sinner to Christ.<br>
              <br>
              <strong><font size="5">3. </font>Didactic</strong> &mdash; to be a guide to regenerate Christians.<sup><strong>1</strong></sup><br>
              <br>
              A large section of Protestantism today has either neglected or abandoned 
              the great Biblical and Reformation concept of &quot;the third use 
                of the law.&quot; (And we are not just referring to the liberals, 
                some of whom have wandered so far from &quot;the holy commandment&quot; 
              that they talk of condoning homosexuality.) A number of evangelicals 
              have been actively promoting this brand of &quot;evangelical&quot; antinomianism for years. In fact, the American evangelical movement 
                is largely caught up in the theories of dispensationalism, views 
                which began to be promoted a little more than a hundred years ago 
                in England. Dispensationalism and Reformation theology are incompatible. 
                Dispensationalists deny the third use of the law. As Louis Berkhof 
                says in his <em>Systematic Theology</em> (London: The Banner of 
                Truth Trust), page 614, &quot;it is pure Antinomianism . . . .&quot;<br>
              <br>
              To what does a denial of the third use of the law amount? Lutheran 
              scholar, John Warwick Montgomery, calls it sanctification desanctified 
              (see John Warwick Montgomery, <em>The Suicide of Christian Theology 
                </em>[Minneapolis: Bethany Fellowship, Inc., 19701, pp. 423-428; 
                reprinted in Present Truth, March, 1973). It means the destruction 
                of that great doctrine of Christian sanctification. Why? Because, 
                to use the words of G.C. Berkouwer, &quot;Sanctification and law 
                are inseparable; within their compass moves all of redeemed human 
                life.&quot;&mdash;Berkouwer, <em>op. cit</em>., p. 182.<br>
              <br>
              Just as sin, redemption, atonement, repentance and justification 
              lose all true meaning apart from the law, so does sanctification. 
              Sanctification flows from justification. At the same time as the 
              repentant, believing sinner is justified by the imputation of Christ's 
              righteousness (an act of God external to the sinner), he is renewed 
              by the impartation of the Holy Spirit (an act of God internal to 
              the believer). Justification sets him right before the law legally 
              and positionally, but, being renewed in the spirit of his mind, 
              he begins the life of new obedience. This is sanctification, and 
              it means being conformed to the law of God morally and vocationally. &quot;The children of God are ready to submit themselves to the 
                holy law of God which is now the rule of their lives.&quot;&mdash;<em>Ibid</em>., 
                pp. 191, 192.<br>
              <br>
&quot;Whatever in his [the converted man's] previous course of life 
                was at variance with God's law is at once abandoned.&quot;&mdash;James

                The Banner of Truth Trust), p. 1 1 0. In the gift of the Holy Spirit, 
                God writes His law in the hearts of the justified (Heb. 8:10). They 
                are no longer hostile to it (Rom. 8:7), for the scripture is fulfilled:\

              A full-fledged acknowledgment of the third use of the law, rather 
              than being the offspring of a legalistic orientation, issues from 
              the benefaction of grace which liberates man from a precarious autonomy

              The believer no longer tries to sail heavenwards on clouds of self-righteousness. 
              Having found anchorage in the righteousness of Christ, he has every 
              reason to render obedience to God's law. In this new obedience the 
              law receives again its original function, a function no longer conceivable 
              in abstraction from the grace of God. For now the commandments are 
              to the believer the gracious guidance of the Saviour-God.&mdash;<em>Ibid.</em>,

            Sanctification and law are truly inseparable. Remove one, and you 
            destroy the other.<br>

            <B><font size="4">True Sanctification Versus Religious Subjectivism</font></B><BR>
            <br>
            The holiness-Pentecostal movement majors on the subject of sanctification. 
            We do not disagree with a call to holiness. Surely it is never out 
            of place and is sorely needed in the churches now. But we are against 
            those teachings which leave the impression that holiness, or sanctification, 
            consists in some sort of religious ecstasy or euphoria. Under the 
            influence of this teaching, people think that sanctification is some 
            religious rapture or the exercise of religious feelings and manifestations 
            under extraordinary circumstances. In the minds of too many Christians, 
            sanctification has become some indefinite, sentimental, mystical experience.<br>
            <br>
            Just as we are justified by faith in an objective work (a work external 
            to ourselves), so we are sanctified by faith(ful) obedience to an 
            objective law (the Word of God, which is external to ourselves). Jesus 
            prayed that we might be sanctified by the Word of truth (John 17:17), 
            and the apostle Peter says that the soul is purified by &quot;obeying 
            the truth&quot; (1 Peter 1:22).<br>
            <br>
            Bible sanctification consists in submission to live by something objective&mdash;even 
            the Word of the living God. It means that we no longer seek to be 
            guided by our own wisdom, nor by mysterious and uncertain voices within 
            ourselves.<br>
            <ul>
              <font size="2">The entire life of believers is now subject to the 
              will of Another in genuine heteronomy, not as an oppressive menace 
              to burgeoning life but as the sustaining statutory rule of the Other. 
              It is essential that God's law is imposed from without. Now it comes 
              to man as a threat to his autonomy, nullifies this autonomy, and 
              rids him of its illusions. It would never issue forth from the depths 
              of his own heart. The Scriptures do speak of the law as engraved 
              in the heart of man but this God-given readiness to conform to the 
              law of God by no means annuls its heteronomous nature. For it&mdash;this 
              heteronomous nature of the law&mdash;is completely determined by its being 
              inseparable from the Lawgiver. The law of God is not spread over 
              this world like a net which can be considered by itself; it is the 
              living God who issues that law so that no one can be aware of it 
              without coming in contact with God himself. Therefore the law of 
              God was of such great significance to the people of Israel. Through 
              that law the Lord himself, in all his holiness, approached his people 
              with love and grace. Rightly to understand the Lord is therefore 
              to be docile; and the docile child does not dread his law. To such 
              a child, as to the psalmist who composed Psalm 119, the law is the 
              subject of never-ending litanies.&mdash;Berkouwer, <em>op. cit,</em> pp. 
              176, 177. </font> 
            </ul>
            Once this basic concept of sanctification is lost or abandoned, men 
            have nothing to fall back on but their own subjective experiences. 
            The issue is one of authority&mdash;the authority of God's law versus the 
            authority of human experience.<br>

            <B><font size="4">Three Popular Antinomian Sentiments</font></B><BR>
            <br>
            There are three popular antinomian sentiments which sound so spiritual 
            and pious that they deceive many evangelical Christians. Here they 
            are:<br>
            <br>
            <strong><font size="5">1.</font></strong> &quot;When you have the love of Christ in your 
            heart, you don't need the Ten Commandments because love is the fulfilling 
            of the law.&quot; But while the love of Christ constrains the Christian 
            (2 Cor. 5:14), it does not inform the Christian as to the proper content 
            of that action. This has been well stated by Horatius Bonar, beloved 
            hymnologist and author, who in his book, <em>God's Way of Holiness</em>, 
            writes:<br>
            <ul>
              <font size="2">But will they tell us what is to regulate service, 
              if not law? Love, they say. This is a pure fallacy. Love is not 
              a rule, but a motive. Love does not tell me what to do; it tells 
              me how to do it. Love constrains me to do the will of the beloved 
              one; but to know what the will is, I must go elsewhere. The law 
              of our God is the will of the beloved one, and were that expression 
              of his will withdrawn, love would be utterly in the dark; it would 
              not know what to do. It might say, I love my Master, and I love 
              his service, and I want to do his bidding, but I must know the rules 
              of his house, that I may know how to serve him. Love without law 
              to guide its impulses would be the parent of will-worship and confusion, 
              as surely as terror and self-righteousness, unless upon the supposition 
              of an inward miraculous illumination, as an equivalent for law. 
              Love goes to the law to learn the divine will, and love delights 
              in the law, as the exponent of that will; and he who says that a 
              believing man has nothing more to do with law, save to shun it as 
              an old enemy, might as well say that he has nothing to do with the 
              will of God. For the divine law and the divine will are substantially 
              one, the former the outward manifestation of the latter. And it 
              is &quot;the will of our Father which is in heaven&quot; that we 
              are to do (Matt. 7:21), so proving by loving obedience what is that 
              &quot;good and acceptable, and perfect will of God&quot; (Rom. 12:2). 
              Yes, it is he that doeth &quot;the will of God that abideth forever&quot; 
              (1 John 2:1 7); it is to &quot;the will of God&quot; that we are 
              to live (1 Pet. 4:2); &quot;made perfect in every good work to do 
              his will&quot; (Heb. 13:21); and &quot;fruitfulness in every good 
              work,&quot; springs from being &quot;filled with the knowledge of 
              his will&quot; (Col. 1:9, 10). </font> 
            </ul>
            Plain-speaking D. L. Moody says:<br>
            <ul>
              <font size="2">The people must be made to understand that the Ten 
              Commandments are still binding, and that there is a penalty attached 
              to their violation. We do not want a gospel of mere sentiment. The 
              Sermon on the Mount did not blot out the Ten Commandments.<br>
              <br>
              When Christ came He condensed the statement of the law into this 
              form: &quot;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart 
              and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy 
              mind, and thy neighbor as thyself.&quot; Paul said: &quot;Love is 
              the fulfilling of the law.&quot; But does this mean that the detailed 
              precepts of the Decalogue are superseded and have become back numbers? 
              Does a father cease to give children rules to obey because they 
              love him? Does a nation burn its statute books because the people 
              have become patriotic? Not at all. And yet people speak as if the 
              commandments do not hold for Christians because they have come to 
              love God. Paul said: &quot;Do we then make void the law through 
              faith? God forbid. Yea, we establish the law.&quot; It still holds 
              good. The Commandments are necessary.&mdash;D.L. Moody,<em> Weighed and 
              Wanting</em>, pp. 17, 18. </font> 
            </ul>
            </font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">2. </font></strong>&quot;When 
              you are filled with the Holy Spirit, you don't need the law because 
              the Holy Spirit tells you what to do.&quot; This is the kind of 
              fanaticism that Luther had to meet in the more radical Anabaptists. 
              They made a cleavage between Word and Spirit, and thought they could 
              receive communications and revelations from the Spirit quite apart 
              from the objective Word of God. The tragedy is that those who want 
              to be led by God and want Him to speak to them apart from the guidance 
              of the words of the Bible, have no way of telling the difference 
              between the Holy Spirit and their own carnal religious impressions. 
              They try to live by uncertain voices within themselves. But the 
              true work of the Spirit is to teach Christians not to live by inward 
              resources but by trusting submission to an objective authority. 
              The Holy Spirit bears witness to the truth, and God's Word is the 
              truth. Anyone who gives the slightest hint that he need not carefully 
              study the Bible to determine God's will for his life, is not led 
              by the Spirit of God.<br>
              <font size="5"><br>
              <strong>3.</strong> </font>&quot;The essential thing is a warm, heart relationship 
              with Christ. When you have this personal relationship, you don't 
              live by the do's and don'ts of the law.&quot; This sentiment should 
              be consigned back to its right place &#8212; to the father of lies.<br>
              <br>
              Certainly a Christian does not live by the commandments of men. 
              He pays no attention to the do's and don'ts of <em>human </em>traditions. 
              This is what Paul is talking about in Colossians 2:14-22. &quot;Let 
              no man therefore judge you . . . after the commandments and doctrines 
              of men.&quot; But may God help us if we think that Paul is talking 
              about the commandments of God. In another place the apostle says, 
              &quot;Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but 
              the keeping of the commandments of God.&quot; 1 Cor. 7:19.<br>
              <br>
              The essential thing is a relationship with God, true! But let us 
              not forget that <em>God sets the terms of that relationship</em>. 
              His terms are obedience. Let us not fool ourselves in thinking that 
              we can get above the do's and don'ts of God's Word. There are plenty 
              of do's and don'ts in the New Testament just as well as in the Old. 
              The epistles of Paul are full of imperatives: don't lie to one another; 
              don't let the sun go down on your wrath; don't judge and criticize 
              your brother; don't eat (the sacrament) with immoral men; don't 
              be conformed to this world; don't take a brother in the faith before 
              a law court; and many, many more. Try reading Romans 12 to 14, and 
              see how many do's and don'ts are given to us. Or read Ephesians 
              4 to 6, Colossians 3 to 4 and 1 Thessalonians 5.<br>
              <br>
              Our keeping the commandments of God does not establish our relationship 
              with God. This is purely of grace, on account of Christ, through 
              faith. (&quot;I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee 
              out of the land of Egypt.&quot;) The duty of hearing and obeying 
              Him springs out of the fact that He has delivered us and established 
              a Father-son relationship with us. The &quot;Thou shalt nots&quot; 
              plainly spell out the things that will spoil that relationship.<br>
              <br>
              God even saw fit to impose some do's and don'ts on man in his sinless 
              state. To Adam and Eve He said, &quot;Of the tree of the knowledge 
              of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it.&quot; We can imagine 
              the deceiver saying to the woman, &quot;Listen, Eve. If you have 
              a warm, loving relationship with God, that is all that matters. 
              Since you have now achieved this wonderful experience, you have 
              no need to live by the do's and don'ts of the law. In fact, the 
              way you can prove you have entered this higher experience is to 
              eat this fruit. That will prove that the only thing that matters 
              is a love relationship with God.&quot; Eve forgot that divine love 
              set the terms of that relationship. Through disobedience the relationship 
              was destroyed.<br>
              <br>
              God remembers that we are but dust. Because of Christ He does not 
              impute sin to the faltering lives of the stumbling saints. But He 
              cannot be in fellowship with those who &quot;rebel against God's 
              law by changing its demands and accommodating them to their own 
              capacity. This is done by eliminations in the Decalogue and also 
              by additions&quot; (Edmund Schlink, <em>Theology of the Lutheran 
              Confessions</em> [Philadelphia: Fortress Press] , p. 75).<br>

              <br>
              If the great doctrine of justification is to be restored to its 
              rightful place in the church, we must preach &quot;the second use 
              of the law&quot; &#8212; the law to point out sin, the law as a 
              schoolmaster to lead to Jesus Christ (Gal. 3:24).<br>
              <br>
              If the great doctrine of sanctification is to be restored to its 
              rightful place in the church, we must proclaim &quot;the third use 
              of the law&quot; &#8212; the law as a guide to justified believers.<br>
              <br>
              If the second use of the law falls, so does the third, or vice versa. 
              Then there is neither a correct basis for justification nor for 
              sanctification. This is why the church is drowning in an unprecedented 
              flood of religious subjectivism.<br>
              <br>
              Again: we are justified by faith in an objective work, and we are 
              sanctified by faith(ful) obedience to an objective law.<br>
              <br>
              Let the church return to her unabashed allegiance to God's Word. 
              Let her not be ashamed of her conscientious obedience to the commandments 
              of God. Let her not be afraid to call sin by its right name. Let 
              her shake off all traces of sentimental subjectivism. Let her take 
              up the two-edged sword of law and gospel. Then will she again look 
              &quot;forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, 
              and terrible as an army with banners.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              <font size="-1"><sup>1</sup> With regard to the third use of the 
              law, some have tried to argue that Luther did not agree with Melancthon 
              (who first coined the expression, &quot;the third use of the law&quot;) 
              and Calvin (who deals with the law's third use in great detail in 
              his Institutes of the Christian Religion.). But their claim is not 
              in harmony with the facts. What could be clearer than Luther's <em>Small 
              Catechism</em>: &quot;The purpose of the law is to train people 
              to be decent and orderly, to show them that they are sinners so 
              that they may repent and turn to Christ, and to serve as the rule 
              of life for Christians.&quot; In <em>The Theology of Martin Luther</em>, 
              Paul Althaus says, &quot;Luther saw the commandments not only as 
              a mirror in which he recognizes sin&mdash;although they certainly are 
              and remain that even for the Christian&mdash;but beyond this as instruction 
              about the 'good works' God wants; and such instruction is necessary 
              and wholesome for the Christian.... Luther does not use the expression 
              'the third function of the law (tertius usus legis).' Melancthon 
              did use this expression and it was then adopted in the Formula of 
              Concord, in Lutheran orthodoxy and by nineteenth century theology. 
              In substance, however, it also occurs in Luther.&quot;&mdash;Paul Althaus, 
              <em>The Theology of Martin Luther</em>, pp. 272, 273. Reformed scholar, 
              G.C. Berkouwer, says this about Luther: &quot;Convinced though he 
              was of the sovereignty of God's grace and of our inability to be 
              justified by the works of the law, he nevertheless held the law 
              in high esteem and spoke of its threefold intent to maintain the 
              external order, to induce sinners to recognize their guilt, and
