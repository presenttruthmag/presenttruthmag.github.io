            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Righteousness may be 
            defined simply as &quot;that character or quality of being just or 
            right.&quot; The standard of righteousness is set forth in God's person 
            and law. The Scriptures distinguish at least four aspects, or kinds, 
            of righteousness.<br>
            <P><B><font size="4">1. The Righteousness of God</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              Righteousness is an essential attribute of God's being. &quot;But 
              if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what 
              shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is 
              He? (I am speaking in human terms.)&quot; Rom. 3:5. This attribute 
              of God is unchanging and unchangeable. He is holy, righteous and 
              just in the absolute and final sense. It is impossible for Him to 
              deviate from His righteousness. There is not so much as a &quot;shadow 
              of turning&quot; with Him. The righteous God cannot look upon sin 
              with the least degree of allowance. &quot;Thine eyes are too pure 
              to approve evil, and Thou canst not look upon wickedness with favor.&quot; 
              Hab. 1:13. As a result, judgment has come upon all unto condemnation. 
              And ultimately it will be visited upon the unrepentant and unbelieving 
              sinner.<br>
              <br>
              God is also righteous in all His ways. This is true even in the 
              gospel. In the goodness of the grace of God, He is not just lenient 
              with regard to sin and willing to overlook it because He is loving. 
              God in no way belittles sin either in salvation or in His other 
              dealings with mankind. And we will see that God even saves us by 
              His righteousness and righteously.
            <P><B><font size="4">2. Man's Self-righteousness</font></B><BR>
              <br>
              In speaking about his brethren according to the flesh, Paul referred 
              to many who had a zeal for God but not in accordance with knowledge. 
              &quot;For not knowing about God's righteousness, and seeking to 
              establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness 
              of God.&quot; If we will only stop to consider, we cannot but be 
              impressed with the fact that we spend a great deal of time at self-justification 
              &mdash; seeking to make ourselves acceptable to ourselves, to others and 
              to God.
            <P>However, in the light of God's Word, man's righteousness is anything 
              but acceptable. Actually, man's righteousness is considered as filthy 
              rags in God's sight (Isa. 64:6). God's description of man with respect 
              to his own righteousness is very vivid and certainly not very complimentary. 
              Romans 3:9-18 declares:
            <ul>
              <font size="2">&quot;. . . all [are] under sin; as it is written,<br>
              &quot;There is none righteous, not even one;<br>
              There is none who understands,<br>
              There is none who seeks for God;<br>
              All have turned aside, together they have become useless;<br>
              There is none who does good,<br>
              There is not even one.&quot;<br>
              &quot;Their throat is an open grave,<br>
              With their tongues they kept deceiving,&quot;<br>
              &quot;The poison of asps is under their lips;&quot;<br>
              &quot;Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;&quot;<br>
              &quot;Their feet are swift to shed blood,<br>
              Destruction and misery are in their paths,<br>
              And the path of peace have they not known.&quot;<br>
              &quot;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&quot; </font> 
            </ul>
            What a description of man! And how different than man's evaluation 
            of himself! But this is as God sees us in His &quot;all-righteousness.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Why does man miss the mark so widely concerning self? No doubt it 
            is always difficult to make a subjective evaluation of ourselves. 
            But also we find that man's great mistake lies in the fact that his 
            standards are arrived at by comparing himself with others. &quot;But 
            when they measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves 
            with themselves, they are without understanding.&quot; 2 Cor. 10:12.<br>
            <br>
            We need to be reminded again and again that it is not only those who 
            are condemned by society and regarded as reprobates that are lost, 
            but &quot;all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God&quot; 
            (Rom. 3:23). We are all together become unprofitable. Our sins have 
            separated us from God. There is no possible way whereby our righteousness 
            can make us acceptable to Him. It can only condemn us!<br>

              The Righteousness of Faith (imputed)</font></B></font></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But now apart from 
                the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed 
                by the Law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God through 
                faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is 
                no distinction. Rom. 3:21, 22.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The imputed, reckoned, 
              or gift, righteousness of God to sinful man transcends all Christian 
              themes. There is nothing to compare with this in all of human thought, 
              secular or religious. Natural man cannot conceive of it, and, for 
              that matter, even some Christians find it hard to really grasp. 
              There seems to be almost an instinctive fear among sincere people 
              that this righteousness of faith would mean the end of all &quot;real&quot; 
              righteousness within and among people. Most people no doubt feel 
              that to say we do not have a righteousness of our own that is acceptable 
              to God and He will be satisfied with a righteousness of Another, 
              reckoned to our account, would just be a stimulus to sins of all 
              kinds. However, human reasoning must not determine the issue for 
              us at this point. It must be determined by the revelation of the 
              Word of God! The fact of the imputation of righteousness, or the 
              reckoned righteousness of God, is certainly taught in the Bible. 
              And its importance is transcendent.<br>
              <br>
              Does God operate on the principle of imputation? Let us consider 
              this for a moment. Adam sinned, and his sin ruined the human race. 
              We are sinners by nature. We all carry within us the virus of original 
              sin because of our identification with Adam. Death is the penalty 
              of Adam's sin, and this is the lot of all men according to Romans 
              5:12: &quot;Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into 
              the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, 
              because all sinned.....&quot; However, the Bible is crystal clear 
              concerning the fact that the sin of man was imputed, or reckoned, 
              to Christ. Jesus Christ is our sin offering, our propitiation.</font></p>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            <ul>
              <font size="2">And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; 
              and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world. 1 
              John 2:2.<br>
              <br>
              For the love of God controls us, having concluded this, that One 
              died for all, therefore all died.... He made Him who knew no sin 
              to be sin on our behalf, that we might become the righteousness 
              of God in Him. 2 Cor. 5:14, 21.<br>
              <br>
              Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse 
              for us&mdash;for it is written, &quot;Cursed is every one who hangs on 
              a tree.&quot; Gal. 3:13. </font> 
            </ul>
            And of course the principle of imputation is apparent throughout the 
            Old Testament. We read in Isaiah 53:6: &quot;All of us like sheep 
            have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; but the Lord 
            has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him.&quot;<br>
            <ul>
              <font size="2">Jesus paid it all,<br>
              All to Him I owe;<br>
              Sin had left a crimson stain;<br>
              He washed it white as snow. </font> 
            </ul>

              am about to state at this point is the most wonderful truth in all

              that it should become so commonplace to us that it does not stir 
              us! Here it is! </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is not brought about by man, for &quot;Salvation is of the 
                        Lord.&quot; It is not increased by our goodness in any sense, nor 
                        is it decreased by our failures, which often befall us, contrary 
                        to our deepest desires. The new life of the believer is one of continual faith in the blood of Christ and a continual life of repentance. We can never, this side of eternity, get beyond repentance towards God and faith in the blood of Jesus <br>
              <br>
              In this day of religious subjectivism, how important it is to be 
              reminded again and again of the tremendous fact that our acceptance 
              with God is dependent upon something outside of ourselves! This 
              is not an experience within us. It is an experience in the heart 
              of God as he reckons the believer righteous for Jesus' sake. This 
              is the beginning of all God's work for us and in us.<br>
              <br>
              Multitudinous are the Biblical illustrations concerning imputation 
              to which we might call attention. There are, of course, the Old 
              Testament sacrifices. The sinner confessed his sin over an animal, 
              and then that animal was killed. It was the identification, typically 
              in this case, of the sinner with his substitute that was in view 
              as the animal was killed. The sinner's sin made him worthy of death. 
              And that penalty of death was met in another. Christ is the antitype 
              of that substitutionary sacrifice.<br>
              <br>
              Likewise, we think of Abraham, father of the faithful. &quot;He 
                        believed God, and it was reckoned [or imputed) to him for righteousness.&quot; 
              Gen. 15:6. This happened when he believed God concerning the promised 
              Seed that would come &#8212; Jesus Christ.<br>
              <br>
              The little epistle of Philemon provides a delightful illustration 
              of<em> imputation</em>. Philemon was a slave owner whose slave Onesimus 
                        had stolen from him and run away. Apparently Onesimus was apprehended 
                        in Rome and put in prison. There, Paul, who was also in prison, 
                        but for the gospel, made contact with Onesimus and apparently led 
                        him to Jesus Christ. Upon his release, it was Onesimus' responsibility 
                        to go back to his master. So Paul decided to send a letter along 
                        with him. This was to make it easier for Onesimus to return, for 
                        Paul had also been instrumental in leading Philemon to the Lord. 
                        In verses 17 and 18 of his epistle, the apostle wrote to Philemon, &quot;If then you regard me a partner, accept him [Onesimus] as 
                        you would me. But if he has wronged you in any way, or owes you 
                        anything, charge that to my account.&quot; This is a superb illustration 
                        of what the Lord Jesus does for me. Jesus says to the Father, &quot;if 
                        then You regard Me as a partner, accept him [Andrew Johnson] as 
                        You would Me. But if he has wronged You in any way [and I have], 
                        or owes You anything [and I do], charge that to My account.&quot; Oh, how wonderful! My sins have been reckoned to Jesus, and His 
                perfect righteousness has been reckoned to my account.</font></p>            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is<em> justification 
              </em>by imputed righteousness. This affects our objective standing 
              before God, not our inward state. This standing is brought about 
              upon our believing in Jesus Christ. Our state, or sanctification, 
              consists of our growth in grace and in knowledge of our Lord Jesus 
              Christ. But do not forget that our acceptance with God is dependent 
              upon what Christ has done for us and our faith in just that. &quot;Faith 
              is counted for righteousness.&quot;</font></p>

              <br>
              Finally, there is the righteousness <em>imparted</em> to us by the 
              Holy Spirit. God has done a work <em>for us</em> that is the basis 
              of our acceptance with God. And all that God does <em> in us</em> 
              is a <em>result</em> of this. In Romans 8:4 we read, &quot;. . . 
              that the righteous requirements of the law might be fulfilled<strong><em> 
              </em></strong><em>in us</em>, who walk not after the flesh but after 
              the Spirit.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              Upon his believing, the believer in Jesus Christ is <strong><em>indwelt 
              </em></strong>and filled with the Spirit. The Holy Spirit produces 
              His fruit of righteousness in the life of the believer&mdash;not because 
              of any specific act or attitude or condition fulfilled toward the 
              Holy Spirit but because of simple faith in the<em><strong> finished</strong></em> 
              work of Jesus Christ. According to Galatians 5:22, 23, the normal 
              life of the believer in Jesus Christ is a living out of the fruit 
              of the Spirit, which is &quot;lave, joy, peace, patience, kindness, 
              goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things 
              there is no law.&quot; And in Philippians 1: 1 1 Paul says, &quot;. 
              . . having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes 
              through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              The gifts for service from the ascended Christ are produced by the 
              Holy Spirit of God in our lives. &quot;But to <em>each one</em> 
              is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.&quot; 
              1 Cor. 12:7.<br>
              <br>
              Again, the fruit and gifts of the Spirit are not produced by self-effort 
              by the believer but in the believer by the Holy Spirit (see Rom. 
              4). However, this ought not to be thought of as a mystical experience 
              highly fraught with emotion and preoccupation with self or even 
              with the person and the work of the Holy Spirit. The righteous requirements 
              of God's law are fulfilled in us as we obey God's will. The law 
              is still the standard, and always will be the standard, of God's 
              righteousness. We are not justified by it, nor should we be motivated 
              by it, nor even enabled by it; but it is still the standard that 
              will be fulfilled in us as we walk not after the flesh but after 
              the Spirit.<br>
              <br>
              This will not be done perfectly or completely, but it will be done 
              <em>significantly</em> and <em>growingly.</em> This evidences the 
              reality of our being children of God. And certainly it evidences 
              the reality of our sanctification. Strictly speaking, our justification 
              does not depend upon sanctification. However, justification is evidenced 
              by sanctification, and this should be a growing and increasing development 
              in our lives as we learn more perfectly the will of God and appropriate 
              His grace day by day.<br>
              <br>
              A word of warning: Imparted, or infused, righteousness made possible 
              by the Holy Spirit of God as we obey the will of God, should never 
              overshadow our appreciation for the imputed righteousness of God 
              in our thinking. Our imputed righteousness is objective and perfect; 
              our imparted righteousness is subjective and imperfect. This is 
              not to demean the work of grace in our hearts in sanctification. 
              However, all that God works in us is but an earnest (down payment) 
              of the redemption of the purchased possession that will be ours 
              when we come to glory. May we with Paul &quot;press on toward the 
              goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.&quot; 
              And may we say with the apostle:
            <ul>
              <font size="2">Not that I have already obtained it, or have already 
              become perfect, but I press on in order that I may lay hold of that 
              for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus. Brethren, I do 
              not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I 
              do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies 
              ahead, I press on toward the goal. Phil. 3:12-14. </font> 
            </ul>
            </font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Humility is always 
              becoming to the believer in Jesus Christ. We ought not to be calling 
              attention to ourselves, to our achievement and to what spirituality 
              we may have attained. But rather, let us extol the grace of our 
              Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, our Saviour, who loved us and 
              gave Himself for us.</font></p>
