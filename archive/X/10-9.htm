            <font size="2">Buchanan's <em>The Doctrine of Justification</em> is 
            a classic of English Protestantism. We highly recommend it to our 
            readers. It is obtained through The Banner of Truth Trust, P.O. Box 
            652, Carlisle, Pennsylvania 17013. In this issue of Present Truth, 
            we are placing the lecture on &quot;The Law and Justice of God&quot; in an appendix. No doubt some will not venture to wade through it, 
            but those who do will be greatly rewarded by this masterful presentation.&mdash;Ed.</font><br>
            <br>
            It may be safely affirmed that almost all the errors, which have prevailed 
            on the subject of Justification, may be traced ultimately to erroneous, 
            or defective, views of the Law and Justice of God. His Law has either 
            been supposed to be mutable and variable, so as to admit of being 
            relaxed and modified,&mdash;as if its preceptive and penal requirements 
            had no necessary connection with the demands of His eternal justice; 
            or, it has been set aside altogether, as if its claims might be superseded 
            by the divine prerogative of mercy, and as if a sinner could be pardoned 
            and accepted without any provision being made for its fulfillment. 
            It is the more necessary to consider Justification in its relation 
            to the Law and Justice of God, because erroneous or defective views 
            on this point, have been the chief source, not only of many speculative 
            errors, but also of that practical unconcern,&mdash;that false peace and 
            carnal security, &mdash;which prevails so extensively both in the Church 
            and the world; and which springs, not from faith in the Gospel message, 
            but from unbelief in the divine Law. For this reason, as well as from 
            its close connection with the work of Christ, in fulfilling the Law, 
            and satisfying the Justice of God, this topic is one of fundamental 
            importance.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Prop. VI.</b> As Justification is a forensic, legal, or judicial 
            term, so that which is denoted by it must necessarily have some relation 
            to the Law and Justice of God.<br>
            <br>
            The truth of this proposition, in so far as it relates to the Justification 
            of innocent and holy beings in a state of probation and trial, can 
            scarcely be denied by any one who believes in a righteous moral government. 
            The Law of God, in whatever way it was made known to them, was the 
            rule of His moral government, and consequently the ground of His judicial 
            sentence in regard to them; and His Law being a revelation of His 
            essential and eternal character as a righteous Governor and Judge, 
            His Justice can neither condemn any who are not guilty, nor accept 
            any who are not righteous. To be accepted as righteous in His sight, 
            every subject of that law must have a righteousness answerable to 
            its requirements; for, if it be true that where 'there is no law there 
            is no transgression,' it is equally true that where there is no law, 
            there is no 'righteousness;' and if 'sin is not imputed, where there 
            is no law,' neither can righteousness be imputed without reference 
            to its requirements. The rule in both cases is the same,&mdash;and righteousness 
            is nothing else than conformity to the Law, while sin is any want 
            of conformity to it. That Law, considered as the rule of His moral 
            government, requires perfect obedience; and as partial compliance 
            with it is inadmissible, so it is impossible, from its very nature, 
            that there can be any neutral character,<br>
            &mdash;which is neither godly nor ungodly,&mdash;neither righteous nor wicked,&mdash;neither 
            innocent nor guilty, &mdash; neither justified nor condemned.<br>
            <br>
            Such being the nature of God's Law,&mdash;and that Law being an expression 
            of His Justice,&mdash;it follows, that Justification must necessarily have 
            some relation to both. In the case of the innocent, Justification 
            would have consisted in the recognition and acceptance of a righteousness, 
            personal and inherent, and amounting to a perfect conformity to the 
            divine Law; in the case of the sinful, Justification,&mdash;if it be possible 
            at all,&mdash;must still have some relation to the Law and Justice of God; 
            since it includes the pardon of sin, which reverses the sentence of 
            condemnation; and the acceptance of the sinner as righteous, which 
            implies some standard of righteousness as the rule of the divine procedure. 
            What that righteousness is, or can be, in the case of the guilty, 
            is the great problem which is solved only by the Gospel of Christ.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Prop. VII.</b> The rule of Justification, as revealed to man in 
            his state of original righteousness, was the Law of God in the form 
            of a divine covenant of life.<br>
            <br>
            There is a difference between the Moral Law, or the Law of Nature, 
            considered simply as such, and the first revealed covenant of life: 
            for although this covenant presupposed that law, and was founded upon 
            it, the one cannot be identified, in all respects, with the other. 
            The Moral Law, considered simply as the law of man's nature, was a 
            rule of duty, which prohibited all sin, and required perfect obedience; 
            and, considered as the instrument of God's righteous government, it 
            necessarily implied the sanctions of reward and punishment, for these 
            are the indispensable conditions of all government, and without them 
            any rule of obedience would have been a mere exhortation or advice, 
            rather than a formal law. But a Moral Law, however perfect, and although 
            armed with the sanctions of reward and punishment, is not necessarily 
            a covenant of life. It could only denounce punishment in the event 
            of disobedience, and secure entire exemption from punishment, with 
            such blessings as might be connected with obedience, while man continued 
            in a state of holy innocence; but, considered simply as a law, or 
            an instrument of government, it could give no assurance, either that 
            he would continue in that state, or that, by continuing in it, he 
            would ever become a confirmed heir of eternal life. Man might be naturally 
            immortal, as a being destined,&mdash;not by the necessity of his nature, 
            but by the sovereign appointment of God,&mdash;to an eternal existence; 
            and yet as a subject of His government, the law under which he was 
            placed could give him no assurance, that he could persevere in obedience, 
            either in time or in eternity, so as to be exempt from its penalties, 
            and entitled to an everlasting reward. The tenure by which life should 
            be held, and the conditions of a holy and happy immortality, could 
            not be discovered by the mere light of nature, even in a state of 
            pristine innocence; and could only be made known by a revelation of 
            God's sovereign will.<br>
            <br>
            We find, accordingly, that this precise point was one of the earliest 
            subjects of divine revelation. God is said to have promulgated a positive 
            command, as the test of man's obedience; and to have annexed to it 
            the threatening of death, in the event of transgression, with the 
            promise of eternal life, which was signified and sealed by its sacramental 
            symbol 'the tree of life'&mdash; in the event of his continued obedience 
            during the term of his probation. The threatening, in the one case, 
            included the whole penalty of sin; and the promise, in the other, 
            the whole reward of obedience: and both had reference to the same 
            life which Adam then possessed, as having been created 'in the image 
            and likeness' of God. The penalty might contain many distinct privations 
            and sufferings; but the worst part of it, and that which embittered 
            every other, was the curse of God,&mdash;the instant forfeiture of His favour, 
            and the inevitable subjection to His wrath. The promise might comprehend 
            many distinct benefits, temporal, spiritual, and eternal; but the 
            best part of it, and that which sweetened every other, was the blessing 
            of God,&mdash;the enjoyment of 'His favour, which is life, and of His lovingkindness, 
            which is better than life.'<br>
            <br>
            By the addition of a positive appointment as a test of man's obedience 
            to God as the supreme Lawgiver, Governor, and Judge, whose will man 
            was bound to obey by the law of his moral nature, that law was converted 
            into a divine covenant of life. It was not, like many covenants between 
            man and man, a mutual agreement between equal and independent parties,&mdash;for 
            this had been at variance with the rightful supremacy of God, and 
            the dutiful subjection of the creature; it was a constitution authoritatively 
            imposed, as a test of man's obedience: for 'the Lord God commanded 
            the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat'&mdash;including 
            'the tree of life in the midst of the garden,' which was the symbol 
            and sacrament of His covenant promise,&mdash;'but of the tree of the knowledge 
            of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day thou eatest 
            thereof thou shalt surely die.' And yet it was more than a mere law; 
            it was a law in the form of a covenant. In the words of Bishop Hopkins, 
            'If God had only said, &quot;Do this,&quot; without adding, &quot;Thou 
            shalt live,&quot; this had not been a covenant, but a law; and if 
            He had only said, &quot;Thou shalt live,&quot; without commanding 
            &quot;Do this,&quot; it had not been a covenant, but a promise. Remove 
            the condition, and you make it a simple promise; remove the promise, 
            and you make it an absolute law: but, both these being found in it, 
            it is both a law and a covenant.' In this form, the law continued 
            to be binding on man by its precept, but God condescended, also, to 
            bind Himself by His promise, and became, in the expressive words of 
            Boston, 'debtor to His own faithfulness' to make that promise good. 
            A new element was thus introduced into man's relation to God: he was 
            still a creature dependent on the power, and subject to the law, of 
            his Creator; but he was now advanced to be a 'confederate' with Him, 
            and, as long as he continued to obey, could look to Him as his covenant 
            God.<br>
            <br>
            But there is a wider difference still between the Moral Law, considered 
            simply as the law of man's nature, and the law in its positive form, 
            as a divine covenant of life. The law, as it was originally inscribed 
            on the moral nature of man, was a personal rule of duty,&mdash;it laid an 
            obligation on each individual singly,&mdash;and held him responsible only 
            for himself; but the law, as it was subsequently promulgated in the 
            form of a divine covenant, was a generic constitution imposed by supreme 
            authority on the first father of the human race, as the representative 
            of his posterity,&mdash;and extending far beyond his individual interests, 
            so as to affect the character and condition even of his remotest descendant. 
            He was constituted, by divine appointment, the trustee for the whole 
            race which should spring from him; and was placed in the deeply responsible 
            position of their covenant head, and legal representative. He was 
            a party to the covenant, not simply as a private individual, acting 
            for himself alone, but as a public person, invested with an official 
            character, and acting also for others. He could not have assumed this 
            office, or acted in this capacity, of his own will; he must have been 
            constituted the legal representative of his posterity by the same 
            supreme will, which enacted the law under which he was placed.<br>
            <br>
            The fact of this federal arrangement is revealed, &mdash;the reason of it 
            must be resolved ultimately into the sovereign will, and supreme wisdom, 
            of the Most High. His absolute supremacy, as the Creator and Lawgiver 
            of the universe, is necessarily implied in His ,eternal power and 
            Godhead;' and, while we may rest assured that it will ever be exercised 
            in accordance with His holiness, Justice, goodness, and truth, we 
            are utterly incompetent to determine what methods might be adopted 
            by His omniscient wisdom, either for the creation, or for the government 
            of His subjects, in the different parts of His universal empire. His 
            sovereignty was displayed in the work of Creation. He constituted 
            different orders of being,&mdash;inanimate, living, sentient, animal, intellectual, 
            moral, and responsible,&mdash;and endowed them with their several properties 
            and powers. But besides this, He brought them into being in different 
            ways; and the constitution, under which they were respectively placed, 
            was adapted to the method of their creation. Several classes, for 
            example, of intellectual, self-conscious, moral, and responsible, 
            creatures were brought into being, such as angels and men. But all 
            angels were brought into being individually, as our first parent was, 
            by the direct exercise of creative power; there was, in their case, 
            no birth, no hereditary descent, no paternal or filial relation, for 
            'they neither marry, nor are given in marriage;' whereas, in the creation 
            of man, God called into being a single pair, and made them the natural 
            root of the race which should spring from them; He placed them under 
            a family constitution, and called their descendants into being mediately 
            through them. There was a radical difference, therefore, between the 
            angelic hosts, and the human race, in respect to the position in which 
            individuals, belonging to each of them, were severally placed, and 
            the relations which they sustained to one another: in the one, every 
            individual was directly created,&mdash;connected with others by a common 
            nature, and placed in social relations with them,&mdash;but not derived 
            from any created being, and not dependent on any, as a child must 
            be on his parents;&mdash;in the other, every individual is created mediately,&mdash;brought 
            into being in a state of helpless infancy,&mdash;committed in trust for 
            years to parental care,&mdash;dependent for his life, and health, and comfort 
            on domestic aid, &mdash;endowed with faculties which are slowly developed, 
            under the influence of instruction and example,&mdash;and liable, therefore, 
            to be largely influenced, for good or evil, by the condition and character 
            of those with whom he is so necessarily and closely related. Such 
            was the radical difference between angels and men in respect to the 
            natural constitution under which they were severally placed,&mdash;and there 
            was a corresponding difference between them in respect to the law 
            which was imposed upon them, as moral and responsible beings. The 
            law, as prescribed to angels, was personal, and recognized only individual 
            responsibility; for however they might be connected by social relations, 
            or even subordinated, one rank to another, as 'principalities and 
            powers,' in a hierarchical government,&mdash;and however they might be liable, 
            in consequence, to the influence of each other's example,&mdash;they were 
            so far independent that each stood or fell for himself according to 
            his own conduct; and both those who 'kept,' and those who 'left,' 
            their first estate, did so by their own voluntary act, and not by 
            the act of any legal representative. Such a law was suitable to the 
            condition of moral and responsible beings created directly each by 
            himself, and probably like our first parent, in the full maturity 
            of his powers. But the law, as prescribed to man, was generic, and 
            recognized representative, as well as individual, responsibility: 
            for while, as it was the law of man's moral nature, it required&mdash;and 
            must always continue to require&mdash;personal obedience, on the part of 
            every individual as soon as he is capable of moral agency,&mdash;yet as 
            a revealed covenant of life, it was imposed on Adam as the representative 
            of his race, and made them dependent, for good or evil, on his conduct 
            as their federal head.<br>
            <br>
            Thoughtful men, considering the actual condition of the human race,&mdash;the 
            universal and constant prevalence of moral and physical evil,&mdash;the 
            certainty that every child born into the world will sin as soon as 
            he is capable of sinning,&mdash;the sufferings which are entailed upon him 
            by his birth,&mdash;and above all, the inevitable doom of death, have felt 
            that it is difficult, if not impossible, to account for these facts 
            occurring under the moral government of God, by referring them to 
            any mere personal law, such as implies only individual responsibility; 
            and that their minds were relieved, rather than oppressed, by being 
            told of a generic law, which was imposed on the father of the human 
            race as the legal representative of his posterity, and which warrants 
            them in regarding all their hereditary evils as judicial penalties 
            on account of his actual sin, and not as capricious or arbitrary inflections 
            proceeding from mere sovereignty. So strongly has this been felt, 
            that some, who have rejected the doctrine of federal representation 
            and imputed guilt, have been compelled to acknowledge that the actual 
            state of men, under the moral government of God, cannot be satisfactorily 
            accounted for except on the supposition of 'a forfeiture prior to 
            birth,' and to take refuge, as the only way of evading that doctrine, 
            in the theory of a state of pre-existence, in which every man sinned 
            and fell by his own personal disobedience. But if there be no scriptural 
            evidence for this theory, the actual condition of the race can only 
            be accounted for,&mdash;either by their relation to Adam as their natural 
            root,&mdash;or by their relation to him also as their legal representative,&mdash;or 
            to both these relations combined; for the latter is not exclusive, 
            but comprehensive, of the former. Had Adam been created merely as 
            the natural root of his posterity, and not constituted also their 
            legal representative, many evils might, or rather must, have flowed 
            from his sin, to all his descendants, in the way of mere natural consequence, 
            by reason of their hereditary connection with him; for his immediate 
            offspring were dependent on him, and their children again on them, 
            both for instruction and example; but some of the consequences of 
            his fall cannot be accounted for at all,&mdash;such as the universal and 
            irrevocable sentence of death,&mdash;and none of them can be accounted for 
            so satisfactorily,&mdash;except on the supposition that, besides being their 
            natural root, he was also their federal head. And this supposition 
            is in evident accordance with the analogy of the constitution of nature: 
            for if God manifested His sovereignty in creating angels individually 
            'without father, without mother, without descent,' and placing them 
            under a personal law, adapted to this constitution, and recognizing 
            only individual responsibility; and if He also manifested His sovereignty 
            in creating Adam as the root of a race which should spring from him, 
            and placing him, as their representative, under a generic law, adapted 
            to the family constitution, and recognizing representative as well 
            as individual agency,&mdash;in either case, the legal is adapted to the 
            natural constitution; and there is such an analogy between the two, 
            as serves to make the former credible, by reason of the undeniable 
            certainty of the latter.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Prop. VIII.</b> The breach of the Law in its covenant form by the 
            sin of our first parents, rendered it for ever impossible that either 
            they, or any of their descendants, should be justified on the ground 
            of their personal righteousness.<br>
            <br>
            If Adam was the legal representative and federal head of the race, 
            then all its members 'sinned in him,' as such, 'and fell with him 
            in his first transgression;' and they were involved along with him 
            in the guilt which he had incurred, and the condemnation which he 
            had deserved. This is necessarily implied in the fact, that, by sovereign 
            divine appointment, he acted <em>for </em>them, and was dealt with as <em>one</em> with 
            them, so that, according to his obedience or disobedience, they, as 
            well as he, should be accepted, or rejected, of God. The direct imputation 
            of the guilt of his first sin to all his descendants is necessarily 
            involved in the public character which he sustained as their representative; 
            and it is confirmed by the consideration that the penal consequences 
            of his transgression have been entailed on every generation of his 
            race. It does not imply that they committed the sin, or that they 
            were personally accessory to it; for the transgression, considered 
            as an actual sin, was his, and his only; but it was committed by him 
            as their legal representative, and the guilt of it is theirs simply 
            as they were represented by him. If representative, as distinct from 
            personal, agency, be admissible at all under the divine government,&mdash;if 
            it was expressly recognized in the first covenant of life,&mdash;and if 
            it be also recognized in the new and better covenant, the covenant 
            of grace,&mdash;then we reach the great general principle, that both righteousness, 
            and guilt, may be imputed to others on account of the obedience, or 
            disobedience, of those by whom they were severally represented. But 
            the principle does not imply, in either case, that the obedience was 
            personally rendered, or the sin actually committed, by those to whom 
            they are respectively imputed; for this were to overlook the fundamental 
            difference between personal, and representative, action.<br>
            <br>
            The direct imputation of the guilt of Adam's first sin to his descendants 
            is not necessarily exclusive of their personal guilt, as individuals. 
            The doctrine of mediate imputation, as taught by Placaeus and Stapfer, 
            is erroneous in its negative, rather than in its positive part,&mdash;in 
            what it denies, rather than in what it affirms. It denies the direct 
            imputation of the guilt of Adam's first sin, and thus virtually sets 
            aside his representative character; for if he acted as their representative, 
            his conduct must directly affect the condition of all who were related 
            to him, as such, under the covenant: but it affirms the imputation 
            of personal guilt, arising from inherent depravity or actual transgression, 
            and in this respect it teaches a solemn and momentous truth. For the 
            direct imputation of the guilt of Adam's first sin is not exclusive 
            of the additional charge of personal guilt in the case of every individual 
            of his race; and it i's of the utmost practical consequence that this 
            fact should be distinctly realized. For the doctrine which affirms 
            that 'God visits the iniquities of the fathers upon their children' 
            has often been perverted and abused, and even applied as an opiate 
            to soothe the conscience into a deep slumber, which may prove to be 
            the sleep of death. We find, for example, two of the prophets expostulating 
            with the Jews at Babylon on account of their sinful perversion of 
            that doctrine: 'What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning 
            the land of Israel, saying, the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and 
            the children's teeth are set on edge? As I live, saith the Lord God, 
            ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel. 
            Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the 
            soul of the son, is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.' This, 
            and the corresponding statement of Jeremiah,<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> have often been urged 
            as a scriptural argument against the doctrine of original sin; for 
            although there is an important difference between the relation which 
            Adam sustained to his posterity as the legal representative or covenant 
            head, and that which other parents bear to their children, yet the 
            general principle of individual responsibility which is so clearly 
            announced when it is said, 'The soul that sinneth, it shall die,' 
            is equally applicable, it has been said, to both cases, and is sufficient 
            to set aside the whole doctrine of hereditary guilt, and inherited 
            suffering. But neither of the prophets meant to deny that the Jews 
            in their capacity suffered in consequence, and on account, of the 
            sins of their fathers; what they meant to teach was, that they did 
            not suffer on account <em>only</em> of their fathers' sins,&mdash;that if their captivity 
            was brought on them, as they knew it had been, by the guilt of their 
            rulers and people in the land of Israel, it was prolonged by their 
            own continued impenitence and rebellion in Babylon, &mdash;and that as soon 
            as they repented and returned to the Lord with their whole heart, 
            He would remember no more against them either their fathers' sins 
            or their own, but 'receive them graciously, and love them freely.' 
            It is expressly said that they did suffer partly on account of their 
            fathers' sins;<sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and in the Decalogue itself, God had revealed Himself 
            as 'a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children 
            unto the third and fourth generation of them that <em>hate me</em>. '<sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But 
            they had not duly considered these last words; they imagined that 
            they suffered only because of their fathers' sins, and were unmindful 
            of their own; and the prophets were sent to remind them of both, that 
            by godly repentance they might be graciously restored. And it is deeply 
            interesting to mark that both are included in the confessions and 
            prayers of those among them who were suitably impressed and affected 
            by the prophet's message: 'Our fathers have sinned and are not, and 
            we have borne <em>their</em> iniquities.' 'The crown is fallen from our head: 
            woe unto us, that we have sinned.' 'Turn thou us unto Thee, 0 Lord! 
            and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.'<strong><sup> 4</sup></strong> A similar perversion 
            may be, and has been, made of the doctrine of original sin, as if 
            we suffered only on account of Adam's guilt, and not also on account 
            of our personal depravity and disobedience; and it is the more important 
            to counteract this fatal error, because it is chiefly by the consciousness 
            of his own inherent depravity, and the conviction of his actual transgressions, 
            that a sinner is first impressed, as by that which is nearest to him, 
            with a sense of his fallen and ruined condition, and is thereafter 
            led up, like David, to the consideration of his birth-sin, saying 
            first, 'I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before 
            me; against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in 
            Thy sight;' and then, but scarcely till then, 'Behold, I was shapen 
            in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.&quot;<strong><sup> 5</sup></strong><br>
            <br>
            There can scarcely be a greater or more dangerous error than to suppose 
            that the guilt of Adam's first sin is the only guilt with which we 
            are chargeable, or that it is exclusive of the personal guilt of individuals. 
            Such an idea could only be entertained on one, or other, of these 
            two suppositions,&mdash;either, that there is no law to which man is now 
            subject,&mdash;or, that there is no want of conformity to that law, and 
            no transgression of it. But the doctrine of Scripture, while it affirms 
            the direct imputation of the guilt of Adam's first transgression to 
            his posterity,&mdash;and of that <em>only</em>, for he was their representative with 
            reference merely to the one precept of the covenant,&mdash;affirms also 
            the transmission of hereditary depravity, arising from his loss of 
            original righteousness, and the corruption of his whole nature by 
            sin. It follows that, as sinners, neither Adam, nor any of his descendants, 
            could ever be justified on the ground of their personal obedience. 
            This is self-evident so far as their Justification depended on the 
            Law in its covenant form; for by breaking its precept, Adam forfeited 
            its promise, and incurred its penalty for himself, and for all whom 
            he represented; and this conclusion is so inevitable, that it can 
            only be evaded by denying, as some have been bold enough to deny, 
            his representative character altogether. It is equally certain that, 
            in so far as their Justification might be supposed to depend on the 
            Law as a permanent rule of duty, which continued to be binding on 
            him and all his descendants after the fall, they could not be justified 
            on the ground of their personal obedience to it; for, besides being 
            already subject to the penalty of the broken covenant, the corruption 
            of their nature which immediately ensued, made it certain that they 
            would individually contract fresh guilt, and be for ever incapable 
            of fulfilling the righteousness which the Law required. It is the 
            nature of the tree that determines the quality of its fruit, although 
            the quality of its fruit maybe an evidence of the nature of the tree. 
            But if all men are born in the image of their fallen parent,&mdash;if 'that 
            which is born of the flesh is flesh,' and if 'he that is in the flesh 
            cannot please God,'&mdash;it follows that 'no man since the fall can perfectly 
            keep the commandments of God, but doth daily break them in thought, 
            word, and deed;' and consequently that no man can be justified by 
            his personal obedience to that law, simply because 'the law is weak 
            through the flesh,' or fallen state of man,&mdash;and although it was originally 
            'ordained unto life,' is now 'found to be unto death.' There is something 
            that 'the law cannot do' (<em>to adunaton tou nomou</em>) &mdash;<strong><em>it cannot justify a sinner,</em></strong>&mdash; 'it condemns 
            sin in the flesh,'<strong><sup> 6</sup></strong> and is no longer 'the ministration of righteousness,' 
            but has become, through sin, 'the ministration of condemnation.' It 
            thus appears that, whether the Law be considered as the original covenant 
            of life, or as a permanent rule of duty, the breach of it rendered 
            it for ever impossible that any man should ever be justified on the 
            ground of his personal righteousness.<br>
            <br>
            This conclusion can only be evaded on one, or other, of these two 
            suppositions,&mdash;either that the law of God has been abrogated altogether, 
            so as to be no longer binding,&mdash;or that it has been so modified and 
            relaxed, as no longer to require perfect obedience, but to admit of 
            our being justified on easier terms. There is a third supposition, 
            indeed, but it is so untenable that no man with a conscience in his 
            breast can entertain or defend it, namely, that the law is still binding 
            as a rule of perfect obedience, and that men are able to fulfill it. 
            To those, if there be any, who are willing to take this ground, the 
            Lord Himself has said, 'This do, and thou shalt live.' But He also 
            said, 'The whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick;' 
            and that 'He came to call, not the righteous, but sinners to repentance.' 
            If there were any 'just men who need no repentance,' they would be 
            beyond the range of His commission, for 'He was not sent but to the 
            lost sheep of the house of Israel.' But discarding this supposition 
            as unworthy of a moment's notice in a world of universal ungodliness 
            and sin,&mdash;and looking only to the other alternatives, shall we say 
            that the law of God has been abrogated? Then all duty has been abolished 
            along with it,&mdash;our duty to God, our duty to men, our duty to ourselves; 
            sin has disappeared, and even the possibility of sin has been annihilated,&mdash;for 
            'where there is no law, there is no transgression;' we are no longer 
            the subjects of a moral government,&mdash;for where there is no law, there 
            can be no reward or punishment; and even the voice of conscience, 
            to which every man is compelled to listen, and by which he is made 
            to feel that 'he is a law to himself,' is a mere chimera or illusion. 
            Better far to be condemned by a righteous law, which, like God Himself, 
            is 'holy, and just, and good,' than to live in a lawless world, or 
            in universal anarchy!<br>
            <br>
            But if the law of God has not been, and never can be, entirely abrogated, 
            may it not be, and has it not been, modified and relaxed? This question 
            has been answered in the affirmative by two distinct parties,<em>&mdash;first,</em>            by some who hold that in the case of men who are unable, either from 
            their natural infirmity, or the corruption of their nature by sin, 
            to fulfill it, it must necessarily be accommodated to their weakness, 
            and cannot reasonably require perfect obedience; and <em>secondly</em>, by 
            others, who affirm that one object for which Christ came into the 
            world was to procure for us a new law, or easier terms of acceptance 
            with God, so as to supersede the perfect obedience which the original 
            law required, and to substitute for it imperfect obedience, if it 
            be only sincere, as the immediate ground of our Justification. These 
            are distinct positions, and they rest, in some respects, on different 
            grounds.<br>
            <br>
            Those who speak of the law of God being modified or relaxed, in accommodation 
            to the present infirm and depraved state of human nature, must be 
            held to proceed on a general principle, applicable to all orders of 
            moral and responsible creatures, angels as well as men, and amounting, 
            in substance, to this,&mdash;that wherever, and from whatever cause, they 
            have become depraved, their inability or unwillingness to render due 
            obedience, must relieve them, in proportion to the extent in which 
            they prevail, from the obligations of duty, and deprive God Himself 
            of the right to require it. From such a principle it would follow, 
            that His law can no longer be regarded as a fixed rule of righteousness, 
            or an invariable test of sin, but only as a sliding scale of duty, 
            whose requirements would become less in proportion as wickedness increased; 
            and that while holy angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect, 
            are 'not without law to God,' but bound to love and obey Him 'with 
            their whole hearts,' evil spirits and wicked men, whose minds are 
            filled with 'enmity against God,' would be relieved, by that very 
            enmity which makes them unable or unwilling to serve Him, from all 
            obligation to do so. That principle, consistently carried out to the 
            full extent of its legitimate application, leads inevitably to this 
            conclusion,&mdash;that the more wicked any creature becomes, the more must 
            the law be relaxed in accommodation to his inability to comply with 
            it, until he reaches a point at which he ceases to be a moral and 
            responsible agent at all. The law of God is not thus dependent on 
            the will of the creature, nor can its requirements be relaxed by the 
            increasing power of sin.<br>
            <br>
            Some, however, speak of the law of God as having been relaxed and 
            modified in consequence of the incarnation, sufferings, and death, 
            of Christ, so as no longer to require perfect obedience, but to accept 
            such as is imperfect, provided it be sincere. But here several questions 
            arise, to which distinct and definite answers may be reasonably expected 
            from those who make our eternal welfare to depend on our obedience 
            to this relaxed law. Where is it revealed in Scripture that Christ 
            became incarnate, suffered, and died upon the Cross,&mdash;not to fulfill 
            the law, but to alter it,&mdash;not to 'magnify the law and make it honourable,' 
            but to modify its demands, and supersede it by a new law with easier 
            conditions? Besides, what is that new law? What does it require? What 
            does it forbid? What are its sanctions? Is it possible, in the nature 
            of things, that any law can require less than perfect obedience, at 
            least, to itself? Why, then, is the obedience which is required said 
            to be imperfect? Is it imperfect with reference to the old law only, 
            or also to the new? If it be imperfect with reference to the former, 
            is there no sin in that imperfection? If it be imperfect with reference 
            even to the latter, how can it justify according to the rule of that 
            law? What is the sincerity which is connected with this imperfect 
            obedience? Is it more perfect than the obedience which springs from 
            it? Does the new law require any definite amount of obedience? And 
            if not, what is the graduated scale of duty, and what is its <em>minimum</em>? 
            If the original law required perfect obedience, could it be abrogated, 
            or even relaxed, otherwise than by God's authority? If it was not 
            abrogated, but republished, at Sinai, was it relaxed by Christ, when 
            He repeated it, saying, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all 
            thine heart, and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,&mdash;for on these 
            two commandments hang all the law and the prophets,' or when He expounded 
            its spiritual meaning in His sermon on the mount? Did He come to abrogate, 
            or relax, that eternal rule of righteousness, of which He said,&mdash;'I 
            am not come to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill,'&mdash;'Heaven 
            and earth shall pass away, but one jot or one tittle shall in no wise 
            pass from the law till all be fulfilled?' Or did His Apostles exceed 
            their commission when they said, 'Do we then make void the law through 
            faith? God forbid! yea, we establish the law'?<br>
            <br>
            It is true that the graces and duties of believers, although imperfect, 
            are 'acceptable to God,' but only <em>through Jesus Christ</em>,&mdash;' they are 
            the fruits of His Holy Spirit, but they are not in themselves, during 
            the present life, an adequate fulfillment of any law, whether old 
            or new; and they fall so far short of perfection, while they are so 
            defiled by remaining sin, that they are but as 'filthy rags' when 
            compared with the righteousness which the law requires. They cannot, 
            therefore, constitute a justifying righteousness, and must themselves 
            be accepted through the atoning sacrifice and perfect obedience of 
            Christ. So far from relying on them as the ground of their acceptance, 
            believers renounce them altogether, and repair continually 'to the 
            fountain which has been opened for sin and for uncleanness;' and it 
            is a sense of the imperfection of their obedience, arising from the 
            constant presence and remaining power of indwelling sin, that imbues 
            them, more and more as they advance in the divine life, with a 'broken 
            and a contrite spirit,' and deepens their consciousness of personal 
            unworthiness. For believing the divine law in all its perfection to 
            be still binding on them as a rule of duty, even when they have been 
            delivered from it as a covenant of works, and comparing its pure and 
            spiritual requirements with all the obedience which they have ever 
            been able to render, they are more and more deeply convinced of their 
            own sinfulness, and their absolute dependence on the grace of God, 
            and the righteousness of Christ. For, in the words of Archdeacon Hare, 
            'they who have ever had a deep spiritual conviction of sin, and of 
            their own sinfulness, retain that conviction to the end. Their growth 
            in holiness does not stifle it, but on the contrary renders it livelier 
            and more piercing; and thus, ascending step by step, we come to that 
            singular phenomenon, that the holiest men would be the most oppressed 
            by the conviction of their sinfulness were it not for their conviction 
            of Christ's righteousness, of which they become partakers through 
            faith, incorporating them as living members in His body; and through 
            which, being &quot;clothed upon&quot; by it, they may humbly hope 
            to stand in the presence of God.' This gracious frame of mind,&mdash;this 
            'broken and contrite spirit,'&mdash;this growing humility and self-abasement, 
            is one of the most characteristic marks of a true believer, and it 
            is fostered by an abiding sense of the spirituality and perfection 
            of the divine law; but could it exist, or would it not be supplanted 
            by a very different feeling, were that law supposed to be so relaxed 
            and modified, as to admit of our personal obedience to it being the 
            ground of our Justification in the sight of God?<br>
            <br>
            <b>Prop. IX.</b> The law of God, which is the rule of man's duty, 
            is also a revelation of God's eternal Justice and Holiness.<br>
            <br>
            Men talk lightly of His law being abrogated, modified, or relaxed, 
            not considering that, besides being an authoritative expression of 
            His supreme will, it is also a revelation of His essential nature, 
            as the Holy One and the Just, and the rule of His universal empire, 
            as the Governor and Judge of all. It is not the mere product of what 
            Cudworth called 'arbitrary will omnipotent;' His will is determined 
            by the infinite perfections of His character, and His character is 
            the real ultimate standard of 'eternal and immutable morality.' His 
            positive precepts may be resolved into the sovereignty of His will, 
            regulated in its exercise by His omniscient wisdom; and these may 
            be imposed, abrogated, or modified, according to His mere good pleasure; 
            but His moral law, while it is an expression of His will, is also 
            the image and reflection of His own moral perfection. God is 'holy, 
            and just, and good;' and therefore His law also 'is holy, and the 
            commandment holy, and just, and good.' 'Be ye holy,'&mdash;this is the voice 
            of His law, the expression of His supreme will: 'for I am holy, ' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup>            &mdash;this is the ground' or reason of that law, and it is derived from 
            His essential and unchangeable nature. 'The Lord is righteous in all 
            His ways, and holy in all His works;' and, therefore, 'the righteous 
            Lord loveth righteousness,' but 'He is of purer eyes than to behold 
            evil, and cannot look on iniquity. ' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup>, God is holy, and the law of 
            the universe is 'holiness to the Lord;' God is just, and the law of 
            the universe is 'justice;' God is true, and the law of the universe 
            is 'truth;' God is love, and the law of the universe is 'love.' It 
            reveals what He is, and what His creatures <em>ought </em>to be. Its precept 
            requires obedience as a <em>duty</em>, or as what is <em>due</em> to Him, and its threatening 
            declares punishment to be the <em>desert</em>, or the 'wages,' of sin. His 
            law can never require more or less, either of obedience or of punishment, 
            than is just and right; for 'a God of truth, and without iniquity, 
            just and right is He.' <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> To suppose that it ever required more than 
            was due, or threatened more than could be justly inflicted, would 
            be derogatory to all His attributes&mdash;His wisdom, His holiness, His 
            justice, His goodness, and His truth.<br>
            <br>
            It cannot, therefore, be modified or relaxed, since these perfections 
            are unchangeable; and it cannot be abrogated, unless His moral government 
            is to be abolished altogether.<br>
            <br>
            The Moral Law,&mdash;considered as the rule of His government, and also 
            as a revelation of His character,&mdash;must, still further, be viewed in 
            connection with what is declared to be His great ultimate end in all 
            His works,&mdash;the manifestation of His own glory by the actual exercise 
            of all His perfections. He reveals His character in the Law; but it 
            is the constant administration of that Law in His providence,&mdash;the 
            application of it even to the works of Grace and Redemption,&mdash;and the 
            final execution of it in the work of Judgment,&mdash;by which He will be 
            most signally glorified. He has made Himself known by a series of 
            divine revelations; but these are to be followed up by a series of 
            divine works, in which the unchangeable perfections of His nature, 
            on which His Law is founded, will be manifested in their actual exercise, 
            according to the tenor of that Law. The fulfillment of His promises, 
            and the execution of His threatenings, seem to be equally necessary 
            for this end. The non-fulfillment of the one, or the non-execution 
            of the other, would be derogatory to the honour of His Law, and to 
            the glory of His perfections, which it was designed to reveal. In the 
            exercise of His sovereignty, He may form a purpose of mercy towards 
            the guilty; but in carrying that purpose into effect, some provision 
            is necessary, such as His own omniscient wisdom alone could devise, 
            and His own infinite love suggest, for vindicating the majesty of 
            His Law, and securing the ends of His moral government. If punishment 
            was justly due to sin, and if it was ordained as a manifestation of 
            His eternal justice and holiness, it must either be inflicted on every 
            sinner with a view to that end, or the same end must be equally, or 
            better, accomplished in some other way.<br>
            <br>
            It thus appears that the Law, besides being an authoritative expression 
            of God's will, is also a revelation of His eternal justice and holiness,&mdash;that 
            it is the unchangeable rule of His moral government, and that, however 
            it may consist with a sovereign purpose of mercy towards sinners, 
            it can never be abrogated, modified, or relaxed, but must be executed 
            or fulfilled, in such a way as shall be manifest, in their actual 
            exercise, the same divine perfections which it was designed to reveal, 
            and secure the end of punishment itself&mdash;the glory of His great name.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Prop. X.</b> The doctrine of the Law is presupposed in that of 
            the Gospel, and the justifying righteousness which is required in 
            the one, is revealed in the other.<br>
            <br>
            That the doctrine of the Law is presupposed in that of the Gospel, 
            has been already shown; and that the justifying righteousness which 
            the Law requires has been revealed in the Gospel, will be proved hereafter, 
            in discussing the questions which still remain to be determined,&mdash;namely, 
            What that righteousness is, which is revealed as 'the righteousness 
            of God?' How, and by whom, it was wrought out? Why it is available 
            for our Justification? By what means we become partakers of it? And 
            by what agency it is effectually applied? In the meantime, the proposition 
            is merely stated for the purpose of indicating, in the first place, 
            the indissoluble connection, and yet the radical difference also, 
            between the Law and the Gospel; and, in the second place, the indispensable 
            necessity of a careful study of the one, in order to a right apprehension 
            of the other.<br>
