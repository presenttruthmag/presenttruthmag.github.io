              died in 1957, at the age of 83, after a long and distinguished career 
              as a teacher of theology at Calvin Theological Seminary, Grand Rapids, 
              Michigan. He attained world-wide fame as an author of the Reformed 
              faith. We here reproduce from his <em>Systematic Theology</em> a 
              portion of his comments on the law and gospel. &#8211; Ed.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
              Law and the Gospel in the Word of God</strong></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Churches of the Reformation 
              from the very beginning distinguished between the law and the gospel 
              as the two parts of the Word of God as a means of grace. This distinction 
              was not understood to be identical with that between the Old and 
              the New Testament, but was regarded as a distinction that applies 
              to both Testaments. There is law and gospel in the Old Testament, 
              and there is law and gospel in the New. The law comprises everything 
              in Scripture which is a revelation of God's will in the form of 
              command or prohibition, while the gospel embraces everything, whether 
              it be in the Old Testament or in the New, that pertains to the work 
              of reconciliation and that proclaims the seeking and redeeming love 
              of God in Christ Jesus. And each one of these two parts has its 
              own proper function in the economy of grace. The law seeks to awaken 
              in the heart of man contrition on account of sin, while the gospel 
              aims at the awakening of saving faith in Jesus Christ. The work 
              of the law is in a sense preparatory to that of the gospel. It deepens 
              the consciousness of sin and thus makes the sinner aware of the 
              need of redemption. Both are subservient to the same end, and both 
              are indispensable parts of the means of grace. This truth has not 
              always been sufficiently recognized.... </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The promises which man appropriates certainly impose upon him certain duties, and among them the duty to obey the law of God as a rule of life, but also carry with them the assurance that God will work in him &quot;both to will and to do.&quot; The consistent Dispensationalists of our day again represent the law and the gospel as absolute opposites. (They teach that)... Israel was under the law in the previous dispensation, but the Church of the present dispensation is under the gospel, and as such is free from the law. This means that the gospel is now the only means of salvation, and that the law does not now serve as such. Members of the Church need not concern themselves about its demands, since Christ has met all its requirements. They (the Dispensationalists) seem to forget that, while Christ bore the curse of the law, and met its demands as a condition of the covenant of works, He did not fulfill the law for them as a rule of life, to which man is subject in virtue of his creation, apart from any covenant arrangement.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Necessary 
                Distinctions Respecting the Law and the Gospel </strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              </font></p>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
            <p><strong>a.</strong> As was already said in the preceding, the distinction 
              between the law and the gospel is not the same as that between the 
              Old and the New Testament. Neither is it the same as that which 
              present day Dispensationalists make between the dispensation of 
              the law and the dispensation of the gospel. It is contrary to the 
              plain facts of Scripture to say that there is no gospel in the Old 
              Testament, or at least not in that part of the Old Testament that 
              covers the dispensation of the law. There is gospel in the maternal 
              promise, gospel in the ceremonial law, and gospel in many of the 
              Prophets, as Isa. 53 and 54; 55:1-3, 6-7; Jer. 31:33, 34; Ezek. 
              36:25-28. In fact, there is a gospel current running through the 
              whole of the Old Testament, which reaches its highest point in the 
              Messianic prophecies. And it is equally contrary to Scripture to 
              say that there is no law in the New Testament, or that the law does 
              not apply in the New Testament dispensation. Jesus taught the permanent 
              validity of the law, Matt. 5:17-19. Paul says that God provided 
              for it that the requirements of the law should be fulfilled in our 
              lives, Rom. 8:4, and holds his readers responsible for keeping the 
              law, Rom. 13:9. James assures his readers that he who transgresses 
              a single commandment of the law (and he mentions some of these), 
              is a transgressor of the law, Jas. 2:8-11. And John defines sin 
              as &quot;lawlessness,&quot; and says that this is the love of God, 
              that we keep His commandments, 1 John 3:4; 5:3.</p>
            <p><strong>b.</strong> It is possible to say that in some respects 
              the Christian is free from the law of God. The Bible does not always 
              speak of the law in the same sense. Sometimes it contemplates this 
              as the immutable expression of the nature and will of God, which 
              applies at all times and under all conditions. But it also refers 
              to it as it functions in the covenant of works, in which the gift 
              of eternal life was conditioned on its fulfillment. Man failed to 
              meet the condition, thereby also losing the ability to meet it, 
              and is now by nature under a sentence of condemnation. When Paul 
              draws a contrast between the law and the gospel, he is thinking 
              of this aspect of the law, the broken law of the covenant of works, 
              which can no more justify, but can only condemn the sinner. From 
              the law in this particular sense, both as a means for obtaining 
              eternal life and as a condemning power, believers are set free in 
              Christ, since He became a curse for them and also met the demands 
              of the covenant of works in their behalf. The law in that particular 
              sense and the gospel of free grace are mutually exclusive.</p>
            <p><strong>c. </strong>There is another sense, however, in which the 
              Christian is not free from the law. The situation is quite different 
              when we think of the law as the expression of man's natural obligations 
              to his God, the law as it is applied to man even apart from the 
              covenant of works. It is impossible to imagine any condition in 
              which man might be able to claim freedom from the law in that sense. 
              It is pure Antinomianism to maintain that Christ kept the law as 
              a rule of life for His people, so that they need not worry about 
              this any more. The law lays claim, and justly so, on the entire 
              life of man in all its aspects, including his relation to the gospel 
              of Jesus Christ. When God offers man the gospel, the law demands 
              that the latter shall accept this. Some would speak of this as the 
              law in the gospel, but this is hardly correct. The gospel itself 
              consists of promises and is no law; yet there is a demand of the 
              law in connection with the gospel. The law not only demands that 
              we accept the gospel and believe in Jesus Christ, but also that 
              we lead a life of gratitude in harmony with its requirements. </p>
            <p><strong><font size="4">The Threefold Use of the Law</font></strong></p>
            <p>It is customary in theology to distinguish a three-fold use of 
              the law.</p>
            <p><strong>The Three Defined.</strong> We distinguish: </p>
            <p><strong>a.</strong> <em>A usus politicos</em> or <em>civilis</em>. 
              The law serves the purpose of restraining sin and promoting righteousness. 
              Considered from this point of view, the law presupposes sin and 
              is necessary on account of sin. It serves the purpose of God's common 
              grace in the world at large. This means that from this point of 
              view it cannot be regarded as a means of grace in the technical 
              sense of the word.</p>
            <p><strong>b.</strong> A <em>usus elenchticus</em> or <em>pedagogicus</em>. 
              In this capacity the law serves the purpose of bringing man under 
              conviction of sin, and of making him conscious of his inability 
              to meet the demands of the law. In that way the law becomes his 
              tutor to lead him unto Christ, and thus becomes subservient to God's 
              gracious purpose of redemption.</p>
            <p><strong>c.</strong> A <em>usus didacticus</em> or <em>normativus</em>. 
              This is the so-called <em>tertius usus legis</em>, the third use 
              of the law. The law is a rule of life for believers, reminding them 
              of their duties and leading them in the way of life and salvation. 
              This third use of the law is denied by the Antinomians.</p>
