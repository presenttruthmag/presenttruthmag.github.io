              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few months ago this 
              editor was meeting with a group of evangelical preachers in an American 
              city. These men were concerned with the plague of Pentecostalism 
              and religious subjectivism that was sweeping the churches. They 
              were convinced that the challenge could only be met by a clear proclamation 
              of the objective gospel. A Reformed pastor declared, &quot;I have 
              preached the gospel in my church. I'm always talking about grace, 
              faith, and justification, but it does not make the impact it should. 
              What am I doing wrong?&quot;</font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When this editor asked 
              the preacher if he was just as diligent in arraigning his hearers 
              before the high claims of God's law and the judgment seat of Christ, 
              he admitted that he had allowed this phase of his Reformed heritage 
              to fall into disuse. &quot;Then you need look no further to answer 
              the lack of quickening power in your preaching,&quot; he was told.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Word of God is a 
              sharp, two-edged sword. The two cutting edges are law and gospel. 
              The gospel is good news to sinners, but it is a sheer waste of time 
              to try to comfort those who do not mourn &#8211; that is to say, 
              those who have not been made conscious of their sins by the proclamation 
              of God's law. Jesus said that we should not cast our pearls before 
              swine. Those who have not heard the law will not hear the gospel. 
              As C.F.W. Walther (<em>The Proper Distinction between the Law and 
              the Gospel</em>) well says, &quot;The law is for secure sinners, 
              and the gospel is for alarmed sinners.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Bunyan declared:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He that is 
                dark as touching the scope, intent and nature of the law, is also 
                dark as touching the scope, nature and glory of the gospel.... 
                I say, therefore, if thou wouldst know the authority and power 
                of the gospel, labor first to know the power and authority of 
                the law. For I am verily persuaded that the want of this one thing, 
                namely, the knowledge of the law, is the one cause why so many 
                are ignorant of the other.... Again, that man that doth not know 
                the nature of the law, that man doth not know the nature of sin; 
                and that man that knoweth not the nature of sin, will not regard 
                to know the nature of a Saviour.&mdash;John Bunyan, <em>The Doctrine 
                of Law and Grace Unfolded.</em></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The God of the Old Testament 
              is the God of law. He who is holiness personified demands a holiness 
              from man which is without variableness or shadow of turning. &quot;Obey 
              and live; disobey and die,&quot; is as fixed as the stars in their 
              courses. This inexorable demand of law provides the background to 
              the glory of the New Testament message of justification by grace, 
              on account of Christ, through faith. Take away that background, 
              and the message of grace becomes a meaningless platitude.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was a lively sense 
              of God's holiness and deep conviction of sin that prepared the Reformers 
              to appreciate the light on justification by faith. And in every 
              age where there has been a revival of genuine religion, men have 
              been brought by the law to cry out, &quot;How can a man be just 
              with God?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Protestantism has grown 
              fat and flabby. Luther warned that people would become secure and 
              lazy by the continual preaching of grace. To make matters worse, 
              Protestantism's reaction against legalism has made the church very 
              suspicious of law. In a recent article, Professor Gordon H. Clark 
              shows that even the word legalism has evolved a new meaning. He 
              writes:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The term legalism 
                in theology used to designate a theory of justification by works. 
                Liberals have now redefined it so as to exclude rules, laws and 
                obedience from moral living! Amorphous love replaces definite 
                commands. This enables the liberals to transfer the odium of legalism 
                in its historic sense to the evangelical view that is not subject 
                to such a criticism. Gordon H. Clark, &quot;Concerning Justification,&quot; 
                <em>Christianity Today</em>, March 16, 1973.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The church today is not 
              too concerned with the great Reformation article of justification 
              largely because the law has fallen into disuse. Justification is 
              a legal word, a law term. Dr. Strong defines it as being set right 
              before the law. The message of justification by faith is music to 
              those who take the demands of God's law seriously and realize that 
              &quot;the law must be fulfilled so that not a jot or tittle shall 
              be lost, otherwise man will be condemned without hope&quot; (<em>Luther's 
              Works</em> [Philadelphia: Muhlenberg Press; St. Louis: Concordia], 
              Vol. XXXI, pp. 348, 349). But this is a very permissive age. God 
              is too often viewed as an easy-going Benevolence who forgives sins 
              quite apart from upholding the integrity of His law. In an &quot;Introductory 
              Essay&quot; to Buchanan's masterful volume on <em>The Doctrine of 
              Justification</em> (reprinted by The Banner of Truth Trust, 1961), 
              Dr. J.1. Packer says:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Protestants 
                of today (whose habit it is to take pride in being modern) are 
                accordingly disinclined to take seriously the uniform biblical 
                insistence that God's dealing with man is regulated by law.... 
                Thus modern Protestantism really denies the validity of all the 
                forensic terms in which the Bible explains to us our relationship 
                with God.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The modern 
                Protestant, therefore, is willing to see man as a wandering child, 
                a lost prodigal needing to find a way home to his heavenly Father, 
                but, generally speaking, he is not willing to see him as a guilty 
                criminal arraigned before the Judge of all the earth. The Bible 
                doctrine of justification, however, is the answer to the question 
                of the convicted lawbreaker: how can I get right with God's law? 
                How can I be just with God? Those who refuse to see their situation 
                in these terms will not, therefore, take much interest in the 
                doctrine. Nobody can raise much interest in the answer to a question 
                which, so far as he is concerned, never arises. Thus modern Protestantism, 
                by its refusal to think of man's relationship with God in the 
                basic biblical terms, has knocked away the foundation of the gospel 
                of justification, making it seem simply irrelevant to man's basic 
                need.&mdash;pp. 5-6.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much of today's revivalistic 
              preaching is sentimental and subjective. As Professor Joel C. Gerlach 
              declares in <em>The Northwestern Lutheran:</em></font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The emphasis 
                is an old and familiar one. Accounts of personal encounters with 
                Christ are given top billing at the expense of the salvation message. 
                Experience is &quot;in,&quot; doctrine is &quot;out.&quot;. . 
                . Church history has a name for people who want to experience 
                Jesus without any doctrinal formulations, restricting creeds, 
                or code of Christian ethics. They are antinomians. They flourished 
                in Luther's day also.</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For several months <em>Present 
              Truth Magazine</em> has been doing a serious research of American 
              evangelical literature. The amount of antinomianism advocated in 
              much of it is scandalous. Big-name authors and some of the best-known 
              Christian publishing houses are filling the land with theories which 
              undermine the authority of God's law. If this were in the realm 
              of civil government, it would be called by its right name &#8211; 
              treason. <br>
              Dispensational theories, ideas on Christian love, baptism-of-the-Spirit 
              mentality and theories on grace &#8211; all are being used as if 
              they were substitutes for obedience to God's law. This is a desperately 
              permissive and lawless age, and surely society needs no encouragement 
              from the church to cast off the discipline of law.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In previous issues of 
              <em>Present Truth Magazine</em>, we have stated that Protestantism 
              is drowning in a sea of religious subjectivism. No one can successfully 
              challenge that observation. The cause is not neo-Pentecostalism 
              and emotional revivalism. They are symptoms, not causes. The cause 
              is rejection of God's law. If men reject the authority of an objective 
              rule of life, what other authority have they to fall back on but 
              their own subjective experiences?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In different ages the 
              church has had to grapple with great points of the faith and clarify 
              its theology. In the second century the great points of contention 
              were creation, the incarnation, and the resurrection. In the third 
              and fourth centuries they were the Trinity and the two natures of 
              Christ. In the tenth century the church grappled with the doctrine 
              of atonement. In the sixteenth century the evangelical church had 
              to clearly define the doctrine of justification by faith. The church 
              today is desperately in need of a clearly defined theology of law. 
              Witness the flood of Christian existentialism, social relativism, 
              and neo-orthodoxy that has deluged the churches. Their rejection 
              of legalism is commendable. But in their reaction they have undermined 
              the Christian's only absolute, objective authority. They leave us 
              with nothing to fall back on but our own human experiences. But 
              experientialism is the worst form of legalism!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The great issue today 
              is authority &#8211; the authority of God's Word versus the authority 
              of human experience. The battle lines are being drawn.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is in the context 
              of this conflict that the angels of the Apocalypse proclaim their 
              startling message:</font></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I saw another angel 
                fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach 
                unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, 
                and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and 
                give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship 
                Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains 
                of waters. And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is 
                fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations 
                drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the third 
                angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship 
                the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, 
                or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath 
                of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of His 
                indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone 
                in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the 
                Lamb.... Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that 
                keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. Rev. 14:6-10, 
                12.</font></p>
