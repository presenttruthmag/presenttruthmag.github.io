      F. Torrance was born in 1913. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh
      and received his D.Theol. at the University of
    Basel. He is a minister of the church of Scotland, and at present he is Professor
    of Christian Dogmatics in the University of Edinburgh and editor of the <em>Scottish
    Journal of Theology. </em>Professor Torrance is the author of numerous books
    and articles
    including <em>Conflict and Agreement in the Church.</em> Reprinted from Christianity

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="axtoroot.gif" alt="Confession laid the axe to the root" width=300 height=371 border="0" align="right">Justification means justification by Christ alone&nbsp;&#8212; that is the reference of the expressions <em>sola fide, sola gratia, sola scriptura, </em>used in Reformed theology. Justification means that we look exclusively to Christ, and therefore that we look away from ourselves altogether in order to live out of Him alone. That radical nature of justification is expressed and its radical consequences drawn by the <em>Scots Confession</em> in the words we cited earlier: &quot;We willingly spoil ourselves of all honor and glory of our own salvation and redemption, as we also do of our regeneration and sanctification.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is something that very badly needs to be reiterated today within the Churches of the Reformation. Justification by Christ alone means the rejection of all forms of self-justification and all forms of justification by anything or out of any source other than Jesus Christ. Let us consider what this means in several areas of doctrine and life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="4">Natural Goodness</font></b><BR>
    
      <br>
        <strong><font size="4">(a)</font></strong> At the Reformation Justification by the Grace of Christ alone was seen
      to set aside all natural goodness, and all works-righteousness; but this
      applies to all goodness, Christian goodness as well, that is, to &quot;sanctification&quot; as
      it came to be called. This is powerfully driven home by the <em>Scots Confession</em> in
      several articles, such as the twelfth and the fifteenth. All that we do is
      unworthy, so that we must fall down before you and unfeignedly confess
      that we are unprofitable servants&nbsp;&#8212; and it is precisely Justification
      by the free Grace of Christ alone that shows us that all that we are and
      have done
      even as believers is called in question. Justification by Grace alone remains
      the sole ground of the Christian life; we never advance beyond it, as if
      justification were only the beginning of a new self-righteousness, the beginning
      of a life of sanctification which is what we do in response to justification.
      Of course we are summoned to live out day by day what we already are in Christ
      through His self-consecration or sanctification, but sanctification is not
      what we do in addition to what God has done in justification. And yet that
      is the tendency of the <em>Westminster Catechisms</em>, where we have a return
      to the Roman notion of infused sanctification that has to be worked Out through
      strict obedience to legal precepts&nbsp;&#8212; hence the exposition of the
      Ten Commandments takes up the greater part of the Catechisms. But the <em>Scots
      Confession</em> laid
      the axe to the root of any such movement when it insisted that we have to
      spoil ourselves even of our own regeneration and sanctification as well as
      justification. What is &quot;axed&quot; so radically was the notion of &quot;co-redemption&quot; which
      in our day has again become so rampant, not only in the Roman Church, but
      in Liberal and Evangelical Protestantism, e.g., the emphasis upon existential
      decision as the means whereby we &quot;make real&quot; for ourselves the <em>kerygma</em> of the New Testament, which means that in the last resort
      our salvation depends upon our own personal or existential decision. That
      is the exact
      antithesis of the Reformed doctrine of election, which rests salvation upon
      the prior and objective decision of God in Christ. It is Justification by
      Grace alone that guards the Gospel from corruption by &quot;Evangelicals,&quot; &quot;Liberals,&quot; and
      Romans alike. </font> </p>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Natural Knowledge</font></B><BR>
    
      <br>
        <strong><font size="4">(b)</font></strong> Justification by the Grace of Christ alone calls in question not only
      all natural goodness but all <em>natural knowledge</em>. Natural knowledge
      is as much the work of the flesh as natural goodness; it is a work of the
      natural man.
      It is at this point that Karl Barth has made such an immense contribution
      to the Reformation. We cannot separate <em>knowing </em>and <em>being</em> for
      they belong to the same man, and it is the whole man, with his knowing and
      his acting,
      with the whole of his being, who is called in question by Justification.
      Justification puts us in the right and truth of God and therefore tells us
      that we are in untruth. Now, let it be clear that Justification by Grace
      alone does not mean that there is no natural goodness in man, but that man
      with his natural goodness is called in question. Jesus Christ died for the
      whole man (with his good and his evil) not for part of him, the evil part,
      but for the whole man. He died for all men, the good and the bad, and all
      alike come under the total judgment of His Death and Resurrection; all alike
      have to be born again in Him, and made new creatures. That is the radical
      nature of the Gospel, which becomes so clear to us when we communicate at
      the Holy Table in the Body and Blood of our Lord, for there we feel ashamed
      for our <em>whole being</em>, for our good as well as for our evil. But the
      same applies to our natural knowledge. Justification by the Grace of Christ
      alone, does
      not mean that there is no natural knowledge&mdash;what natural man is there who
      does not know something of God even if he holds it down in unrighteousness
      or turns the truth into a lie? But it does mean that the whole of that natural
      knowledge is called in question by Christ, who when He comes to us says: &quot;If
      any man will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow
      me.&quot; The
      whole man with his natural knowledge is there questioned down to the root
      of his being, for man is summoned to look away from all that he is and knows
      or thinks he knows to Christ who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no
      one goes to the Father but by Him. The theology of Barth can be described,
      then, as the application of Justification of the whole realm of man's life,
      to the realm of his knowing as well as the realm of his doing. In that, he
      has sought to follow through the radical consequences of the Reformation
      from which our forefathers resiled (<em>def:</em> recoiled, withdrew) led when they
      took refuge again, like the Romans, in the works of the natural man, for
      justification.<br>
    

    
    <br>
      <img src="crossupr.gif" alt="Cross and the meal" width=300 height=479 border="0" align="right">But if we are to take the <em>Scots Confession</em> seriously, then we have to apply
      this not only to natural knowledge but to <em>all</em> Christian knowledge; we have
      to learn to spoil ourselves of our own vaunted knowledge, we have to let
      our own theology be called into radical question, by Christ. If we translate
      the word &quot;justification&quot; by the word &quot;verification,&quot; we
      can see the startling relevance of this to modern theological and philosophical
      discussions. Justification by Grace alone tells us that verification of our
      faith or knowledge on any other grounds or out of any other source, than
      Jesus Christ, is to be set aside.</font>  
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justification has an <em>epistemological </em>as well as an ethical reference &mdash; epistemologically it insists that the only legitimate demonstration of Christian truth is that which is in accordance with its nature, which is Grace, and that to seek justification of it on any other ground is not only fundamentally false in itself but to falsify the Gospel at its very basis. But apart from the contemporary debate on &quot;verification,&quot; Justification means that at every point in our theological inquiry we have to let our knowledge, our theology, our formulations, our statements, be called into question by the very Christ toward whom they point, for He alone is the Truth. Justification means that our theological statements are of such a kind that they do not claim to have truth in themselves, for by their very nature they point away from themselves to Christ as the one Truth of God. Therefore whenever we claim that our theological statements or our formulations have their truth in themselves we are turning back into the way of self-justification.</font>  
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Out of sheer respect for the majesty of the Truth as it is revealed in the Holy Scriptures, we have to do our utmost to speak correctly and exactly about it&mdash;that is the meaning of orthodoxy and the way of humility&mdash;but when we have done all this, we have still to confess that we are unfaithful servants, that all our efforts fall far short of the truth. Far from seeking justification on the ground of our &quot;orthodoxy,&quot; we can only serve the Truth faithfully if we point away from ourselves and our statements to Christ Himself, and direct all eyes to Him alone. He who boasts of orthodoxy thus sins against Justification by Christ alone, for he justifies himself by appeal to his own beliefs or his own formulations of belief and thereby does despite to the Truth and Grace of Christ. Once a Church begins to boast of its &quot;orthodoxy&quot; it begins to fall from Grace.</font></p>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Tradition</font></B><BR>
  
      <br>
  
      <strong><font size="4">(c)</font></strong> Justification by the Grace of Christ alone calls in question <em>all</em> tradition.
The radical consequence of Justification was keenly felt in this direction at
the Reformation. Concentration upon the Word of God, the self-utterance of the
Truth, and the acknowledgment of its primacy, cut the strings of prejudice and
prejudgment and made clear the path of faith and obedience. Justification here
meant that faith is determined by the objective Word of God as its ultimate authority,
and so it was freed from the shackles of every lesser authority, for devotion
to the Truth of the Word (the whole Truth and nothing but the Truth) inculcated
a readiness to rethink all preconceptions and to put all traditional ideas to
the test face to face with the Word. In other words, sheer attachment to the
Word of God as the real object of knowledge meant detachment from all other sources
and norms of knowledge, and the demand that all traditional ideas and notions
had to be tested at the bar of the Word. That did not mean that tradition was
to be despised, but that it was to be subjected to the criticism of the Word
and the Spirit, and corrected through conformity to Jesus Christ. The Reformation
stood, therefore, for the supremacy of the Word over all tradition, and for theological
activity as the repentant rethinking of all tradition face to face with the Revelation
of God in Jesus Christ.<br>
  
<br>
But that applies no less to the Reformed and Evangelical tradition; to our
  Presbyterian tradition as well as to the Roman tradition. When we examine our
  own position today, it is astonishing to find how close we have come to the
  Roman view even in the Church of Scotland. How frequently, for example, we
  find that appeal is made to &quot;Christian instinct&quot; or to &quot;the
  mind of the Church&quot; over
  against the plain utterances of Holy Scripture, and often just at those places
  where the Word of God offends our will, opposes our habits, or cuts against
  the grain of our desire! And how massive is the effect of our several traditions
  upon the interpretations of the Bible! How easy it is to allow the Presbyterian
  tradition to determine our reading of the New Testament, especially when it
  is a question of justifying our tradition before the critique of others! There
  can be no doubt that every one of the great Churches of the Reformation&nbsp;&#8212; the
  Lutheran, the Anglican, and the Reformed&nbsp;&#8212; has developed its own masterful
  tradition, and that that tradition today exercises massive influence not only
  over its
  way of interpreting the Bible and formulating its doctrine but over the whole
  shape and direction of its life. Those who shut their eyes to this fact are
  precisely those who are most enslaved to the dominant power of tradition just
  because it has become an unconscious canon and norm of their thinking. It is
  high time we asked again whether the Word of God really does have free course
  amongst us and whether it is not after all bound and fettered by the traditions
  of men. The tragedy, apparently, is that the very structures of our Churches
  represent the fossilization of traditions that have grown up by practice and
  procedure, have become so hardened in self-justification that even the Word
  of God can hardly crack them open. There is scarcely a Church that claims to
  be <em>ecclesia reformata</em> that can truthfully claim to be <em>semper reformanda.</em></font>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Systems and Orders</font></B><BR>
    
    <br>
    
    <strong><font size="4">(d)</font></strong> Justification by Christ alone calls in question all <em>systems </em>and <em>orders</em>,
  and calls them in question because Jesus Christ alone is central and supreme
  in the one Church of God. In any true theological system, Justification is by
  reference to Christ alone, for conformity to Christ as the Truth of God for us
  is the one ultimate principle of unity. Likewise Justification in ecclesiastical
  order or polity ought to be through appeal to Christ alone. Our quarrel with
  the Church of Rome in doctrinal matters concerns the centrality of Jesus Christ,
  the primacy and supremacy of Christology which is so obscured and compromised
  by Roman doctrines of merit and tradition, and above all by Mariology. In our
  debate with the Church of England over questions of order, we are also concerned
  with the centrality of Christ, and the primacy of Christology&nbsp;&#8212; and therefore
  the doctrine of the Church as the Body of Christ is in the forefront. It is Justification
  by Christ alone that makes it so, for He alone is the ground and Head of the
  Church, and in Him alone is the Church's unity constituted and its order maintained.
  But for that very reason Justification by Christ alone disallows any appeal from
  one Church to another for recognition of its orders, as it also rebukes the self-justification
  of a Church in calling in question the orders of another Church. Justification
  by Christ alone means that we renounce the way of the flesh in seeking honor
  from men, or justification from one another; and therefore Justification by Christ
  alone means that in any movement for reconciliation between Churches, the question
  of the recognition of orders cannot have priority without radical betrayal of
  the Reformation, nay, without radical betrayal of Christ for He is thereby ousted
  from His place of centrality.<br>
    
<br>
    
It becomes more and more clear that in the ecumenical movement it is the doctrine of Justification by Christ alone that is at stake, and that it can just as easily be sinned against by those who shout loudest that they are upholding the Reformation tradition as by those who make no such boast. He is truest to the Reformation tradition who is always ready to subject it to the ruthless questioning of the Word of God.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Ministry and Worship</font></B><BR>

    <br>

    <strong><font size="4">(e)</font></strong> Nowhere does Justification by Christ alone have more radical consequences than in regard to the pastoral ministry. Justification by Christ is grounded upon His mighty act in which He took our place, substituting  Himself  for  us  under  the  divine judgment, and substituting Himself for us in the obedient response He rendered to God in worship and thanksgiving and praise. In Himself He has opened up a way to the Father, so that we may approach God solely through Him and on the ground of what He has done and is&mdash;therefore we pray in His Name, and whatever we do, we do in His Name before God. Thus the whole of our worship and ministry reposes upon the substitutionary work of Christ. Now the radical nature of that is apparent from the fact that through substituting Himself in our place there takes place a displacement of our humanity by the humanity of Christ&mdash;that is why Jesus insists that we can only follow Him by denying ourselves, by letting Him displace us from a place of centrality, and by letting Him take our place.<br>

<br>

At the Reformation this doctrine had immediate effect in the overthrow of Roman
sacerdotalism&nbsp;&#8212; Jesus Christ is our sole Priest. He is the one and
only Man who can mediate between us and God, so that we approach God solely through
the
mediation
of the Humanity of Jesus, through His incarnate Priesthood. When the Humanity
of Christ is depreciated or whenever it is obscured by the sheer majesty of His
Deity, then the need for some other human mediation creeps inhence in the Dark
and Middle Ages arose the need for a human priesthood to mediate between sinful
humanity and the exalted Christ, the majestic Judge and King. There was of course
no denial of the Deity of Christ by the Reformers&mdash;on the contrary, they restored
the purity of faith in Christ as God through overthrowing the accretions that
compromised it; but they also restored the place occupied in the New Testament
and the Early Church by the Humanity of Christ, as He who took our human nature
in order to be our Priest, as He who takes our side and is our Advocate before
the judgment of God, and who once and for all has wrought out atonement for us
in His sacrifice on the Cross, and therefore as He who eternally stands in for
us as our heavenly Mediator and High Priest.<br>

<br>

The Church on earth lives and acts only as it is directed by its heavenly Lord, and only in such a way that His Ministry is reflected in the midst of its ministry and worship. Therefore from first to last the worship and ministry of the Church on earth must be governed by the fact that Christ substitutes Himself in our place, and that our humanity with its own acts of worship, is displaced by His, so that we appear before God not in our own name, not in our own significance,  not in virtue of our own acts of confession, contrition, worship, and thanksgiving, but solely in the name of Christ and solely in virtue of what He has done in our name and on our behalf, and in our stead. Justification by Christ alone means that from first to last in the worship of God and in the ministry of the Gospel Christ Himself is central, and that we draw near in worship and service only through letting Him take our place. He only is Priest. He only represents humanity. He only has an offering with which to appear before God and with which God is well pleased. He only presents our prayers before God, and He only is our praise and thanksgiving and worship as we appear before the face of the Father. Nothing in our hands we bring&mdash;simply to His Cross we cling.<br>

<br>
But what has happened in Protestant worship and ministry? Is it not too often
the case that the whole life and worship of the congregation revolves round the
personality of the minister? He is the one who is in the center; he offers the
prayers of the congregation; he it is who mediates &quot;truth&quot; through his personality, and he it is who mediates between the people and God through conducting the worship entirely on his own. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the case of the popular minister where everything centers on him, and the whole life of the congregation is built round him. What is that but Protestant sacerdotalism, sacerdotalism which involves the displacement of the Humanity of Christ by the humanity of the minister, and the obscuring of the Person of Christ by the personality of the minister?  How  extraordinary  that  Protestantism should thus develop a new sacerdotalism, to be sure a psychological rather than a sacramental sacerdotalism, but a sacerdotalism nonetheless, in which it is the personality of the minister which both mediates the Word of God to man and mediates the worship of man to God! Protestant Churches are full of these psychological priests&quot; and
more and more they evolve a psychological cult and develop a form of psychological
counseling which displaces the truly pastoral ministry of Christ. How frequently,
for example, the minister's prayers are so crammed with his own personality (with
all its boring idiosyncrasies!) that the worshipper cannot get past him in order
to worship God in the name of Christ&mdash;but is forced to worship God in the name
of the minister! How frequently the sermon is not an exposition of the Word of
God but an exposition of the minister's own views on this or that subject! And
how frequently the whole life of the congregation is so built up on the personality
of the minister that when he goes the congregation all but collapses or dwindles
away!<br>

<br>

There can be no doubt that the whole concept of the ministry and of worship in our Reformed Churches needs to be brought back to the criticism of the Word of God in order that we may learn again the meaning of Justification by Christ alone in the midst of the Church's life and work. Jesus Christ must be given His rightful place by being set right in the center, as Head and Lord of the Church, as its sole Prophet and Priest and King, and that means in the midst of our preaching, in the basic notion of the ministerial office, in the fundamental mode of worship, and in the whole life of the congregation as the Body of Christ alone.</font><br>
