                                              "New Reformation Aborning?" This was the anxious and hopeful question raised by the editor of <em>Christianity Today</em>, October 26, 1973. Wrote he:</font>
              <blockquote>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It <em>is</em> a dark, depressing day. But the first Reformation sprang from just such a climate. There may be a new Reformation aborning somewhere, perhaps in some obscure place, that will erupt suddenly and dramatically. . . . Let's pray for a 'revival of true religion from its primitive sources.'</font></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primitive source for this new Reformation is the Word of God. The Word of God was communicated to us through Hebrew people. The Hebrews had a unique way of thinking and speaking. Our culture today is quite different, and even our way of thinking is sometimes quite different. Consequently we do not always appreciate the true force of words and concepts that are presented by those who wrote the Bible. We may read the words which these inspired men wrote, but we all tend to filter the words through the framework of our own culture, traditions and theological presuppositions. Sometimes we may have to scrape away the accretions of centuries so that the plain words of the Bible, in the framework in which these words were written, can speak to us in their primitive power.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In recent years a
                      number of scholars throughout the world have done some valuable
                      work in the area of Greek and Hebrew thought. They have drawn
                      attention to the striking contrast between the two modes of
                      thought. This is of great interest to every student of the
                      Bible. Even though the New Testament was written in Greek,
                      we must not suppose that it always expresses the typical forms
                      of Greek thought. We must remember that the writers (with the
                      possible exception of Luke) were Hebrews. The apostles' native
                      language was Aramaic, a Semitic language closely related to
                      Hebrew. But above all, the New Testament has its roots in the
                      Hebrew Old Testament and bears the unmistakable impress of
                      the Hebraic mind.</font> </p>

                      of the Contrast Between Greek and Hebrew Thought Patterns</font></b></font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us cite several
                  examples of the contrast that exists between the two modes
                  of thought:</font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4">1.
                      Concrete and Abstract.</font></strong> There seems to be
                      a general agreement among scholars that the Hebrew manner
                      of thinking and writing tends to be very concrete, while
                      the Greek tends to be more abstract. For instance, when
                      the apostle John says, &quot;Sin is the transgression of
                      the law&quot; (1 John 3:4), he writes in Greek, but the
                      thought form is Hebrew. To the Hebrew, righteousness and
                      sin were very concrete things. God had made known His will
                      and given His law. Righteousness meant conformity to the
                      law, and sin was nonconformity to the law. That is the
                      concrete framework out of which the Bible writers give
                      their message.</font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Greeks, on the
                  other hand, were more inclined to speak of sin in an abstract
                  way, and even though what they said might sometimes be true,
                  sin could mean a great variety of things to a variety of people.</font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4">2.
                      Dynamic and Static.</font></strong> In his book, <em>Hebrew
                      Thought Compared with Greek</em>,<sup><strong>1 </strong></sup>Thorliff Bowan says:</font>
              <ul>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Israelite
                thinking is to be characterized it is obvious first to call it
                dynamic, vigorous, passionate, and sometimes quite explosive
                in kind; corresponding Greek thinking is static, peaceful, moderate,
                and harmonious in kind. . . . To the person to whom the Greek
                kind of thinking occurs plainly as ideal, Hebrew thinking and
                its manner of expression appear exaggerated, immoderate, discordant
                and in bad taste. &mdash; p.25.</font>
              </ul>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the Hebrew, life
                  is activity and motion. Jehovah is the God who is constantly
                  acting in history.</font>
              <ul>
                <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the Israelite
                the true reality was action and movement, and the inactive and
                motionless was no reality at all. . . . Time is not an empty
                vanity, but a scene of meaningful action. &mdash; James Barr, <em>The
                Semantics of Biblical Language</em> (Oxford University Press,
                1961).</font>
              </ul>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="wholeman.gif" alt="The whole man" width=400 height=543 border="0" align="left">To the best Greek
                  philosophy, reality was that which was beyond activity and
                  motion, and was therefore something static and unchanging.</font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now let us see how
                  these two modes of thinking can affect our understanding of
                  the Bible. Take for example the word &quot;hear.&quot; Someone
                  has pointed out that when you think of the rabbi reading the
                  Scriptures, you must visualize him walking up and down in the
                  synagogue as he reads. On the other hand, you must picture
                  the Greek in a static, contemplative mood. When the Bible commands
                  us to &quot;hear&quot; the Word of the Lord, we must not get
                  the impression that we are simply being urged to make it the
                  subject of contemplative meditation. It means that we are to
                  responsively listen and act upon it. That is the Hebrew way
                  of thinking. When Peter preached the gospel in the home of
                  Cornelius, the record states, &quot;. . . the Holy Ghost fell
                  on all them which heard the Word.&quot; Acts 10:44. Obviously
                  the &quot;hearing&quot; involved more than submitting Peter's
                  message to contemplative consideration.</font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The same thing may
                  be said about &quot;faith.&quot; When the New Testament is
                  read in the context of the Old Testament and the Hebraic mind,
                  faith means much more than a nod of assent. Read Hebrews 11
                  for instance, and see how the apostle associates dynamic action
                  with faith. Believing (in the true sense) without action, faith
                  without works, is inconceivable; indeed, as James declares,
                  it is no faith at all. Faith cannot be reduced to a mere intellectual
                  process. As Luther declared, &quot;. . . it is a living, energetic,
                  active, mighty thing, this faith.&quot;</font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Hebrew concept
                  of &quot;remember&quot; is also to be understood dynamically.
                  When God saw the affliction of the Hebrews in Egypt, the Bible
                  says, &quot;God heard their groaning, and God remembered His
                  covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.&quot; Ex.
                  2:24. This certainly does not mean that the crisis of the Israelites
                  jogged God's memory. To &quot;remember&quot; actually means
                  that God was &quot;ready to take action.&quot; Of great Babylon,
                  it says in the Revelation, &quot;God hath remembered her iniquities.&quot; Rev.
                  18:5. Although this is written in Greek, it certainly conveys
                  the Hebrew sense of action. God acts against the sins of Babylon
                  and punishes her. When the Bible tells the penitent that God
                  will not remember his sins, it means that God will not take
                  action against him on account of them.</font>

              <blockquote>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I<font size="2">n</font><font size="2"> Greek thought man is seen as a duality, with an immortal soul imprisoned or confined in a mortal body; the two are only temporarily or accidentally related. In Hebrew thought the &quot;soul&quot; and &quot;flesh&quot; are not separable, but one is the outward and visible manifestation of the other. &mdash; Bowan,<em> op. cit</em>, p.12.</font></font></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It makes a lot of difference whether we think the body is a prison or a &quot;temple of the Holy Ghost.&quot; 1 Cor. 6:19. Socrates faced death calmly because of his faith in his own immortal soul. The apostles exhorted believers to put their faith in their life which was hidden in Christ (Col. 3:2-4), and they comforted the bereaved with the hope of the resurrection. Our anthropology and eschatology will not be Biblical if we read the Bible with Greek glasses.</font></p>
              <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>4. Relational and Ontological. </strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is very characteristic of the Bible to think about the value of things relationally, whereas the Greek mind tends to value a thing on the basis of its own inherent quality. Since the very gospel itself is at stake here, we will spend some time explaining the vital difference and looking at some concrete examples. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>a.</strong> Adam and Eve were commanded not to eat of a certain tree in the midst of the Garden, but when Eve examined the tree on the basis of its own inherent quality, she was convinced it was &quot;good for food.&quot; Gen. 3:6. This shows us that a thing does not have to be inherently &quot;poisonous&quot; to bring us the curse of death. In the case of the forbidden fruit, the only thing that made it sin was the Word of God. So it is not sufficient that we judge a thing or a deed by the sight of our eyes or by the hearing of our ears. We must first ask, &quot;How does it stand in relation to the Word of God?&quot;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
              </font>              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="goodnevl.gif" alt="The Tree of Knowledge" width=400 height=401 border="0" align="right">
              <p><strong>b. </strong>The same principle often holds true for
                things which are declared to be holy. The first time that the
                Bible declares anything to be holy is found in Genesis 2:1-3:
              
              <ul>
                <font size="2">Thus the heavens and the earth were finished,
                and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended His
                work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from
                all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day,
                and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all
                His work which God created and made. </font>
              </ul>
              <p>No quality in the day set it apart as holy any more than any
                special quality in the tree of knowledge set it apart as evil.
                The Hebrews were not commanded to regard the Sabbath as holy
                as if God had done some great work on that day. (In fact, Genesis
                2 says He did not work on the seventh day.) Then why was it holy,
                and why the command to &quot;keep it holy&quot;? Ex. 20:8. Simply
              because God's Word declared it holy.              
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The same thing may be said about the holy vessels of the tabernacle. They were made of clay, brass and various other material. The material itself was not holy. The vessels were holy because they were related to the tabernacle and to the service of the Lord. The Israelites were a holy people, not because they were ontologically better than Hittites or Egyptians, but because the covenant set them apart as belonging to God.</font> </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>c.</strong> This brings us to the Biblical concept of man's value. The Greeks looked at man ontologically and declared that he was valuable because, as they said, he had within him a spark of divinity&mdash;an innate, death-proof entity called the immortal soul. The Bible sees man as valuable because he stands related to God by creation and to Jesus Christ by redemption. In fact, man is considered precious, not because of some great value within, but by a great value without. He has been bought by the blood of Calvary's cross. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mephibosheth was a derelict cripple, yet he was precious to David because he was related to Jonathan. One woman thought so little of a child that she was willing to have Solomon divide him with the sword. To the other woman he was exceedingly precious because she was his mother. The preciousness was not in the child but in the eye of the mother. This illustrates how value is often determined relationally.</font>              
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>d.</strong> This relational principle is crucial when we come to the gospel of Jesus Christ. The righteousness of faith which is offered to us in the gospel is not a quality in us but is a righteousness which is credited to us by faith-union with Christ. The believer stands before God with perfect righteousness, but that perfection which the believer enjoys is not ontological but relational. God deals with the believer on a relational basis, and there is no other way he can stand approved at God's judgment seat.
              </font>
              </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p>When we look to the cross on which the Son of God
                            died, we may see how God treats a man according to
                            his relational position rather than his personal
                            qualifications. Jesus Christ was righteousness personified,
                            but when He identified Himself with sinners, God
                            treated Him as a sinner. It is now our privilege
                            to identify ourselves with Christ and be treated
                            as righteous. It is not who we are, but who we are
                            related to, that determines our eternal destiny.
                            ..... he that receiveth a righteous man in the name
                            of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's
                            reward.&quot; Matt. 10:41. &quot;For as by one man's
                            disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience
                            of One shall many be made righteous.&quot; Rom. 5:19.

                          of looking to the coming of Christ and the resurrection,
                          it placed its hope in the continuation of life after
                          death by virtue of the immortal soul. Men began to
                          hope in their going rather than in Christ's coming.
              <p>So too, the Biblical teaching on &quot;flesh&quot; and
                          spirit was read with the glasses of Greek dualism.
                          Men thought that &quot;flesh&quot; referred to the
                          activities of man's &quot;lower&quot; nature&nbsp;&#8212; things
                          such as eating, drinking and sexuality. And &quot;spirit&quot; was
                          taken to mean the activities of man's &quot;higher&quot; nature&mdash;things
                          such as meditation, prayer and other religious activities.
                          In this framework celibacy was considered better than
                          marriage, fasting better than eating, and pious meditation
                          in a monastery better than secular work. Men became
                          so &quot;heavenly&quot; minded that they were of little
                          earthly good.
              <p><strong>4.</strong> Above all, the church lost the
                          heart of the gospel when it lost the relational way
                          of Biblical thinking. Theologians put on their Greek
                          glasses and saw the whole process of salvation only
                          in an ontological way. When they read the word &quot;grace,&quot; they
                          understood it to mean a quality which God puts within
                          men's hearts instead of simply taking it to mean a
                          quality in the heart of God. When they read &quot;the
                          righteousness of faith,&quot; they understood it to
                          mean the renewal of the heart by the Holy Spirit instead
                          of the vicarious obedience of Jesus Christ. &quot;Justify&quot; no
                          longer meant &quot;to declare righteous&quot; and was
                          read as if it meant &quot;to make righteous.&quot; &quot;Impute&quot; became &quot;infuse.&quot; The
                          great relational truths of the gospel were converted
                          into ontological concepts, and men groveled in their
              own religious internalism.

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Reformation of the sixteenth century was, in many respects, a revolt against the Aristotelian and Platonic thought patterns which had such a strangle hold on the church. The Reformers partially, if not fully, recovered the Hebraic, or Biblical, way of thinking. This was especially true of Luther, who unleashed a terrific assault against medieval scholasticism. The thinking of the Reformers was more Hebraic than Greek in the following ways: </font>              </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. </strong>Anselm had done some great work on the doctrine of the atonement in the eleventh century. He argued for the necessity of the atonement on the grounds of the holiness of God's nature, and in this made a great contribution. But he still left the doctrine largely in the realm of the abstract. The Reformers were the first men since the apostles to concretely relate the atonement to the law of God. Says Dr. George Smeaton:</font></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">A further explanation of truth was reserved for the Reformation, by penetrating more deeply into the nature of the divine Law than was ever discovered by the great scholastic. What his theory wanted, indeed, was a full recognition of the claims of the divine law, and of the atonement as a satisfaction of these claims in all their breadth and extent....Previous theories wanted a full recognition of the claims of the divine law, and of the atonement as a satisfaction of these claims in all their extent; and this became the element in which the theology of the Reformation moved, and by which all other truth was coloured. . . . Their main position, to which they were conducted by deeper views of the extent of the law and of its unbending claims, was that Christ's satisfaction was perfectly identical with that which men should themselves have rendered; and in the atonement they read off the unalterable claims of the divine law. &mdash; George Smeaton, <em>The Atonement According to Christ and His Apostles.</em> Republished by Sovereign Grace Publishers, Grand Rapids, Michigan. </font></font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2.</strong> Luther's concept of &quot;flesh&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot; was a brilliant recovery of the wholistic Hebraic way of thinking. He understood &quot;flesh&quot; to mean the whole man without the Spirit, and &quot;spirit&quot; to mean the whole man who is guided by the Spirit. Thus the most devout religious activity could be called &quot;flesh,&quot; and the most corporeal or secular activity could be called &quot;spirit.&quot; This exploded the whole system of medieval piety. </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p>The Reformer did not have any time for the medieval
                            concept of immortality. Says Paul Althaus in <em>The
                            Theology of Martin Luther:</em>
              <ul>
                            <font size="2">The hope of the early church centered
                            on the resurrection on the Last Day. It is this which
                            first calls the dead into eternal life (1 Cor. 15;
                            Phil. 3:20f.). This resurrection happens to the total
                            man and not only to the body. Paul speaks of the
                            resurrection not of &quot;the body&quot; but of &quot;the
                            dead.&quot; This understanding of the resurrection
                            implicitly understands death as also affecting the
                            total man. . &mdash; Thus the original biblical concepts
                            have been replaced by ideas from Hellenistic Gnostic
                            dualism. The New Testament idea of the resurrection
                            which affects the total man has had to give way to
                            the immortality of the soul. The Last Day also loses
                            its significance, for souls have received all that
                            is decisively important long before this. Eschatological
                            tension is no longer strongly directed to the day
                            of Jesus' coming. The difference between this and
                            the hope of the New Testament is very great.</font><br>
                              <p><font size="2">. . . the decisive New Testament
                                  insights reappear in Luther and once again
                                  become the dominating elements in his thinking.

                          <p>4. Above all, the Reformation was a recovery of
                            the heart of the gospel, which proclaims salvation
                            through a relational righteousness that is accepted
                            by faith. Said Luther:
                          <ul>
                            <font size="2">Christian righteousness is not a righteousness
                            that is within us and clings to us, as a quality
                            or virtue does, that is, something that is found
                            to be part of us or something that is felt by us.
                            But it is a foreign righteousness entirely outside
                            us, namely, Christ Himself.. . &mdash; <em>What Luther
                            Says</em>, ed. Ewald M. Plass, Vol.3, p.1230. </font>

                            For God has made a different arrangement. Our Adam

                          <p>The same humanistic influences that worked in the
                            early church have made their mark on the Protestant
                            movement. Instead of going on from the Reformers
                            to a more complete recovery of Biblical thought,
                            there has been a going back. We must not underestimate
                            the influence of Greek philosophy on Christian theology.
                            For instance, Bowan maintains that &quot;for centuries
                            in English universities there has been a living Platonic
                            philosophical tradition which has also had a great
                            influence upon English theology.&quot; &mdash; Bowan, <em>op.
                            cit,</em> p.19.
                          <p>The evangelical wing of the church is often just
                            as guilty of reading the Bible with Grecian glasses
                            as the liberals. In fact, sometimes the liberal scholars
                            are more aware of the problem and are candid enough
                            to admit it. Sometimes we evangelicals are so obscurantist
                            that we imagine it would be blasphemy even to question
                            any of our Grecian theology.
                          <p>If we are ever going to participate in a new Reformation,
                            we will have to take off our Greek glasses and read
                            the Bible in its Hebraic framework&mdash;concrete, dynamic,
                            wholistic and relational. In that day will God fulfill
