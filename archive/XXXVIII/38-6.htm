In his book, </font></i><font size="2">The Unsettling of America: Culture and Agriculture <i>(San Francisco, Sierra Club Books, 1977), Wendell Berry says some challenging and disturbing things about the results of a body/soul dualism on American culture and agriculture.

The concept of health is rooted in the concept of wholeness. To be healthy is to be whole. The word <em>health</em> belongs to a family of words, a listing of which will suggest how far the consideration of health must carry us:<em> heal, whole, wholesome, hale, hallow, holy. </em>And so it is possible to give a definition to <em>health</em> that is positive and far more elaborate than that given to it by most medical doctors and the officers of public health. . . .<br>
  
<br>
  
It is therefore absurd to approach the subject of health piecemeal with a departmentalized band of specialists. A medical doctor uninterested in nutrition, in agriculture, in the wholesomeness of mind and spirit is as absurd as a farmer who is uninterested in health. Our fragmentation of this subject cannot be our cure, because it is our disease. The body cannot be whole alone. Persons cannot be whole alone. It is wrong to think that bodily health is compatible with spiritual confusion or cultural disorder, or with polluted air and water or impoverished soil. Intellectually, we know that these patterns of interdependence exist; we understand them better now perhaps than we ever have before; yet modern social and cultural patterns contradict them and make it difficult or impossible to honor them in practice.<br>
    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    
To try to heal the body alone is to collaborate in the destruction of the body. Healing is impossible in loneliness; it is the opposite of loneliness. Conviviality is healing. To be healed we must come with all the other creatures to the feast of Creation. . . . The fatal sickness is despair, a wound that cannot be healed because it is encapsulated in loneliness, surrounded by speechlessness. Past the scale of the human, our works do not liberate us&mdash; they confine us. They cut off access to the wilderness of Creation where we must go to be reborn&mdash;to receive the awareness, at once humbling and exhilarating, grievous and joyful, that we are a part of Creation, one with all that we live from and all that, in turn, lives from us. They destroy the communal rites of passage that turn us toward the wilderness and bring us home again.</font></p>

      <br>
          
Perhaps the fundamental damage of the specialist system&mdash; the damage from which all other damages issue&mdash; has been the isolation of the body. At some point we began to assume that the life of the body would be the business of grocers and medical doctors, who need take no interest in the spirit, whereas the life of the spirit would be the business of churches, which would have at best only a negative interest in the body. In the same way we began to see nothing wrong with putting the body&mdash; most often somebody else's body, but frequently our own&mdash;to a task that insulted the mind and demeaned the spirit. And we began to find it easier than ever to prefer our own bodies to the bodies of other creatures and to abuse, exploit, and otherwise hold in contempt those other bodies for the greater good or comfort of our own.<br>
          
<br>
          
The isolation of the body sets it into direct conflict with everything else in Creation. It gives it a value that is destructive of every other value. That this has happened is paradoxical, for the body was set apart from the soul in order that the soul should triumph over the body. . . .</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it is clear to anyone who looks carefully at any crowd that we are wasting our bodies exactly as we are wasting our land. Our bodies are fat, weak, joyless, sickly, ugly, the virtual prey of the manufacturers of medicine and cosmetics. Our bodies have become marginal; they are growing useless like our &quot;marginal&quot; land because we have less and less use for them. After the games and idle flourishes of modern youth, we use them only as shipping cartons to transport our brains and our few employable muscles back and forth to work.<br>
  
<br>
  <img src="38pg29d.gif" alt="" width=394 height=303 border="0" align="right">As for our spirits, they seem more and more to comfort themselves by buying things. No longer in need of the exalted drama of grief and joy, they feed now on little shocks of greed, scandal, and violence. For many of the churchly, the life of the spirit is reduced to a dull preoccupation with getting to Heaven. At best, the world is no more than an embarrassment and a trial to the spirit, which is otherwise radically separated from it. The true lover of God must not be burdened with any care or respect for His works. While the body goes about its business of destroying the earth, the soul is supposed to lie back and wait for Sunday, keeping itself free of earthly contaminants. While the body exploits other bodies, the soul stands aloof, free from sin, crying to the gawking bystanders: &quot;I am not enjoying it!&quot; As far as this sort of &quot;religion&quot; is concerned, the body is no more than the lusterless container of the soul, a mere &quot;package,&quot; that will nevertheless light up in eternity, forever cool and shiny as a neon cross. This separation of the soul from the body and from the world is no disease of the fringe, no aberration, but a fracture that runs through the mentality of institutional religion <strong>like a geologic fault. </strong>And this rift in the mentality of religion continues to characterize the modern mind, no matter how secular or worldly it becomes.<br>
  
<br>
  
But I have not stated my point exactly enough. This rift is not <em>like</em> a geologic fault; it <em>is</em> a geologic fault. It is a flaw in the mind that runs inevitably into the earth. Thought affects or afflicts substance neither by intention nor by accident, but because, occurring in the Creation that is unified and whole, it must; there is no help for it.<br>
  
<br>
  The soul, in its loneliness, hopes only for &quot;salvation.&quot; And yet what is the burden of the Bible if not a sense of the mutuality of influence, rising out of an essential unity, among soul and body and community and world? These are all the works of God, and it is therefore the work of virtue to make or restore harmony among them. The world is certainly thought of as a place of spiritual trial, but i~ is also the confluence of soul and body, word and flesh, where thoughts must become deeds, where goodness is to be enacted. This is the great meeting place, the narrow passage where spirit and flesh, word and world, pass into each other. The Bible's aim, as I read it, is not the freeing of the spirit from the world. It is the handbook of their interaction. It says that they cannot be divided; that their mutuality, their unity, is inescapable; that they are not reconciled in division, but in harmony. What else can be meant by the resurrection of the body? The body should be &quot;filled with light,&quot; perfected in understanding. And so everywhere there is the sense of consequence, fear and desire, grief and joy. What is desirable is repeatedly defined in the tensions of the sense of consequence. False prophets are to be known &quot;by their fruits.&quot; We are to treat others as we would be treated; thought is thus barred from any easy escape into aspiration or ideal, is turned around and forced into action. The following verses from Proverbs are not very likely the original work of a philosopher-king; they are overheard from generations of agrarian grandparents whose experience taught them that spiritual qualities become earthly events:</font>  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;<br>
            
And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, <br>
      and the stone wall thereof was broken down.<br>
            
Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.<br>
            
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:<br>
            
So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man. . . .</font>  </p>
  </blockquote>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The so-called identity crisis, for instance, is a disease that seems to have become prevalent after the disconnection of body and soul and the other piecemealings of the modern period. One's &quot;identity&quot; is apparently the immaterial part of one's being&mdash;also known as psyche, soul, spirit, self, mind, etc. The dividing of this principle from the body and from any particular worldly locality would seem reason enough for a crisis. Treatment, it might be thought, would logically consist in the restoration of these connections: the lost identity would find itself by recognizing physical landmarks, by connecting itself responsibly to practical circumstances; it would learn to stay put in the body to which it belongs and in the place to which preference or history or accident has brought it; it would, in short, find itself in finding its work. But &quot;finding yourself,&quot; the pseudo-ritual by which the identity crisis is supposed to be resolved, makes use of no such immediate references. Leaving aside the obvious, and ancient, realities of doubt and self-doubt, as well as the authentic madness that is often the result of cultural disintegration, it seems likely that the identity crisis has become a sort of social myth, a genre of self-indulgence. It can be an excuse for irresponsibility or a fashionable mode of self-dramatization. It is the easiest form of self-flattery&mdash;a way to construe procrastination as a virtue&mdash;based on the romantic assumption that &quot;who I really am&quot; is better in some fundamental way than the available evidence proves.<br>

  <br>
  The fashionable cure for this condition, if I understand the lore of it correctly, has nothing to do with the assumption of responsibilities or the renewal of connections. The cure is &quot;autonomy,&quot; another mythical condition, suggesting that the self can be self-determining and independent without regard for any determining circumstance or any of the obvious dependences. This seems little more than a jargon term for indifference to the opinions and feelings of other people. There is, in practice, no such thing as autonomy. Practically, there is only a distinction between responsible and irresponsible dependence. Inevitably failing this impossible standard of autonomy, the modern self-seeker becomes a tourist of cures, submitting his quest to the guidance of one guru after another. The &quot;cure&quot; thus preserves the disease.<br>

  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
It is not surprising that this strange disease of the spirit&mdash;the self's search for the self&mdash;should have its counterpart in an anguish of the body. One of the commonplaces of modern experience is dissatisfaction with the body&mdash;not as one has allowed it to become, but as it naturally is. The hardship is perhaps greater here because the body, unlike the self, is substantial and cannot be supposed to be inherently better than it was born to be. It can only be thought inherently worse than it <em>ought</em> to be. For the appropriate standard for the body&mdash;that is, health&mdash;has been replaced, not even by another standard, but by very exclusive physical <em>models</em>. The concept of &quot;model&quot; here conforms very closely to the model of the scientists and planners: it is an exclusive, narrowly defined ideal which affects destructively whatever it does not include.<br>

<br>
Thus our young people are offered the ideal of health only by what they know to be lip service. What they are made to feel forcibly, and to measure themselves by, is the exclusive desirability of a certain physical model. Girls are taught to want to be leggy, slender, large-breasted, curly-haired, unimposingly beautiful. Boys are instructed to be &quot;athletic&quot; in build, tall but not too tall, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, narrow-hipped, square-jawed, straight-nosed, not bald, unimposingly handsome. Both sexes should look what passes for &quot;sexy&quot; in a bathing suit. Neither, above all, should look old.<br>

<br>
Though many people, in health, are beautiful, very few resemble these models. The result is widespread suffering that does immeasurable damage both to individual persons and to the society as a whole. The result is another absurd pseudo-ritual, &quot;accepting one's body,&quot; which may take years or may be the distraction of a lifetime. Woe to the man who is short or skinny or bald. Woe to the man with a big nose. Woe, above all, to the woman with small breasts or a muscular body or strong features; Homer and Solomon might have thought her beautiful, but she will see her own beauty only by a difficult rebellion. And like the crisis of identity, this crisis of the body brings a helpless dependence on cures. One spends one's life dressing and &quot;making up&quot; to compensate for one's supposed deficiencies. Again, the cure preserves the 'disease. And the putative healer is the guru of style and beauty aid. The sufferer is by definition a customer.</font><br>
