      <FONT SIZE="6" FACE="Arial Black" COLOR="Maroon">New Catholic Impetus to Ecumenism</FONT>      <p> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="pope_paul.gif" alt="Pope Paul" width=382 height=594 border=0 align="right">Religious observers are noticing with surprise the increased Roman Catholic initiatives in the ecumenical field. In harmony with recent Vatican policies to foster ecumenical accord, a growing number of statements and actions are being made these days. This plan stems from the Vatican II Council decisions to eliminate &quot;the scandal of Christian disunity&quot; and foster and finally achieve the unity among His people for which Christ prayed. </font> </p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notable among the evidences of Catholic activity in this direction are the following pronouncements and actions:</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pope Paul: In 1972 the pope proclaimed that the worldwide cause of Christian unity is being menaced by divisions within the Roman Catholic Church. He told a delegation of the Russian Orthodox patriarchate of Moscow that Catholic and Orthodox Christians share a common faith which they are obliged to preserve, understand and transmit to future generations.
      <p>Cardinal Jan Willebrands: President of the Vatican Secretariat for Christian Unity, Cardinal Willebrands pronounced that he saw a number of significant developments in progress toward Christian unity during 1971. He cited the following areas of contact and exchange which gave reason for his optimistic comment:</p>
      </font>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; Exchange of correspondence between Pope Paul and Greek Orthodox Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople, which stressed the need for the growth of a truly brotherly attitude in both communities so that one day they might &quot;communicate together with the same chalice of the Lord.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; Official visits to the Orthodox churches of Greece and Crete, as well as attendance at the synod of the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; Completion of the 
          Catholic-Lutheran joint commission report on the theme of &quot;The 
          Gospel and the Church.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; First series of Catholic-Methodist 
          conversations held on the problems of Christian spirituality, the Eucharist, 
          matrimony and the Christian family.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; Conversations with 
          the World Reform Alliance on the subject of &quot;The Presence of Christ 
          in the Church and in the World.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; The substantial agreement 
          regarding the doctrine of the Eucharist reached by the International 
          Joint Commission of Catholics and Anglicans.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Archbishop Michael Ramsay: 
        The Franciscan Friars of the Atonement presented the Christian Unity Award 
        to Archbishop Ramsay, primate of all England, titular head of the Anglican 
        Communion at Graymoor. Archbishop Ramsay had just returned from his United 
        States visit, during which he preached in St. Patrick's Roman Catholic 
        Cathedral in New York. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Eugene Carson Blake: A historic ecumenical 
          service was held February 20, 1972 in St. Patrick's Cathedral in Sydney, 
          Australia, when world church leaders gathered to inaugurate the Year of 
          Renewal. Dr. Carson Blake, the General Secretary of the World Council 
          of Churches, was the preacher. Among heads of churches present at the 
          service were Bishop Karekin Sarkissian of the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox 
          Church, Lebanon; Dr. Frank Woods, Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne; and 
          Right Rev. William Morgan, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in 
          Victoria. At the Service of Renewal a new Eucharistic prayer was used 
          for the first time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Melbourne Parish Action Commences: 
        The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne, Australia, has launched its 
        parish action weeks for each of its churches. Ecumenical services are 
        included in the program. The first parish to begin the &quot;Action Week&quot; 
        was the Holy Name Parish, East Preston, whose ecumenical service was held 
        before a combined congregation of Catholic, Anglican, Church of Christ, 
        Methodist, Presbyterian and Salvation Army personnel. The Catholic Advocate 
        of February 17 reports the meeting thus: &quot;Accompanied by music from 
        the Salvation Army Band, all the churches represented joined in a dramatized 
        farce on ecumenism &#8211; showing how they could (after a long history 
        of ecumenical co-operation in the East Preston area) laugh at the many 
        small things that were once a great stumbling block to unity.&quot;</font></p>
