      <FONT SIZE="6" FACE="Arial Black" COLOR="Maroon">Editorial: Protest or Perish</FONT>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lately I have been 
        looking through a variety of &#8220;Protestant&#8221; journals. It is 
        amazing how they are almost totally preoccupied with religious experience. 
        Everyone seems to be lusting after &#8220;a satisfying Christian experience&#8221; 
        and making that the central point of concern. Says one of these publications: 
        &#8220;The gospel is about an experience of Jesus Christ in your own heart.&#8221; 
        Another declares: &#8220;Righteousness by faith is simply a real, vibrant 
        experience with the Lord.&#8221; Another proclaims:&#8221;The gospel is 
        about a mighty inward change of the heart and an experience of being baptized 
        in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <p><font size="3">Nothing could be further from the truth. The gospel that 
        was proclaimed by the apostles and recovered by the Reformers was an objective 
        truth completely outside, beyond, and above our experience. It was about 
        God&#8217;s liberating act in Jesus Christ (see Rom. 3:24 NEB). While 
        the whole world was lying in sin and rebellion, God did something for 
        all men. In the person of His Son God satisfied the claims of the law 
        for us, put away the sins of the world, satisfied justice, opened the 
        floodgates of mercy, defeated Satan, destroyed death, and opened Paradise 
        for the most guilty of Adam&#8217;s race. In the words of Martin Luther, 
        &#8220;Christ has vanquished! This is the joyful news! And we are saved 
        by His work, and not by our own.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">The Christian religion is the only religion that bases 
        its message of salvation on objective historical events rather than on 
        subjective experiences. Our salvation was secured by historical events 
        outside the realm of our own experience &#8211; that is, by the incarnation, 
        life, death, and resurrection of Christ. Acting in Jesus Christ, God did 
        something for us two thousand years ago. &#8220;He has taken us into His 
        favor in the person of His beloved Son. &#8220; Eph.1:6 Knox. &#8220;In 
        Christ our release is secured and our sins are forgiven.&#8221; Eph. 1:7, 
        N.E.B. And there is an empty tomb to prove what God has done for us. Good 
        news! Good news! Ring throughout the world!</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">It is unquestionably true that faith in this good news 
        brings to us a new experience of joy, for we have become conscious of 
        something already in existence. There is cause to be exceedingly glad, 
        for our salvation does not rest on our experience, but upon Christ's experience 
        for us. The prophet says, &quot;By His knowledge [that is, by His experience 
        of doing and dying] shall My righteous Servant justify many.&quot; Isa. 
        53:11.</font></p>
      </font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly the gospel is related to human experience. Its 
        acceptance brings repentance for sin, renews us, transforms and sanctifies our lives by the power of the 
        Holy Spirit. But the gospel must never be confused with Christian experience. 
        This is the essential error of Romanism, mysticism, and Pentecostalism.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Proclamation&quot; of the <em>objective</em> Gospel must never be confused with the <em>subjective</em> &quot;Invitation&quot; of the Gospel!!</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">&#8226; To 
          exhort people to draw nigh to God is not proclaiming the gospel.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">&#8226; To 
          call men to repentance is not proclaiming the gospel.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">&#8226; To 
          urge men to believe on Christ is not proclaiming the gospel.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">&#8226; To 
          tell men to make peace with God is not proclaiming the gospel.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">&#8226; To 
          proclaim the necessity of the new birth is not proclaiming the gospel.</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;
      </font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All these things have their place and should be urged as a <em><u>response</u></em> to the gospel, 
        but in themselves they do not constitute the gospel. For the gospel does 
        not tell us to <em>do</em> something. It proclaims what God <em>has</em> done. The gospel 
        does not tell us how to get to God. It tells how God gets to us. It is 
        not man's way to God, but God's way to man. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When sinners hear the gospel of the doing and dying of Christ for the sins of the world, 
          the Spirit is present to draw them to Christ and invites them  to <em>personal</em> repentance towards God, 
          <em> personal</em> faith towards Christ as Savior and Lord, and a new birth in Christ through the indwelling Holy Spirit. Yet the Spirit's activity in human lives is not 
          the <em>proclamation</em> of the historical gospel and must never be substituted for the <em>invitation</em> of gospel to <em>personal</em> faith and repentance.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Protestantism 
        was born out of protest. It protested against that great medieval system 
        which extinguished the light of the New Testament by putting Christian 
        experience in the place of the gospel. The same error is with us today 
        in the modern charismatic movement. Protestants must protest or perish!</font></p>
