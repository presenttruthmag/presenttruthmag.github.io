      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is the baptism of the Holy Spirit? What are the conditions for receiving it? How is it communicated? What is the evidence for its reception? These are urgent questions. They demand a clear answer, especially since the &quot;charismatic&quot; movement is growing rapidly within the Christian churches.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The apostle Paul challenged believers by asking them, &quot;Have ye received the Holy Spirit since you believed?&quot; Acts 19:2. Paul considered the Spirit's baptism to be imperative. To the Ephesians he wrote:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Stop getting drunk on wine, for that means profligacy, but ever be filled with the Spirit.&quot; Eph. 5:18 <em>The Emphasized New Testament </em>(J. B. Rotherham). </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. The Condition Upon Which the Holy Spirit Is Given </strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gospel of the New Testament takes the law of God seriously. No man can be accepted (or justified) in the sight of God, nor share in the life of His Spirit, apart from perfect and absolute obedience to the law of God</font>.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Notice</font>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The doers of the law shall be justified.&quot; Rom. 2:13. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;The Holy Spirit &#8230; [is] given to them that obey Him.&quot; Acts 5:32. </font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If God bestowed His Spirit on any other condition but perfect obedience to His law, this would condone sin and compromise His justice. Above everything else, God's law must be honored, maintained and reverenced.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two ways in which a man may go about meeting this condition 
                  of perfect obedience. There is the way of <em>legalism</em>, and there is the 
                  way of the <em>gospel</em>. Between these two methods there is no compromise. 
                  A man may take one road or the other. He cannot take both.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If a man could obey God's law at all times without any falling short 
              of the divine ideal in any instance, he would be entitled to claim God's 
              promise of life. &quot;Of legal righteousness Moses writes, 'The man who does this shall 
              gain life by it.' &quot; Rom. 10:5, N.E.B. Whether the man aspires to 
              this attainment with or without God's help makes no difference to the 
              principle.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet the reception of God's Spirit is in no sense a human attainment. 
              It is not a reward for a sanctified life. The Bible is clear: &quot;For 
              all have sinned [past tense], and all continue to come short of the 
              divine ideal [present continuous tense].&quot; Rom. 3:23. The human 
              predicament is precisely that no son of Adam has rendered an obedience 
              that would merit the Spirit of God. And because of man's fallen, sinful 
              nature, no one will ever be acceptable to God on the basis of his performance. 
        &quot;By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His 
              sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.&quot; Rom. 3:20.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How then shall a sinful man fulfill the conditions upon which the Spirit 
              of life shall be given? This brings us to consider the way of the gospel. 
              In the person of Jesus Christ, God paid a visit to this planet. He took 
              His place as the new Head of humanity. He became the Representative 
              Man, the Substitute for every man. He undertook to obey the law perfectly 
              for us. He covenanted Himself to die in our stead and thereby release 
              us from the penalty of disobedience. Thus it is written:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;God sent 
                  forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law [i.e., under obligation 
                to satisfy the claims of the law for us].&quot; Gal.4:4. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Jesus 
                    replied, 'It is right for us to meet all the law's demands.' &quot; 
          Matt. 3:15, Phillips. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I am not come to destroy [the law], but 
                    to fulfill [all of its requirements].&quot; Matt. 5:17. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Christ's sinless life and atoning death fulfilled the Law's demands, When He died He made provision for the full satisfaction 
              of the Law's penalty against sin. Thus, He made forgiveness available for every repentant sinner to have his sins forgiven. So Paul declares: &quot;We look at it 
              like this: if One died for all men, then, in a sense, they all died.&quot; 2 Cor. 5:14, Phillips.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The atonement of Christ was the fulfilling of every condition upon 
              which God is able to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh. When the Son 
              of God cried, &quot;It is finished!&quot; every barrier was then broken 
              down which intercepted the freest fullness of the gift of the Spirit 
              to the most guilty of Adam's race. The Spirit is given on the basis 
              of perfect obedience to the law &mdash; not our obedience, but Christ's. The 
              Spirit is given, not because of our attainment, but because of His atonement. 
              His work, and His alone, brings the Spirit to us. This is Paul's message 
            to the Galatians:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For as many 
                  as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, 
                  Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written 
                  in the book of the law to do them. &#8230; Christ hath redeemed us 
                  from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, 
                  Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: that the blessing of Abraham 
                  might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive 
                the promise of the Spirit through faith.&quot; Gal. 3:10, 13,</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Summary:</strong> The one indispensable condition of receiving 
              the Spirit is perfect obedience to God's law. Christ has fulfilled that 
              condition for all. Therefore all repentant sinners who put their faith in Christ are entitled  to the gift of 
            the Holy Spirit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4">2. The Channel of the Spirit's Communication</font></strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Roman Catholic tradition, divine life and power is regarded 
              as being communicated to humanity through the sacraments of the church. 
              In the tradition of the Pentecostal bodies, the Spirit is regarded as 
              being communicated by some high-powered ecstatic experience. But in 
              the Apostolic and Reformation view, the Holy Spirit is communicated 
            through the Word of God.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Word of God is the instrument of the Spirit. The Apostle Paul said: &quot;The sword of the Spirit . . . is the Word of God.&quot; Eph. 6:17. 
        &quot;For the Word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged 
              sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, 
              and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&quot; Heb. 
              4:12, R.S.V. Jesus said, &quot;The words that I speak unto you, they 
            are Spirit, and they are life.&quot; John 6:63.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Word and the Spirit agree. They cannot be separated. That which 
            the Spirit does it does through the instrument of God's Word:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Being born 
                again . . . by the Word of God 1 Peter 1:23.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Now ye are 
                clean through the Word.&quot; John 15:3.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;. . . that 
                  He might sanctify and cleanse it [the church] with the washing of 
                water by the Word.&quot; Eph. 5:26.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Wherewithal 
                  shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according 
                to Thy Word.&quot; Ps. 119:9.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;By the Word 
                  of Thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.&quot; 
          Ps. 17:4.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Sanctify 
                them through Thy truth: Thy Word is truth.&quot; John 17:17.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The life of God is in His Word. It is through the Word that God created 
              this earth and gave life to men. It was through His Word that Jesus 
              healed the sick, cast out devils and raised the dead. &quot;His Word 
              was with power.&quot; He said, &quot;Be clean,&quot; and lepers were 
            cleansed; &quot;Rise and walk,&quot; and the lame rose.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We must guard against the idea that the Spirit of God works independently 
              of the Word, or that He comes in some experience which is outside of 
              the Word. Those who insist on signs and miracles outside of the Word 
              are &quot;an evil and adulterous generation.&quot; In fact, they are 
              wide open for Satanic deception, for the Bible warns us that especially 
              in the last days will Satan work &quot;with power and signs and lying 
              wonders&#8230;in them that perish: because they received not the love 
              of the truth.&quot; 2 Thess. 2:9-10. In the day of judgment many will 
              say, &quot;Lord, Lord, have we not&#8230; done many wonderful works?&quot;' 
            But Christ will say, &quot;I never knew you.&quot; Matt. 7:22-23.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is always a danger that people will want something outside of 
              the Word to create feeling. Through this avenue Satan leads many away 
              from the Word of God into the vagaries of human impressions, impulses, 
              fanatical exercises, and finally into practices contrary to the plain 
              Word of God. There is safety for our feet only in keeping close to God's 
            Word. Here is the source of all truth and power.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Summary:</strong> The life of God is in His Word. Through His 
            Word God communicates His Spirit to men.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"><strong>3. The Method of Receiving the Holy Spirit</strong></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The part that man is called to play in receiving the Spirit is so exceedingly 
              plain and simple that it is an offense to human nature. As we have already 
              seen, Christ has fulfilled the conditions for the Spirit's bestowal. 
              The Word of God in the gospel of Christ is the channel through which 
              the Spirit is communicated. Men receive the Spirit simply by the hearing 
            of faith:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;O foolish 
                  Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, 
                  before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified 
                  among you? This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit 
                by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?&quot; Gal. 3:1-2.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Spirit, therefore, is received by no other way but by hearing the 
              Word. The ear is the most passive organ of the personality. It creates 
              nothing, emotes nothing and sees nothing. It is completely receptive. 
              So man cannot obtain the Spirit; he must be endowed with the Spirit. 
              The sinner cannot get to the Spirit; the Spirit gets to the sinner. 
              It is received by hearing&mdash;the hearing of faith. It is received by faith.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The book of Acts furnishes us with a practical illustration of how 
              the Spirit is received solely by the hearing of faith. Peter was commanded 
              to go to the home of a Roman centurion and preach the gospel to a group 
              of Gentiles. The apostle uplifted Christ and declared, &quot;Whosoever 
              believeth in Him shall receive remission of sins.&quot; Acts 10:43. 
              And the record immediately adds, &quot;While Peter yet spake these words, 
              the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the Word.&quot; Verse 44. 
            There were no exceptions. All who heard the Word received the Spirit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is just as true today. The Word comes to us, saying: &quot;Thy 
              sins be forgiven thee.&quot; Mark 2:5. &quot;He has taken us into His 
              favour in the person of His beloved Son.&quot; Eph. 1:6, Knox. &quot;In 
              Christ our release is secured and our sins are forgiven.&quot; Eph. 
              1:7, N.E.B. The Spirit of the Almighty is present in this Word to create 
              faith. If we receive that Word, we receive the Spirit, for it is still true 
      that the Spirit falls on everyone who hears the Word, not as the word 
      of a mere man (as in Acts 8:12-16), &quot;but as it is in truth, the 
            Word of God.&quot; 1 Thess. 2:13.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wherever the Word of the gospel is preached, it may be said, &quot;For 
              our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in 
            the Holy Ghost.&quot; 1 Thess. 1:5.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not only is the Spirit initially imparted through faith, but it is 
              continuously imparted by faith&mdash;&quot;from faith to faith.&quot; Rom. 
              1:17. &quot;As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so 
              walk ye in Him.&quot; Col. 2:6. Any subsequent operations of the Spirit 
            in life come in the same way as the initial reception.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Acts 2:17-39 'And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your young men shall see visions, Your old men shall dream dreams. 18 And on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days; And they shall prophesy. 19 I will show wonders in heaven above And signs in the earth beneath: Blood and fire and vapor of smoke. 20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the LORD. 21 And it shall come to pass That whoever calls on the name of the LORD Shall be saved.' 22 &quot; Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know -- 23 &quot;Him, being delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death; 24 &quot;whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it. 25 &quot;For David says concerning Him: 'I foresaw the LORD always before my face, For He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken. 26 Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad; Moreover my flesh also will rest in hope. 27 For You will not leave my soul in Hades, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption. 28 You have made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of joy in Your presence.' 29 &quot;Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 30 &quot;Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne, 31 &quot;he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption. 32 &quot;This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses. 33 &quot;Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear. 34 &quot;For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself: 'The LORD said to my Lord, &quot;Sit at My right hand, 35 Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.&quot; ' 36 &quot;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&quot; 37 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, &quot;Men and brethren, what shall we do?&quot; 38 Then Peter said to them, &quot;Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 &quot;For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.&quot; </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God's Word plainly tells us how we know if we have received the Spirit 
              of God. It does not tell us to look to some audio-visual sign. Remember 
              the words of Jesus: &quot;An evil and adulterous generation seeketh 
              after a sign.&quot; Matt. 12:39. The primary evidence of the Spirit 
            is faith&mdash;simple, fussless, unspectacular, gospel faith.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the Corinthian believers were caught up with the idea of the superior 
              value of demonstrative, spiritual ecstasies, Paul directed them to the 
              primacy of faith: &quot;No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by 
              the Holy Ghost.&quot; 1 Cor. 12:3. As if to say, Demonstrative spiritual 
              exercises are not necessarily evidence of the Spirit's working [&quot;Brethren, 
              be not children in understanding&quot; &mdash;1 Cor. 14:20], but the supreme 
              evidence of the Spirit's power is that a sinful, fallen man comes to 
            repentance and confesses his faith in Jesus as the Lord and Saviour of his life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That one who was in rebellion against God can now cry, &quot;Abba [dear) 
            Father,&quot; is the primary evidence of the Spirit's presence and power.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For ye have 
                  not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received

                  beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.&quot;

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ourselves 
                  also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves 
                  groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption 
                  of our body. For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not 
                  hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope 
                  for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.&quot; Rom. 
                8:23-25.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Faith looks to a victorious past (to Christ's work for us on the cross) 
              and to the present (to Christ's intercession for us at the right hand 
              of God). Hope looks to the glorious future of Christ's second coming&mdash;&quot;Being 
              justified by faith, we . . . rejoice in hope of the glory of God.&quot; Rom. 5:1-2.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hope in the coming of Jesus in glory is evidence of the Spirit's presence. 
              Just as the Spirit gives faith to accept Christ as our righteousness, 
              the Spirit inspires hope in the consummation of life at the glorious 
            return of Jesus Christ:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;Looking 
                  for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God 
                and our Saviour Jesus Christ.&quot; Titus 2:13.</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gift of God's Spirit in this life is called &quot;the firstfruits 
              of the Spirit.&quot; Rom. 8:23. In Ephesians 1:14 it is called &quot;the 
              earnest [or the down payment] of our inheritance.&quot; This is a most 
              important point. Our experience in this life is always incomplete. Life 
              is not fulfilled within the historical process. We can never find satisfaction 
              in our own spiritual experience, for at best it is only a &quot;down payment&quot; 
              of what God has in store for us. The Spirit inspires us to groan, wait, 
              long for and press toward the hope of receiving an infilling of the 
              Spirit not possible in this mortal life. Beyond this present feeble 
              existence there awaits us &quot;a far more exceeding and eternal weight 
              of glory.&quot; 2 Cor. 4:17. Meanwhile we walk by faith (2 Cor. 5:7), 
              knowing that although we are imperfect and incomplete, Christ Himself 
              is our completeness (Col. 2:10). Thus our consolation is always in Him 
            and never in our own experience.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third evidence of the Spirit is love. Love (the Greek word is <em>agape</em>) 
              is not an emotional or ecstatic experience. It is not &quot;a funny 
              feeling in the tummy.&quot; It is a holy <em>principle</em> of life wherein God 
              and our fellow men, rather than ourselves, become the object of our 
            concern.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An absorbing preoccupation about one's own spiritual enjoyment and 
              experience is not love, for love &quot;seeketh not her own.&quot; 1 
              Cor. 13:5. Finding satisfaction in feelings of spiritual ecstasy, so 
              far from being evidence of the Holy Spirit's working, is evidence that 
            the Spirit is <em>not</em> working.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Love is more likely to be manifested in patience and self-control, 
              in doing good to others. But most of all, it is not absorbed in experientialism&mdash;the 
              lusting after an exhilarating and satisfying experience. Experientialism 
              is a form of legalism&mdash;the most subtle form of legalism. But the gospel 
              received and believed lets God be God and man be man. It lets God be 
              God in that it rests salvation solely on Christ's experience (Isa. 53:12), 
              and thereby ascribes salvation to God's work alone. When a man is released 
              from doing some work or having some experience upon which to ground 
              his salvation, he is released from egocentric concern and begins to 
              think of his fellow men. In short, the gospel lets men be human. Those 
              who accept the gospel of their deliverance in Christ, make their fellow 
              men the object of their works. They work to make all men see something 
            of &quot;the fellowship of the mystery.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, the Christian will experience the selfishness of his sinful 
              nature always trying to get in the way. He will be tempted to live for 
              himself and to make himself the terminating point of God's mercy and 
              love. That he feels this sin within him is no evidence that he is without 
              the Spirit. But that he fights <em>against</em> the flesh and walks not after 
              it is the surest evidence that he is <em>fighting</em> the good fight of faith 
              in the might of the Spirit's power. Love is not measured by flights 
              of happy feeling, but by willing conformity to the commandments of God&mdash;feeling 
            or no feeling.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Summary:</strong> The evidence of the possession of the Holy 
              Spirit is faith, hope and love. From human sight they are not the most 
              spectacular graces; but from heaven's view they are the supreme miracles 
            of divine grace.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4">5. The Sign of the Spirit's Baptism</font></strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Baptism is the sign of the Spirit's baptism. In the book of Acts we 
            see that the gift of the Spirit was associated with baptism:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Then Peter 
                  said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name 
                  of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the 
                gift of the Holy Ghost.&quot; Acts 2:38.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While Peter 
                  yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard 
                  the Word. And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, 
                  as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was 
                  poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For they heard them speak with 
                  tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, Can any man forbid 
                  water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the 
                  Holy Ghost as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in 
                  the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.&quot; 
          Acts 10:44-48.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Then said 
                  Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying 
                  unto the people, that they should believe on Him which should come 
                  after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were 
                  baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his 
                  hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with 
                tongues, and prophesied.&quot; Acts 19:4-6.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The baptism of water and into Christ is not some deficient initiation 
              that needs to be supplemented by some <em>further</em> baptism. Jesus spoke of 
              a man's entrance into the kingdom of grace as a baptism &quot;of water 
              and of the Spirit.&quot; John 3:5. He commanded His disciples to baptize 
              men &quot;in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
            Ghost.&quot; Matt. 28:19.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, this initiating baptism is the baptism of the Holy Ghost 
              as much as it is the baptism of Christ. Neither is the Spirit bestowed 
            stintingly at the Christian initiation. Says the apostle:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Not by works 
                  of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He 
                  saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy 
                  Ghost; which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior.&quot; 
          Titus 3:5-6.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The church of God is not like the great passenger ships which 'have 
              first- and second-class passengers. The church is the only true class-less 
              society in the world. To a community of believers who were in danger 
              of making distinctions such as &quot;ordinary Christians&quot; and &quot;Spirit-filled 
              Christians,&quot; Paul declared, &quot;For by one Spirit are we all 
              baptized into one body . . . and have been all made to drink into one 
              Spirit.&quot; 1 Cor. 12:13. Again he said, &quot;There is one body, 
            and one Lord, one faith, one baptism.&quot; Eph. 4:4-5.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no such thing as ordinary Christians and Spirit-filled Christians. 
              Either a man is a Spirit-filled Christian or he is not a Christian (Rom. 
              8:9). God does not give to a few individuals an experience differing 
              from the body. There is one Christian baptism &#8211; it is the baptism 
              of water and of the Holy Ghost. There is only one gospel; and it is 
              the full gospel. The Trinity is indivisibly One. The baptism of the 
            Spirit is not a higher experience than the baptism of Christ.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the ordinance of baptism itself is the sign of the Spirit's 
              reception, it is no guarantee of the Spirit. The sign must not be confused 
              with the evidence. Plenty of &quot;gate crashers&quot; get into the 
              church on earth by taking the sign; but the church roll in heaven does 
              not always correspond with the roll on earth. To take the sign apart 
            from the evidence is hypocrisy and blasphemy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we say that true Christian initiation is the baptism of water 
              and of the Spirit, we do not deny that the Spirit may not come at some 
              subsequent times to renew faith, to give power for special occasions, 
              or to impart special gifts for the prosecution of the gospel commission. 
              God is not bound, and the Spirit may reveal Himself as He chooses. Just 
              as the Christian age opened with a mighty outpouring of the Spirit at 
              Pentecost which mightily equipped the believers for service, so the 
              Bible teaches us that the gospel age will close with no less power before 
              the coming of the Lord. This is what the ancient prophets called &quot;the 
            latter rain,&quot; and the time of its bestowal is at hand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prophet exhorts us, &quot;Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of 
              the latter rain.&quot; Zech. 10:1. We shall be safe in doing this if 
              we realize that the Spirit's work is to make us Christ-conscious rather 
              than Spirit-conscious, Christ-centered rather than experience-centered. 
              The Spirit does not speak of Himself (John 16:13). We do not know His 
              name. His sole mission is to glorify Jesus and to make us more and more 
              sensible of our own sinfulness and dependence on a righteousness outside 
            of and above ourselves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Spirit's work in us is not the end and Christ only the means to 
              that end. Rather, Christ is the end, and the Spirit is the means of 
              laying hold on Him. Christian experience, however Spirit-filled, does 
              not recommend us to God's favor. The sanctification of the Spirit does 
              not lead a believer to attain higher than, or to surpass the primacy 
              of, justification. Indeed, as one has well said, &quot;Sanctification 
              is our taking justification seriously,&quot; and the Spirit is given 
            to us for that end. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Summary:</strong> Baptism is the sign of the Spirit's baptism. 
                The Trinity is indivisible in His work. The members of the church all 
                enjoy one baptism and one Spirit. The ongoing work of the Spirit will 
                not lead us to another experience, but will re-enforce us and settle 
              us more firmly in the truth of justification by grace through faith.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"><strong>6. The Fullness of the Gift of the Spirit</strong></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While in this life we only possess the first fruits of the Spirit, 
              yet in the gospel sense we possess a fullness of the Spirit that can 
              never be transcended or superseded. This is the message of the book 
              of Colossians. The Christians at Colosse were troubled by a &quot;higher 
              life&quot; group who were not content to live the normal Christian life 
              of faith and hope. (The problem is still with the church. Human nature 
              does not want to endure its sense of weakness, sinfulness and finiteness. 
              It does not want to endure the day-to-day reality of dirty dishes, frayed 
              nerves and a persistent fight against the flesh.) Thus some of the Colossians 
              advocated seeking a fullness of the Spirit that would lift them into 
              such spiritual ecstasy that they would soar above their poor, struggling, 
              earthly Christian brethren. (How nice! And what Christian has not thought 
              that such a charge of spiritual power might lift him above the tedious 
            conflict of life.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So this holiness group sought for a fullness of the Spirit that transcended 
        a &quot;mere&quot; enjoyment of Christ and a &quot;mere&quot; justification 
                by faith. Of course, since their aspirations went beyond the simple 
        &quot;by faith&quot; formula, they began to practice and impose 
                rules and formulae of their own devisings. (These are still seen in 
                modern books that specialize in subjectivity &#8211; i.e., Secrets of 
                a Victorious Christian Experience &#8211; 70 Steps Which Show You How, 
                or Preparation for the Spirit's Baptism &#8211; 7 Conditions for You 
              to Receive It.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The apostle Paul showed the Colossians that this program of making 
              the attainment of a high spiritual experience the center of concern 
              was legalism. His answer to this &quot;holiness&quot; group was a magnificent 
              exaltation of the person of Christ and the absolute centrality of Him 
              in the church's faith. Paul's key word was fullness. Meeting the heretics 
              on their own ground, he showed the church where that fullness can alone 
              exist in Jesus Christ and never in another. &quot;For it pleased the 
              Father that in Him should all fullness dwell.&quot; &quot;For in Him 
            dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&quot; Col. 1:19; 2:9.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As our Substitute, Christ not only rendered to God everything that 
              we owed in perfect obedience; as a Man in our place, He also received 
              from God everything that God had to give and longed to give us &#8211; 
        even all the fullness of His own life. In Christ, humanity has received 
        the totality of God's life. In Him we have been filled with all the 
        fullness of God. It could never be any other way but in Him, for no 
        one other than this God-Man could contain all the accumulated fullness 
        of eternity. Faith staggers not at the gift God has given us in Christ, 
        but confesses that in Christ God has given all; and in simple faith 
        the Christian possesses all. Thus Paul says: &quot;And ye are complete 
            [have been made full] in Him.&quot; Col. 2:10.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this sense a repentant believer can never have anything more than when He 
              accepts Christ as the Savior and the Lord of his life. He lives &quot;as 
              having nothing, and yet possessing all things.&quot; 2 Cor. 6:10. Faith 
              embraces Christ and that fullness in Him; hope patiently waits for the 
            inheritance, knowing that life is not fulfilled here and now.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Summary:</strong> 
        In this life we can never experience enough of God's Spirit to satisfy 
        either God or ourselves. Yet the humanity of Christ has received all 
        the fullness of God for us. We have it now by faith, and shall possess 
        it by visible reality at the coming of Christ.</font></p>
