      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>A Forum on Pentecostalism</strong></font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">Editorial Note:</font></strong><font size="2"> We believe that our readers will be interested in reading a transcript of a forum on Pentecostalism which was held recently in Brisbane, Australia. The hall of the Canberra Hotel was packed by clergymen and informed lay Christians to hear a panel of speakers from the U.S.A., New Zealand, and Australia discuss whether the charismatic movement belongs to the Catholic or Protestant stream of thought. For most of those present, it was a new approach to the challenge of neo-Pentecostalism. </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The panel consisted of a teacher from New Zealand (Mr. John Slade), a doctor from the U.S.A. (Jack Zwemer), and the editor and his brother (Robert and John Brinsmead), who are Australians.</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></p>
      <p><b><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Chairman&nbsp;&#8212; Mr. 
        John Slade:</font></b> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The modern Pentecostal 
        movement made its appearance early in this century in the United States. 
        In 1900 a young Methodist minister, Charles Parham, joined with forty 
        other persons in Kansas to seek for the Pentecostal baptism of the Spirit. 
        After several days of persistence in seeking the blessing, one by one 
        was visited with an overwhelming experience which became known as the 
        "baptism of the Spirit." Speaking in tongues marked their experience. 
        Parham's ministry was attended with power from that time forward. W. J. 
        Seymour led out in California, and the characteristic manifestations of 
        the early Pentecostal meetings broke out simultaneously in many different 
        religious communities.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the years that 
        followed the Pentecostals were not accepted by the established churches. 
        In spite of opposition, however, they continued to grow until they numbered 
        about eight million members by 1960.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 1960 there has 
        been a most remarkable growth in the Pentecostal movement. In the past 
        decade the denominational barriers which have kept Pentecostalism separated 
        from the churches have been tumbling down. What Pentecostalism calls "baptism 
        in the Spirit" has become popular among thousands in the conservative 
        Protestant churches and also in the Catholic Church. With great enthusiasm 
        the leading sponsors of the experience say that the Holy Spirit is breaking 
        down the denominational barriers.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Men of talent, money 
        and influence are joining the ranks of those who have received the "baptism." 
        Interdenominational groups, such as The Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship 
        International, are very active in spreading what is being called today 
        "the third force" or "the third arm" in Christendom. Religious commentators 
        also are beginning to recognize the charismatic movement as the third 
        great force in the Christian world.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The current deep interest 
        in the Pentecostal movement should lead us to follow the Apostle John's 
        counsel to Christians: "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the 
        spirits whether they be of God: because many false prophets are gone out 
        into the world." 1 John 4:1. We are challenged, therefore, to examine 
        the basis and nature of this movement and measure it by the Word of God.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two streams 
        of Christian thought &mdash;Catholic and Protestant. In which stream does Pentecostalism 
        belong? What were the great issues of the Protestant Reformation? Does 
        Pentecostalism affirm or deny the principles of Protestantism?</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our first speaker 
        this evening is Robert Brinsmead, who will discuss the role of grace in 
        redemption.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Robert Brinsme</b><strong>ad: </strong>The New Testament 
        presents two aspects of God's redemptive activity:</font>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Number 1</strong> 
          &mdash; God's work <strong>for us</strong> in Christ.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Number 2</strong> 
          &mdash; God's work <strong>in us</strong> by the Holy Spirit.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font color="#990000" size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="800000">Number 
        1:</font></strong></font>        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God's work <strong>for us</strong> in Christ, is the gospel. It is the 
        proclamation of what God has done in His Son for the human family. As Paul 
        declares, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself." 2 Cor. 
        5:19. He has taken us into His favor in the Person of His beloved Son. 
        For in Christ our release is secured and our sins are forgiven (Eph. 1:6, 
        7, The N.T. from 26 Translations).</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God's work for us 
        in Christ may also be called Christ's work. "Christ died for our sins 
        according to the Scriptures." 1 Cor. 15:3. He "was delivered for our offences, 
        and was raised again for our justification." Rom. 4:25. It is important 
        to notice that the gospel is the record of what God has done. It is not 
        the record of what God <em>has done in us;</em> neither is it the record of what 
        God <em>will do in us</em>. The gospel is the record of what God has done <em>outside 
        of us</em>. He did it in the Lord Jesus Christ. While we were yet sinners, 
        when we were His enemies, while we were going from Him more and more, 
        God did something for us <em>in Christ </em>(see Rom. 5:6-10).</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Romans 5, Paul 
        presents the contrast between Adam and Christ. Through the disobedience 
        of Adam, the whole human race was constituted sinful in the sight of God. 
        When the devil conquered Adam, he conquered the whole human family. God 
        redeemed the human race by offering us another Head, a new Father to stand 
        at the head of the human race (Isa. 9:6). And<em> in Christ</em>, God has made provision for the redemption of 
        the entire human family. He bought us with the precious blood of Christ. <em>In Christ,</em>        He put our sins away on the cross.<em> In Christ</em>, He gave us a perfect righteousness 
        (Rom. 5:18-19). Thus the gospel is the record of what God has done<em> in Christ</em>, not 
        <em>in</em> us but <em>outside</em> of us, even in His Son Jesus Christ while we were yet 
        sinners.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="800000" size="5">Number 
        2:</font></strong> Now we turn our attention to the second aspect of God's 
        activity &mdash; God's work <strong>in us</strong> by the Holy Spirit. The relation 
        between Number 1 and Number 2 must be clearly understood. Number 1 is 
        the <em>gospel</em>; Number 2 is the<em> fruit</em> of believing in the 
        gospel. <em>To confuse them</em> is the very essence of Roman 
        thought; to see<em> no connection between them</em> is the essence 
        of antinomian thought. Faith in God's work for us (i.e., faith in Number 
        1) brings the Holy Spirit to us. The Scripture is clear that faith in 
        what God has done for us in Jesus Christ brings the Holy Spirit to the 
        believer in order that he may be filled and baptized in the Spirit (see 
        Gal. 3:14; John 7:37, 38).</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The relationship that 
        exists between Number 1 and Number 2 is very important. True Christian 
        experience finds its joy, its fulfillment and its satisfaction in Number 
        1. This is because Number 1 is an <em>finished</em> work. God's work for us in 
        Christ is a <em>complete</em> work. Our personal acceptance with God as repentant believing sinners is grounded upon it. 
        Our right standing with God is based upon what He has done for us in Jesus. 
        It is Christ's experience that has merit rather than our own. Isaiah 53:11 
        declares, "By His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify many." 
        The word "knowledge" means experience. That is to say, "By His wounds, 
        by His suffering, by His holy living, by His sacrificial dying and His 
        triumphant resurrection, shall My righteous Servant justify many."</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A  repentant believing Christian finds his joy 
         in something outside of himself &mdash; the experience of Jesus. 
        God mercifully took our sinful history and imputed that to His Son; and He then takes 
        the history of Jesus' infinitely sinless life and <em>reckons</em> that to us through faith.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The words of Jesus 
        in Luke 10:17-20 are very significant. They record how the disciples returned 
        to Christ with great satisfaction after a successful mission of healing, 
        preaching and casting out devils. Jesus said to them, "Behold, I give 
        you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of 
        the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. Notwithstanding in 
        this rejoice not. . . but rather rejoice, because your names are written 
      in heaven." </font>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What wonderful instruction we find here! Jesus was telling 
          His disciples not to find their joy, fulfillment and satisfaction in what 
          God was accomplishing<em> in them</em>, but He said, Rejoice rather in what has 
          been done for you. Through My merit your names have been written in heaven. 
          We must not seek to find our fulfillment, our satisfaction and our joy 
          in Number 2 &mdash; the inward work. Love does not look inward, for love seeks 
          not its own (1 Cor. 13:5). Nor does love rejoice in its own. To look inward 
          for our fulfillment and our satisfaction leads to the greatest pride &mdash; 
        the pride of grace. To make one's own experience the center of his concern 
        is the very negation of the gospel. It is the worst form of spiritual 
        perversion.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want to use an illustration 
        that may show the relationship between Christ's work for us and Christ's 
        work in us. No doubt you have tried this simple balancing trick. (The 
        speaker begins to balance a broom on his finger.) It is not hard to do 
        if one simple principle is followed. What is the secret of balancing this 
        broom on my finger? If my eye is focused on the top, I can balance it. 
        My finger underneath is moving. It may be engaged in considerable movement, 
        but I am scarcely conscious of it. Now, if I focus my attention on what 
        my finger is doing, it is impossible to maintain the balance of the broom. 
        So we must look to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith. It is 
        by finding our satisfaction in Him, it is by beholding what He has done 
        for us and what He is to us, that we maintain a successful Christian experience. 
        But if His work <em>in us </em>becomes the center of our concern, we shall sink 
        as quickly as Peter sank when he turned his eyes off the Lord Jesus Christ.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is what happened 
        to the early church. The history of the &quot;falling away&quot; is a most fascinating 
        one. The early church lost the great truth of justification by faith as 
        it became more and more concerned with the <em>subjective</em> aspect of faith, <em>sanctification</em>. 
        God's <em>work in Christ</em> became subordinated to God's <em>work in man</em>. Justification 
        was subordinated to sanctification. Finally the medieval church taught 
        that instead of a believer being acceptable in God's sight on the meritorious basis 
        of what Christ had done, a man was acceptable to God by virtue of what 
        the Holy Spirit had accomplished in his life. Thus, men looked to themselves 
        and to their experience for their acceptance with God.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The great issue of 
        the religious struggle in the sixteenth century was this: Is man justified 
        in God's sight on the basis of what grace does <em>in him</em>, or on the basis of what grace did <em>in Christ</em>? 
        On one side stood the medieval church; on the other side stood the Reformation. 
        At least both lines of thought claimed something in common. The schoolmen 
        taught that a man was justified, that is, accepted in the sight of God, 
        by God's <em>work of grace</em>. The Reformers also taught that a man was justified, 
      or accepted in God's sight, by God's <em>work of grace</em>. </font>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus far <em>both</em> streams 
          of thought seemed to be the same. But what was the essential <em>difference</em> between 
          the medieval and Reformation thought? The medieval church laid down its 
          premise that a repentant sinner is  accepted in God's sight on the  basis of God's 
          work of <em>sanctifying</em> grace <em>imparted </em>or <em>infused</em> into him. In contrast, the Reformers laid down 
          the great apostolic principle that a repentant sinner is accepted in God's sight on the  basis of God's work of 
          <em>justifying</em> grace <em>imputed </em>or <em>reckoned</em> to him, through<em> faith</em> in the sinless life and atoning death of <em>Christ alone</em>. </font>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One stream of thought 
        is man-centered; the other is Christ-centered. One is <em>subjective</em>; the 
        other is <em>objective</em>. One looks inward; the other looks outward. When we 
        analyze all the false religions of the world, we find they have one thing in 
        common &mdash; man's experience is the center of concern. </font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gospel proclaiming the sinless life and atoning death of <em>Christ 
          alone</em> is different. It looks <em>outward</em> to the doing and dying of Christ on the cross and <em>upward</em> to Christ as ones High Priest in heaven where Christ pleads His merits before the Law of God as the basis of the repentant sinner's acceptance with God. </font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Reformation stream  of teaching, the repentant sinner trusts only in the blood of Christ for his acceptance with God. He can <em>rejoice</em> that <em>in Christ</em> he can eagerly await the Last Day, because he <em>has been</em> and <em>is being </em>reckoned as righteous in God's sight through faith. </font>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Medieval stream of teaching, the repentant sinner is never sure that he has enough infused or imparted righteousness through the indwelling Holy Spirit for his acceptance with God. This inner turmoil of uncertainty of not knowing if one has enough of the indwelling Holy Spirit can have devastating effects. This can  lead on the one hand to tremendous feelings of guilt, neuroses, or even a death wish;  or  on the other hand delusions of false personal holiness and self-righteousness. </font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this light we ask 
        these questions: In which stream of thought is Pentecostalism? In which 
        stream of thought is the prevailing current of the Jesus Revolution? And 
      what is the center of concern in your religious thinking?</font>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Chairman</b><strong>:</strong> Thank you very 
        much, Mr. Robert Brinsmead. Now, what is the true function of the Holy Spirit in 
        the life of the believer? John Brinsmead, can you answer this question 
        for us? </font>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="3">John Brinsmead:</font></strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In Romans 1:16, 
        17 the Apostle Paul declares: "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: 
        for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; 
        to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness 
        of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall 
      live by faith." </font>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the fourth chapter of this same book, the apostle tells 
          us that this righteousness provided for us in Jesus is an <em>imputed</em> righteousness, 
          a <em>reckoned</em> righteousness, an <em>accounted</em> righteousness. What is the relation 
          of the Holy Spirit's work to this gift of righteousness? Jesus said, "When 
          He, the Spirit of truth, is come. . . . He shall glorify Me." John 16:13, 
          14. The great object of the Holy Spirit is to magnify 
          that incomprehensible, infinite righteousness of God Himself, revealed 
      to the human family and for the human family in Jesus Christ. </font>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Spirit's 
            work is to glorify Jesus' perfect obedience, His spotless merits, His 
            sinless life. Christ was uplifted on the cross as a display of God's righteousness. 
            The Spirit's work is to show that to men. For without the Spirit we are 
            dead in sins; our eyes are blind, and we cannot see. By nature we cannot 
            understand even the plain things of God's Word. So the Holy Spirit operates 
            through the preaching of the gospel. It is the Spirit's work to create 
            faith &mdash; saving faith in the merits of Christ. The Spirit points sinners 
            to the great covering of Christ's righteousness and teaches them to run 
            under this shelter of the Almighty. The creation of faith is not our work. 
            Faith is not a mere mental assent or intellectual belief. It is the Spirit's 
            conviction and persuasion that when Jesus hung upon the cross, He hung 
            there in my place, He hung there in your place. Faith is to know with 
            assurance that He "loved me, and gave Himself for me." Gal. 2:20. The 
            Spirit will create faith in the hearts of all who will not harden their 
            hearts through unbelief.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oh, the atonement 
        of Jesus is a magnificent thing! He has embraced the whole human family. 
        The cords of divine love have included us all &mdash; rich, poor, high and low. 
        No one has been left out. Christ has bound humanity to himself by a tie 
        of love that can never be broken by any power save by the choice of man 
        himself.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Christian life 
        begins in faith; it will end in faith. It is faith from start to finish. 
        This faith is counted for righteousness (Rom. 4:5). This is what the Bible 
        calls "righteousness by faith." God gave us His Son. The Son gave us His 
        righteous life. The Spirit who has convicted us of sin also gives us the ability to trust in Christ. Thus, salvation is the saving 
        action of the Godhead.</font>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you. &quot;And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: John 16:7-8 </font>           </p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is the work of 
        the Holy Spirit to make us Christ-conscious, and not Spirit-conscious. 
        He does not come to testify of Himself. Jesus said, "When He, the Spirit 
        of truth, is come . . . He shall not speak of Himself." John 16:13. He 
        never bears testimony to Himself. The life of Jesus of Nazareth was a 
        revelation, not merely of Himself, but of the Father of glory. So the Holy Spirit only comes to reveal Jesus, to make us conscious of what 
        He has done for us and what He is to us. In the guilty sinner convicted of his sin and conscious of his wretched condition, the Holy Spirit inspires faith in Christ, 
        the divine <em>remedy</em> for sin. The Spirit, even unto the Last Day, makes us utterly dependent upon 
        that righteousness which is outside of ourselves, even that righteousness 
        which is in the Person of Christ, who stands at God's right hand for us.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much less does the 
        Spirit make us experience-conscious. When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, 
        his face was radiant with the glory of God. Yet the record says that he 
        was unconscious of it.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The book of Acts records 
        how the Spirit was poured out when Jesus Christ was uplifted (see chs. 
        2, 10, 19), when the death and the resurrection of Jesus were preached. 
        The Spirit glorified Jesus. He did not come upon men after a sermon on 
        the Holy Spirit. He was manifested in power when Jesus, the Savior of 
        the world, was uplifted.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another office of 
        the Holy Spirit is to teach the believer the Word of God. The Word reveals 
        Jesus &mdash;His infinite merits and righteousness. The Word alone is the supreme 
        judge of all experience and all doctrine. In Protestantism the Word of 
        God is the only infallible rule of conduct and religious doctrine. But 
        in the other stream of thought we have the dependence on miracles, visions, 
        sacraments &mdash; on something apart from, or outside, the Word. The modern 
        charismatic movement also looks to audio-visual evidence of the Spirit's 
        work.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another great work 
        of the Holy Spirit is to write God's law in the hearts and the minds of 
        His people. Then His people bring forth fruit unto God (Heb. 8:10; Rom. 
        7:4), not in order that they might be accepted of God, but because they 
        have accepted their acceptance in Jesus Christ.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, we must always 
        remember that our right to heaven is not based on what the Holy Spirit 
        does within us, but upon what God has done <em>outside</em> of us in Christ. Our 
        title to heaven is founded on what  has 
        been done for all of us in Jesus. John 3:34 says, "For He whom God hath sent 
        speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto 
        Him." In Christ was manifested all the fullness of the Godhead bodily 
        (Col. 2:9). He was the complete revelation of God's righteousness. That 
        is our only right and title to be with Him where He is and behold His 
        glory. Every religion which is not of divine origin teaches men, either 
        initially or eventually, to look within their experience for right standing 
        with God &#8211; to look for some great miracle, some change, some fruit.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are basically 
        only two streams of religious thought &mdash; Protestant and Catholic. All humanity 
        is divided here. It does not matter what creed we claim. Are we pointing 
        to, glorying in and rejoicing in what God has done through His divine 
        Spirit in the one Man, Jesus? Is that our vital testimony to the world? 
        Or are we down in the realm of the subjective, glorying in and testifying 
        to what we imagine the Holy Spirit is doing in us?</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Chairman:</strong> Thank you, John 
        Brinsmead. Now, friends, let us bring things together. We have looked 
        at two streams of thought this evening on three major areas of New Testament 
        teaching. Dr. Zwemer, where does the modern charismatic movement lie in 
        relation to them?</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Dr. Jack Zwe</b><strong>mer: </strong>This evening 
        we have sought to establish three fundamental points as they relate to 
        the only two systems of religious thought which exist. One system is the 
        Protestant Reformation ethic; the other system is the ethic of the medieval 
        church, which will yet be shown to embrace all other religious forms. 
        The three points made this evening are these:</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">1. </font></strong>Reformation thought 
        declares that man's acceptance with God depends on the absolute and infinite 
        righteousness of man's Substitute, his Representative &mdash; the Man Christ 
        Jesus, who stands in the presence of God for us. That is the Protestant 
        ground of acceptance. For that Man only is pleasing to the Father.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other system of 
        religious thought declares that God is pleased and satisfied with an inherent, 
        an acquired righteousness, a borrowed goodness <em>in</em> man.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, the Reformers 
        looked outside themselves for righteousness that inheres in their Substitute 
        before God's throne, while the other system looks downward upon man and 
        within man to find an exhibition of something that might be pleasing to 
        God.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">2. </font></strong>The second point 
        tonight relates to the nature of the Christian man. The Protestant always 
        regards himself as a sinner &mdash; "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and 
        blind, and naked." As the Apostle Paul came to the end of his life and 
        said, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am 
        chief," so the Christian man in Reformation thought regards himself as 
        a sinner. He freely admits it. As he progresses in the Christian pathway, 
        he becomes increasingly conscious of the fact that he is a sinner in himself. 
        This, of course, impels him to look out of himself and upward to where 
        his Righteousness is.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, 
        the medieval school man looks within himself and regards himself, not 
        as a sinner, but as a saint. This he freely admits, and he becomes increasingly 
        unconscious of any sinfulness inherent in him. And so we have the second 
        great divide in Christendom.</font>
      <p><strong><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third point 
        concerns the Spirit and His work. Reformation thought declares that the 
        Holy Spirit is freely given that men might see their own utter moral and 
        spiritual bankruptcy and then as convicted repentant sinners flee out of themselves to Jesus Christ, 
        in whom inheres righteousness and infinite goodness. To these the fruits 
        of the Spirit are abundantly given &mdash; faith, hope, charity and all good 
        works. When they come up to the Final Summons, they ask, "When did we 
        do this? When did we do that?" They are unconscious of what they have 
        done. They are conscious only of their utter sinfulness and the infinite 
        righteousness of their Substitute.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, 
        the medieval system of thought sees in the gift of the Spirit a benefit 
        derived by super-human effort, which conveys an experiential and ecstatic 
        thing and a confidence within oneself. It is Spirit-conscious and self-conscious 
        as opposed to Christ-conscious.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These three points 
        divide the religious world into two incompatible and disharmonious camps. 
        So we speak to our dear friends and neighbors who are Pentecostals, who 
        perhaps belong to the Jesus Revolution or to any system centered experientially 
        in man. Many of you perhaps have recognized the deadness and spiritual 
        lack in the established bodies and have sought fulfillment in some of 
        these other movements. We must, however, say to you that these are not 
        founded upon, nor do they embrace, the great fundamental doctrines of 
        the Protestant Reformation and that gospel so fully given to the Apostle 
        Paul.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we will read some 
        comments in the literature regarding this. I quote from recognized leaders 
        of thought. One of the leaders of the Pentecostal movement, Donald Gee, 
        declares that the central attraction of the Pentecostal movement consists 
        "purely of a powerful, individual, spiritual experience." &mdash; <em>The Pentecostal 
        Movement</em>, p. 30. Another authentic leader of the charismatic movement, 
        Edward O' Connor, declares:</font>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But the essential 
        configurations of the movement from a theological point of view seem to 
        lie in a lively and convinced faith in the Holy Spirit, the experience 
        of His powerful action and the reappearance of His charisms." &mdash; Edward 
        D. O'Connor, <i>The Pentecostal Movement in the Catholic Church</i>.</font> 
      </ul>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We pass from the self-view 
        of Pentecostal thought to the Protestant view, and I quote Frederick Bruner, 
        who writes briefly as follows:</font>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Pentecostal experience, 
        then, is distinguished by precisely the emphasis on experience. In a word, 
        the theology of the Pentecostal Movement is its experience, which is another 
        way of saying that its theology is pneumatology." &mdash; <i>A Theology of the 
        Holy Spirit</i>, p.32.</font> 
      </ul>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We could read further, 
        but we pass on to a view of the charismatic movement made by Catholic 
        observers. We read as follows:</font>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Although they derive 
        from Protestant backgrounds, the Pentecostal churches are not typically 
        Protestant in their beliefs, attitudes or practices." &mdash; O'Connor, <em>op. 
        cit.</em>, p.23.<br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <p><font size="2">"From the point of view of the Catholic Church, it cannot 
          be assumed that the Pentecostal movement represents an incursion of 
          Protestant influence." &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>., p.32.</font>
        <p><font size="2">"Catholics who have accepted Pentecostal spirituality 
          have found it to be fully in harmony with their traditional faith and 
          life. They experience it, not as a borrowing from an alien religion, 
          but as a connatural development of their own." <em>Ibid</em>., p.28.</font>
        <p><font size="2">". . . the spiritual experience of those who have been 
          touched by the grace of the Holy Spirit in the Pentecostal movement 
          is in profound harmony with the classical spiritual theology of the 
          Church." &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>., p.183.</font>
        <p><font size="2">". . . the experience of the Pentecostal movement tends 
          to confirm the validity and relevance of our authentic spiritual traditions." 
          &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>., p. 191.</font>
        <p><font size="2">"Moreover, the doctrine that is developing in the Pentecostal 
          churches today seems to be going through stages very similar to those 
          which occurred in the early Middle Ages when the classical doctrine 
          was taking shape." &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>., p.193.</font></font> 
      </ul>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, two other 
        Catholic authors write most significantly as follows:</font>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>The Cross and 
          the Switchblade</em> is the account of the life and spiritual adventures 
          of David Wilkerson. . . . The book spoke of the indwelling and powerful 
          Spirit as the motive and moving power of our Christian lives. It was 
          very old doctrine, it was a very traditional doctrine, it was a very 
          Catholic doctrine." &mdash; Kevin & Dorothy Ranaghan, <em>Catholic Pentecostals</em>, 
          pp.9-10. &nbsp;</font></p>
