                              was the most astounding thing that ever happened to this earth. Nothing 
                              like it had ever happened before. Nothing like it could ever happen again. 
                              The High and Holy One, who dwells in light unapproachable and majesty incomprehensible, 
                              became a member of the human family. The Creator of heaven, earth and the 
                              galaxies of limitless space, was born of a woman, grew up in a humble peasant 
                              home, traveled about as an itinerant preacher, died in ignominy and shame, 
                              rose from the grave and ascended to heaven. The twelve apostles were chosen 
        eyewitnesses of these things.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then the ascended Christ chose another man through whom 
          the Holy Spirit would show the real meaning of those historical events 
          which the twelve apostles witnessed. It is in Paul that the gospel, given 
          to the Hebrews in types, shadows and promises, is fully revealed (Col. 
          1:26; Eph. 3:5; Rom. 16:25, 26; 1 Peter 1:10-12; Heb. 1:2). The full disclosure 
          of the gospel was committed to Paul's trust (Col. 1:25-27; Eph. 3:8; 
          Gal. 1:12; 1 Tim. 1:11; 2Tim. 2:8; Titus 1:3; 1 Cor. 3:10; 2 Cor. 12:1-5,

But I refrain, lest anyone should think of me above what he sees me to be or hears from me. 7 And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. 8 Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. 9 And He said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.&quot; Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong. 11 I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you;<strong> for in nothing was I behind the most eminent apostles,</strong> though I am nothing. 12 <strong>Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you </strong>with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds. </font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul's gospel theme was Christ and Him crucified for the

                apostles also bore witness to the salvation of sinners through Jesus, 
                but Paul shows how the gospel is a revelation of the righteousness of 
                God (Rom. 1:16, 17).</font></p>

      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> How could a just God justify sinners? How could God's 
                    holy law be vindicated and its integrity maintained if God remitted a 
                    rebel's punishment? How is the extension of mercy to law breakers consistent 
                    with the claims of divine justice? These are not just interesting questions. 
                    They must be answered if estranged man is to be reconciled to the character 
                  of God.</font></p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="4"><strong>Justification</strong></font></p>
      </font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The key word in Paul is <em>justification</em>. In both the Old 
        and New Testaments the words <em>justify</em> and <em>justification</em> have a very definite 
        legal and judicial meaning. They are words closely related to the idea 
        of trial and judgment (Deut. 25:1; 1 Cor. 4:3, 4; Matt. 12:37). Justification 
        may be defined as <em>being declared just by court order</em>. When God is said 
        to justify a man, it means that He has brought the case to trial before 
        His divine judgment seat and, after examining the case, has pronounced 
        the accused as free of all fault and blame, as altogether righteous and 
        pleasing in the sight of His holy law. In modern English, the word <em>acceptance</em>        and <em>forgiveness</em> would also convey the meaning of justification.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="3">If justification means being declared righteous before 
        the bar of the most infinite justice, who then can be justified? Alas!

      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;How can man be justified with God? Or how can he be clean that is 
              born of a woman?&quot; &quot;What is man, that he should be clean? And 
              he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? Behold, He putteth 
              no trust in His saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in His sight How 
              much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?&quot; 
          Job 25:4; 15:14-16.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Pauline Epistle to the Romans</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his great epistle to the Romans, the apostle sets out 
            to answer the universal cry of the human heart, &quot;How . . . can man 
            be justified with God?&quot; Job 25:4. If that question means, &quot;What 
            can I do that will cause God to accept me?&quot; Paul's answer is emphatic: 
            There is absolutely nothing anyone can do to earn the forgiveness of sin and eternal life!</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before the apostle presents <em>God's way</em> of reaching man, 
          he exposes the futility of <em>man's way</em> of reaching God. Paul emphatically declares that no one is righteous, 
          no one understands, no one seeks God, no one does good!!</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As it is written: &quot;There is none righteous, no, not one; There is none who understands; There is none who seeks after God. They have all turned aside; They have together become unprofitable; There is none who does good, no, not one.&quot; Rom. 3:10-12. </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No one 
            has a life that will meet the standard of the law of God, </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified 
                  in His sight.&quot; Rom. 3:20.</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul does not simply say that no one can <em>become</em> (future tense) just in 
        God's sight by his performance. He uses the<em> future tense</em> of the verb. 
        He means that no mortal man will <em>ever</em> be considered just on the basis 
        of his own life!! No man can confront the judgment of God with an easy 
        conscience if his standing rests upon the quality of his own life. The 
        reason is very plainly stated: &quot;For all have sinned, and continue 
        to come short (In the Greek, the verb for &#8220;come&#8221; is in the 
        <em>present</em> <em>continuous</em> tense) of the glory of God.&quot; Rom. 3:23. Or as 
        Solomon declares, &quot;There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth 
        good, and sinneth not.&quot; Eccl. 7:20. </font></p>

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="3">Having abased all human pride and having exposed the futility 
        of all human achievement, the apostle shows that man's justification proceeds 
        wholly from God:</font></p>
      </font>      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;Being

          Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in 
          His (<em>Christ's</em>) blood, to declare His (<em>Christ's</em>) righteousness for the remission of sins that 
          are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this 
          time His (<em>Christ's</em>) righteousness: that He might be just, and the justifier of 
        him which believeth in Jesus.&quot; Rom. 3:24-26.</font></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These three brief verses contain the meat of Paul's gospel. 
            They are wonderful in brevity and amazing in scope. The rest of the epistle of Romans
            may be regarded as an expansion of these three verses.</font></p>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
            <p><font size="3">Notice how these verses cover justification from three 
        aspects: by <em>grace</em>. by <em>Christ</em>, and by <em>faith</em>. Here we view the saving activity 
        of God: God the <em>Father</em> justifies us by His 
        unmerited grace, God the <em>Son</em> justifies us by giving His sinless life to die in our place, and God the <em>Holy Spirit</em>        enables us to personally accept it by giving us faith.</font></p>
            <p><font size="4"><strong>By Grace &#8211; the Source of Justification</strong></font></p>
      </font>
            <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Being justified freely by His [the Father's) grace 
        ...&quot; <em>Grace</em> means <em>mercy</em> and <em>favor</em> shown to one who is lost and undeserving. 
        In order to guard the absolute gratuitous nature of justification, Paul 
        says that sinners are justified <em>freely</em> by God's grace. The word &quot;freely&quot; 
        means &quot;without a cause&quot;. No amount of  
        obedience to God's law or character building ever causes God to regard a man 
        as just in His sight. Someone has appropriately said that justification 
        by grace means the divine <em>acceptance</em> of <em>unacceptable</em> people.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is most important to notice also that Paul is not just 
          talking about becoming justified at the <em>beginning</em> of the Christian 
          life. He uses the present <em>continuous</em> tense of the verb, &quot;<em>Being</em> justified&#8221;. 
          This includes the state of <em>remaining</em> justified as much as the act of <em>becoming</em>        justified. This means that we can never get beyond justification by grace. 
          We can <em>remain</em> in God's favor only by <em>pure unmerited mercy</em>. Grace finds us 
          sinners, and we remain justified just as long as we remain sinners in 
          our own eyes. If at any time we could stand acceptable before God because 
          of our obedience, or moral excellence, or character building it would no longer be justification 
          by <em>grace alone</em>.</font></p>

      </font>
            <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We must also understand the way grace operates to make 
        sinful man acceptable in the sight of God. The way of our justification 
        is said to be &quot;through the redemption that is<em> in Christ Jesus</em> [through 
        His act of liberation in the person of Christ Jesus, N.E.B.].&quot; Rom. 
        3:24. </font></p>

            </blockquote>            
            <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The doing and the dying (His sinless life and atoning death) of our Lord Jesus Christ constitute the 
          only basis of our acceptance with God. He became the divine Substitute and Surety 
          for us poor, lost sinners. On our behalf He gave to the law an obedience 
          that measured with its infinite claims. On our behalf, by His own dying 
        agonies, He paid to God's law the debt due to our transgressions.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christ's <em>active obedience </em> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">(His sinless life</font></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">) and Christ's <em>passive</em> <em>obedience</em> (His atoning death) 
          were altogether sufficient to secure the justification of every repentant sinner who puts his faith in Jesus. 
          Says the apostle, &quot;As One has died for all, then all have died.&quot; 
          2 Cor. 5:14, Moffatt. As far as divine justice is concerned, it can look at the cross of Christ 
          and regard every repentant sinner who puts his faith in Jesus as having died, as having fully satisfied the claims of 
          the law. This is so because Christ is the Substitute for everyone who believes. The believer's justification has been secured. 
          The resurrection of Christ is the proof that God has already accepted 
          and forgiven us in the person of His Son. </font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This  is the gospel !! It is the good news of what God has 
        done in giving us His Son. The empty tomb is the proof that<em> in Christ</em> God has  forgiven our sins

      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This mighty act of reconciliation 
              was provided for us in Christ while we were still ungodly (Rom. 5:6), while we were yet sinners 
              (Rom. 5:8) and when we were still God's enemies (Rom. 5:10).</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. 8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. 10 For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. Romans 5:6-10</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This raises the question, &quot;Did God accomplish our redemption by doing something that was completely outside of us?&quot; 
        Paul's answer is an emphatic Yes! And he proceeds to prove it by contrasting 
        Adam and Christ (Rom. 5:15,19). His point is this: When Adam disobeyed, 
        condemnation and sin passed upon the whole human race. This was so because 
        he was our father. When he fell, everyone fell. Condemnation came upon 
        us not because of what we did, but because of what Adam did (v.18). &quot;For 
        by one man's disobedience many were made sinners&quot; (v.19). Thus we 
        became sinners not by something that happened in us, but by something 
        that happened completely outside of us. God has provided salvation to the race by giving us 
        another Father, even Jesus Christ (Isa. 9:6). Just as all were condemned 
        by what Adam did, justification has been provided and is offered to  all  by what Christ did. &quot;By the 
        righteousness of One the free gift came upon all men unto justification 
        of life.&quot; Rom. 5:19. &quot; For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man's obedience many will be made righteous.&quot; </font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So it is forever 
        certain that the only meritorious ground of acceptance with God is what Christ has 
        already done for us at Calvary. Christ and Christ alone was found pleasing in God's 
        sight. There is one reason for our acceptance with God&#8212;Christ's sinless life and atoning death have been 
        accepted. His obedience of two thousand years ago is the only ground of 
        our acceptance with God today.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As far as God is concerned, at the cross Christ has paid the price of redemption for the entire sinful world  just as surely as Christ has been raised  from the dead and ascended into heaven to present us as faultless before God's throne of grace. At the cross  God has made provision for the redemption of the entire human race in Christ.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...by his own blood He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. Hebrews 9:12</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the light of the gospel, we cannot ask such questions as, 'Will God accept me?&quot; God has answered that question by the resurrection of Christ from the dead. But God confronts the sinner with the question, &quot;Will you accept your acceptance in Christ?&quot; Faith is our saying &quot;Yes&quot; to God. It is accepting the fact that we have been accepted in Christ. By it the blessing of justification and forgiveness is received and enjoyed. This is the subjective aspect of justification. Having saving faith in the shed blood of Christ for our acceptance with God is the only way for the repentant beliving sinner to be assured of the forgiveness of ones sins and eternal life. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus the apostle declares, &quot;A man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.&quot; Rom. 3:28. We are not justified because of or on account of faith. That would be contrary to justification by grace alone and by Christ alone. There is no merit in the faith. It is merely the hand that accepts Christ as our Savior and Lord. Neither can the justified soul take any credit for faith. Apart from grace the sinner has no free will, no desire to seek God, no way of seeing the truth. Here is where the Holy Spirit acts in the matter of justification.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through the proclamation of the gospel, 
          the Spirit brings conviction of sin, of guilt, and condemnation to the heart of the sinner, and then shows him the cross of Calvary and 
          draws him to Christ in repentance for sin. It is the amazing grace and goodness of God revealed to us in the cross of Calvary that leads us to repentance. </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Romans 2:4 ....the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or as the NIV translates the text:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Romans 2:4 .....God's kindness leads you toward repentance.</font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the sinner beholds the One who loved him and died on the cross to pay the price of his redemption, the Spirit persuades the sinner that the gospel is true. So Paul declares, &quot;For by grace 
              are ye saved through faith; and that (salvation) (is) not of yourselves: it 
              is the gift of God.&quot; Eph. 2:8. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, 
        to  not believe is the sin of <em>resisting</em> the Holy Spirit. While the believer 
        can take no credit for faith, the lost must take full responsibility for 
        unbelief. No one is condemned for being born a sinner or for having a 
        sinful nature. Men are condemned only because they believe not (John 3:36). 
        </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and <strong>he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him</strong></font><strong>.</strong> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John 3:36</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus they refuse to be included in Christ's atonement, and by closing 
            their ears against the gospel, they call God a liar (1 John 5:9, 10).    </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is the witness of God which He has testified of His Son.   He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself; <strong>he who does not believe God has made Him a liar,</strong> because he has not believed the testimony that God has given of His Son. 1 John 5:9-10</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the fourth chapter 
        of Romans the Apostle Paul shows how faith is <em>counted</em> for righteousness 
        (Rom. 4:5). God imputes (or reckons) Christ's righteousness to the believing 
        repentant sinner. In this way the sinner is declared to have forgiveness and a right standing with 
        God. The atonement for sin which was fully provided at the cross becomes 
        the repentant believer's personal possession through <em>faith</em> on his part and <em>imputation</em>        on God's part. Faith is <em>counted</em> for Christ's infinite righteousness, not 
        because there is merit in faith, but because faith unites the repentant believer 
        to Christ in whom dwells all the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9). 
        The repentant sinner brings to the union nothing but the disgrace of need; Christ 
        brings to the union all the treasures of eternity. God declares the believer to be forgiven of his sin and accepted into divine fellowship. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justification by faith 
         is not a substitute for obedience, but it becomes a mighty <em>stimulant</em>        for all true obedience. As Paul tells us in Romans 2:4 &quot;Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to <em>repentance</em>?&quot; The repentant soul that appropriates his acceptance in the 
        Beloved is so overwhelmed by divine mercy and love, that his whole life 
        is committed to serve Him who loved him and gave Himself for him. He serves, 
        not in order that he <em>might be</em> accepted and forgiven, but because he <em>has been </em>accepted and forgiven in Christ. 
        He offers his works, not as a <em>sin offering</em>, but as a <em>thank offering</em> in 
        view of sins forgiven. Faith is the powerful progenitor of every good 
        work because it brings the Holy Spirit to dwell in the believer. Faith in Christ's work <em>for us</em>, 
        brings the Holy Spirit to dwell <em>in us</em> (Gal. 3:14; John 7:37, 38). He brings repentance to the believer and then begins to write 
      God's law in the heart (Heb. 10:16), </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15 But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before, 16 &quot;This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the LORD:<strong> I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them</strong>,&quot; 17 then He adds, &quot;Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&quot; Hebrews 10:15-17</font></p>
      </blockquote>                  <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and the believer begins to obey from inward 
          prompting rather than from outward restraint. Thus Paul could say to the Ephesian believers in Acts 20 </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;how I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house, testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, <strong>repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong>&quot; Acts 20:20-21. </font></p>
      </blockquote>            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is the Holy Spirit who empowers the <em>proclamation</em> of the good news of Christ's atoning death to all the world and it is the Holy Spirit who empowers the <em>invitation</em> to all the world to <em>repent </em>and<em> believe</em>. Faith without repentance is not true biblical faith. One of the primary works of the Holy Spirit is to bring conviction of sin, righteousness, and judgment</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8212;</font></p>      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you. And when He is come, He will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: John 16:7-8 </font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">so that we who are by nature dead in trespass and sin might call out, "What must I do to be saved?" Without this <em>drawing</em> of the Holy Spirit and conviction of guilt none of us would ever be drawn to the foot of the cross with groans of repentance for our sins. </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me <strong>draw him</strong>: and I will raise him up at the last day. John 6:44 </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will <strong>draw all men unto me</strong>. John 12:32 </font></p>
      </blockquote>            
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus it is impossible that true faith in Jesus Christ can be a mere mental assent to the truthfulness of the gospel. True faith says, "Christ loved <strong>me</strong>! Christ died <strong>for</strong> <strong>me</strong>! O wretched man that <strong>I am</strong>! It was <strong>my sin</strong> that crucified the Son of God. Lord be merciful <strong>to me</strong> a sinner!!" We come to God just as the poor tax collector came. </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me a sinner!' &quot;I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&quot; Luke 18:13-14 </font></p>

        by Hope</strong></font></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justification by faith 
        brings radical changes in the believer's life (peace, joy, love, regeneration, 
        sanctification, obedience, etc.). Yet in this life it remains that the repentant 
        believer is perfectly righteous only by faith in the imputed, reckoned righteousness of Christ, never by visible reality. It is his 
        faith in Christ's sinless life and atoning death which is counted for righteousness, not his regeneration, sanctification, 
        obedience or Christian character. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Righteousness by faith 
        means that the believer's perfect sinless righteousness is not on earth, but in heaven; 
        not in himself, but in Jesus Christ. Man can never find perfection or 
        fulfillment in himself within the historical process. This is only realized 
        in Jesus Christ. He is not on earth, but in heaven; and 
        the believer possesses perfection and fulfillment only by the unmerited grace of God  through faith  in the sinless life and atoning death of our Lord Jesus Christ credited to the repentant believer.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">True, the believer is given 
        the Holy Spirit as the guarantee or down payment of his inheritance in Christ (Eph. 1:13,

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">but this is only the &quot;first fruits of the Spirit,&quot; the

            of Jesus. The first calls for  faith and repentance; the second calls for  endurance in faith, hope, and love  till the coming of Christ.  Now we possess righteousness by faith in the imputed righteousness of Christ. But
            the believer also waits, groans and presses toward the realization of sinless perfect righteousness in the day of final salvation (Rom. 8:23; Gal. 5:5; 
            Phil. 3:9-12).</font></p>

        of justification by faith has been taught and received, the hope and expectancy 
        of Christ's soon coming has possessed the church. The apostolic church 
        was aflame with the hope of the second coming of Christ. On the other hand, the loss 
        of the truth of justification has led to a corresponding loss of eschatological 
        (last-day) hope. During the Middle Ages, men looked to the church on earth 
        as the expression of human fulfillment. There was no hope in the coming 
        of Jesus. With the Reformation and a revival of the truth of justification, 
        forgiven sinners again began to ardently look for and hope for the coming of Christ. 
        And finally, in these last days the time has fully come for the truth 
        to be restored to its rightful place. The message of Christ's righteousness  and the invitation for all to repent and believe 
        must sound from one end of this earth to the other and thereby make way 
        for the coming of Christ.<br>
