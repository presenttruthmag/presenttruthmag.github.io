<hr size=4 color="#E96F6F"><font size="6" face="Arial Black" color="Maroon">The &#8220;Pentecostal&#8221; and &#8220;Charismatic&#8221; Movement</font><br>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="1-3b.gif" width="200" height="303" align="right"></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has been said that Christianity has two great branches &#8211; Catholic and Protestant. Some are now saying that there are three branches &#8211; Catholic, Protestant, and Pentecostal. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pentecostalism itself is not a denomination, but a rapidly growing religious phenomenon among all major sections of Christendom. Religious commentators are beginning to recognize it as the &quot;third force&quot; in the Christian world. Sometimes called &quot;the Charismatic movement,&quot; it is no longer confined to the small Pentecostal groups as it once was. This activity is becoming quite widespread within the Catholic Church as well as the more conservative Protestant denominations. It can be identified by the experience of speaking in tongues (glossolalia). inter-denominational groups, like the Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International, are very active in spreading the &quot;Pentecostal baptism of the Spirit.&quot; So many charismatic groups are springing up, especially in the youth generation, that this movement has been dubbed &quot;the Jesus Revolution.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The apostle John has this word of wise counsel: &quot;Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.&quot; 1 John 4:1. Following is a six point evaluation of the modern Pentecostal movement: </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        <p><font size="4"><strong>1. Pentecostalism Lacks the Apostolic Emphasis 
          on the Gospel of Christ.</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3">The New Testament accurately records the gospel that was 
        preached by the apostles. They went everywhere proclaiming the good news 
        of what God had done in Christ for the salvation of the human family. 
        In the words of Paul, &quot;God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto 
        Himself.&quot; 2 Cor. 5:19. The message of those early Christians was 
        an exaltation of Jesus Christ. He was God, incarnate in human flesh, who 
        kept the law of God for us. He died for our sins, rose again for our justification and forgiveness, 
        and ascended to the right hand of God for our acceptance and restoration 
        to the Father's favor. Christ Himself, the Representative of the human 
        race, was set forth as the &quot;wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, 
        and redemption&quot; (1 Cor. 1:30) of all repentant sinners who would believe on Him as 
        their Substitute before the bar of eternal justice.</font></p>
      </font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The New Testament also shows that faith in Christ's work 
        for us will bring about dynamic changes in the life of the believer. The 
        Holy Spirit brings repentance, peace, joy and love, as well as various gifts, to those 
        who accept what God has done in Christ for their justification, forgiveness, and salvation. 
        Rough, uneducated fishermen became refined and forceful exponents of the 
        gospel. Cruel persecutors of the followers of Jesus became ardent and 
        loving disciples. Some of the followers of Christ were given gifts of 
        prophecy, healing, speaking foreign languages, etc. Yet with all the spiritual power and 
        gifts that were manifested in the lives of the apostles, they did not 
        go around preaching, magnifying and extolling their experience in the 
        Spirit. Said Paul, &quot;For it is Christ Jesus as Lord whom we preach, 
        not ourselves.&quot; 2 Cor. 4:5, Phillips. Certainly God wants to manifest 
        His sanctifying grace in human lives, but that is not the gospel. That is the result 
        of <em>believing</em> the gospel. The gospel transcends human experience. It is 
        the record about what God has done in Christ for poor, guilty, sinful 
        man. It is something that God did completely outside of us, but nevertheless 
        something that He did for us; and the right believing of this brings repentance, rebirth to the newness of life in Christ, love for God and mankind, and the 
        true experience of salvation in the individual soul.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="3">In Pentecostalism the gospel message of our forgiveness 
        and acceptance in Christ has been subordinated to an emphasis on the personal, 
        subjective experience. The Holy Spirit's work in the believer is its &quot;gospel.&quot; 
        This inverts the whole New Testament emphasis. Instead of really glorifying 
        Christ, it degenerates to the glorification of human experience. When 
        people become preoccupied with what God is doing <em>in</em> them, they lose sight 
        of what God has done <em>outside</em> of them. Whenever men try to reduce Christianity 
        to the dimension of their own human experience, it becomes a cheap, egocentric 
        counterfeit of apostolic Christianity.</font></p>
      </font>      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. The Pentecostal Movement Is  Focused on Subjective 
        Experience Rather Than on the Objective Word of God. </strong></font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Genuine &quot;faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by 
        the Word of God.&quot; Rom. 10:17. Faith does not rest on our experience, 
        no matter how elevating and Spirit-filled that experience might be. Our salvation 
        rests entirely upon Christ's experience for us, just as Isaiah says, &quot;By 
        His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify many.&quot; Isa. 53:11. 
        And the apostle Paul declares, &quot;By the obedience of One shall many 
        be made righteous.&quot; Rom. 5:19. It cannot be stressed too strongly 
        that Bible faith rests upon something that was done entirely outside of 
        us. The Word of God instructs the sinner in the knowledge of Christ's 
        infinitely perfect character, His infinite substitutionary sacrifice on the cross, His 
        triumphant resurrection.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="3">This knowledge of what God has done for him creates faith 
        in the sinner's heart. Faith rests on the certainty of that objective 
        salvation, feeling or no feeling. If the believer feels sinful and destitute 
        of the Spirit, he may still rest in the fact that Christ died for the 
        ungodly. If he is filled with the Spirit and transported to the mountain 
        top of Christian experience, he still knows that his experience cannot 
        save him or recommend him to God.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">In modern Pentecostalism the subjective experience becomes 
        the all absorbing element of religion. In this case people cannot help 
        but build their faith on something inward rather than on something outward. 
        Faith comes to rest on miracles, wonders, feelings, things that the worshiper 
        can sensibly experience. The Pentecostal will try to extol reality and 
        substance, but he confuses the experience of a poor, finite and sinful 
        human being with reality and substance. The truth of the matter is that 
        the only reality and substance that a Christian possesses is what he has 
        by faith in Jesus Christ. A Christian's treasure is in heaven. He is reckoned righteous 
        before God only by faith in the sinless life and atoning death of Christ and shall be saved only by this hope.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">The Pentecostal will say, &#8220;Seeing is believing!&#8221; 
        But subjective experience is no criterion for truth. A true Christian 
        must &quot;live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God&quot;. He must 
        not judge after the sight of his eyes or after the hearing of his ears 
        (Isa. 11:3). He will remember that Jesus said that many would come in 
        His name and show great signs and wonders, and if possible deceive the 
        very elect (Matt. 24:24). The Bible says that in the last days Satan will 
        work with all signs and power and lying wonders (2 Thess. 2:9). In the 
        last judgment many will come to Christ, saying, &quot;Lord, Lord, have 
        we not done many wonderful works?&quot; But Jesus will say, &quot;Depart 
        from Me, ye that work iniquity.&quot; Matt. 7:22-23.</font></p>
      </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4">3. 
        Pentecostalism is More Catholic Than Protestant</font></strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If ever humble, earnest, 
        searching of the Word of God for light and truth were needed, it is now. 
        By the utterances of the Bible, every experience and miracle must be tested. 
        If we trust in our senses, we shall surely be deceived. If we trust our 
        experience, we merit the condemnation of fools, for it is written, &quot;He 
        that trusteth in his own heart is a fool.&quot; Prov. 28:26. There is 
        a constant danger that religious enthusiasts will mistake their whims 
        and impulses as the Holy Spirit, when in reality they are the promptings 
        of the wayward human heart.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Anyone who understands 
        the real principles of struggle in the sixteenth century, will appreciate 
        that Pentecostalism is Roman Catholic in its most fundamental principles. 
        On the other hand, it is clearly contrary to the principles of the great 
        Protestant Reformation. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two aspects 
        of redemption: (1) God's work <strong>for us</strong> in Christ; (2) God's 
        work <strong>in us</strong> by the Holy Spirit. All Christians will subscribe 
        to  these two aspects of man's salvation. The struggle of the sixteenth 
        century was this: Roman Catholicism taught that men could be just in the 
        sight of God on the basis of what God's grace did in their experience. 
        In other words, it based its faith and hope of salvation on Number 2. 
        The Reformers contended that the sole basis of salvation was God's work 
        already accomplished in Jesus Christ. In other words, they based their 
        faith and hope of salvation solely on Number 1. <br>
        <br>
        Between these two great systems of thought there can be no reconciliation 
        or compromise. Men will either have a Catholic relation to God or a Protestant 
        one, and there is no middle ground. The only reason that people today 
        can imagine that the gulf between Romanism and true Protestantism can 
        be bridged is because they have allowed false sentiments and principles 
        to erode their faith. A new generation is arising that has either forgotten 
        or does not care for the mighty Reformation truth of justification by 
        faith.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pentecostalism is 
        doing more than anything else to bring Catholics and Protestants together. 
        But it is not bringing Catholics over to Protestant principles. Rather, 
        it is bringing Protestants over to Catholic principles. This is because 
        Pentecostalism, along with Romanism, places supreme emphasis on God's 
        work of grace <em>in the human heart</em> instead of God's work of grace in Jesus 
        Christ.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It should ever be 
        remembered that the Holy Spirit does not speak of Himself. He comes to 
        glorify Christ, and will use men and women who will cooperate in that 
        great purpose (see John 16:13, 14).<br>
        Pentecostalism makes the &quot;baptism of the Spirit&quot; the end, and Christ only 
        a <em>means</em> to that end. This is an utter perversion of the Bible order. True 
        Christianity has Christ as its center. The believer makes Christ his end, 
        and the Spirit is given him to persevere in that faith. To sinful, fallen, 
        needy men, the gospel presents Jesus as the Pearl of great price, the 
        infinite Treasure of eternity, the fullness of the Godhead bodily, the 
        One who is the righteousness, wisdom, sanctification and redemption of 
        all who believe. The Holy Spirit comes to teach poor, blind men that great 
        and glorious truth. The Spirit never turns the focus of attention away 
        from Jesus and His merit (John 16: 13, 14). When a guilt ridden repentant sinner believes 
        in Jesus, the righteousness of God, the forgiveness of sin, and the accumulated wealth of eternity 
        are all his in Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit is given to the believer 
        as the down payment and guarantee of that great inheritance (Eph. 1:13-14).</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, the Spirit 
        teaches the believer that his Treasure is only in heaven, and that he 
        can never look to any thing or any experience down here as the fulfillment 
        of life. Life can only be fulfilled at the coming of Jesus to receive 
        His own unto Himself; and the Spirit is given to stimulate their love 
        for His appearing and to sustain their hope of His coming (Rom. 8:23-25). 
        Meanwhile they live by faith, and remain righteous and acceptable to God 
        only because their Substitute is wholly pleasing to Him.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>4. Pentecostal 
        Theology Degrades God Into a Popular Somebody.</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Revelation 14 an 
        angel is represented as proclaiming &quot;the everlasting gospel&quot; 
        to every nation on earth. It is important to notice that his first words 
        are, &quot;Fear God, and give glory to Him...&quot; Rev. 14:7. If, as 
        Solomon says, the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, then the modern 
        Charismatic movement is the beginning of folly. This word &quot;fear&quot; 
        means an attitude of reverential awe in view of the unspeakable majesty, 
        power and holiness of God. It is an attitude born of knowing the infinite 
        distance between the holy Creator and the sinful creature, yet at the 
        same time knowing that that distance has been spanned by God's grace in 
        Jesus Christ. Certainly God wants His people to be joyful in His love 
        and mercy, but <em>reverence</em> is the first law of worship. The religion of 
        the Bible does not bring God down to man, but lifts man up to God.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pentecostalism tends 
        to make of God a popular Somebody. Under its influence, people will shout, 
        dance, laugh, and leap for joy, and they are encouraged to do this in 
        the complete absence of faith, repentance, or obedience.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, God says, 
        &quot;Come . . . let us reason together.&quot; Isa. 1:18. The Pentecostal 
        emphasis on the spectacular, the novel, and emotional experience, inhibits 
        man's highest critical faculties and makes it impossible for God to educate 
        the mind to the right kind of thoughts about His character and work.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>5. The Pentecostal 
        Experience Lacks the New Testament Emphasis on Repentance, Faith, and 
        Obedience.</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="FaithandRepentance"></a> In the realm 
        of subjective experience  the true gospel of the Bible places 
        the primary emphasis where the New Testament places it</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&#8212;</strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">on repentance, 
        faith and obedience. Jesus commanded His disciples to preach repentance 
        and faith. Paul preached &quot;repentance toward God, and faith toward 
        our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; Acts 20: 21. Repentance means a godly sorrow 
        for sin. The heart will never experience this unless it becomes sensible 
        of its own moral defilement in the light of God's law.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The majesty, holiness, 
        and justice of God must be presented to the mind of the sinner until he 
        sees something of how offensive and damning is his state of corruption 
        and rebellion in the sight of Infinite Purity. When the sharp arrows of 
        conviction pierce the soul and he becomes terrified with the thought of 
        appearing before God in his sin, then the soul is ready to hear the good 
        news of God's saving love in Jesus Christ. The message of the cross does 
        not lessen the sense of sin, but deepens it, for in the light of the terrible 
        suffering of the Savior, the sinner sees how grievous sin appears in God's 
        sight.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the working of 
        the Spirit upon his heart, he begins to hate sin for what it is, and longs 
        for that purity and righteousness unto which he is powerless to attain. 
        The Spirit not only gives him repentance toward God for breaking His law, 
        but also faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. This faith is not a mere opinion 
        about the historical Jesus, but it is a trusting response of the whole 
        life to Jesus Christ. The repentant sinner, claiming no merit of his own, 
        comes into the presence of a holy God presenting nothing but the merits 
        of a crucified and risen Savior, claiming nothing except that Christ stands 
        as his Substitute.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">True faith will bring 
        forth the fruit of obedience to the whole will of God, to the whole law 
        of God, the Ten Commandments. Faith is the seed or root of obedience because it acknowledges 
        the lordship of Jesus Christ over the whole life. These are the primary 
        graces <em>imparted</em> by the Holy Spirit: repentance, faith and obedience. The 
        wondering crowd will be more enamored and impressed with spectacular things, 
        like miracles and tongues. A circus is more pleasing to carnal hearts 
        than self-renunciation, sorrow for sin, and faith that will be manifested 
        in obedience to all the commandments of God.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><img src="1-3a.gif" alt="Pentecostals" width=264 height=467 border=0 align="right">6. Pentecostalism Represents Love (<em>Agape</em>) As an Emotional Experience.</strong></font> </p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The divine <em>agape</em> love of the New Testament is not a sentiment or emotion, but a heaven-born principle. Pentecostalism presents love as a rapture or feeling that is enjoyed in the believer's heart. The Bible presents love as a principle of unselfish concern for others. These two concepts are as different as night is from day.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The one who accepts the Pentecostal experience will do things because the &quot;love&quot; in his heart makes him feel like doing it. He may even quote Paul, who says, &quot;The love of Christ constraineth us.&quot; The one who accepts the principle of Bible love will do things whether he feels like doing them or not. In fact, in the matter of duty, his feelings will not even be consulted. His first concern is God's glory, and he will obey Him even if it runs contrary to his own feelings and impulses. He will keep God's law at the expense of personal convenience or even life itself. He will do this because he has made Jesus first and last and best in everything. Furthermore, he will serve and seek to benefit his fellow men. He may not have a strong emotional feeling toward them. He may not like some of them. But he will love them as souls for whom Christ died.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pentecostalism is a sensual &quot;love&quot; experience. Many who have participated in it testify that the experience is similar to a sexual experience. Instead of getting &quot;high&quot; on drugs, many are taking up the motto, &quot;Get high on Jesus.&quot; Instead of being the work of the Holy Spirit, it is often the work of the spirits of devils who stimulate the sensual organs of the brain. Bible prophecy foretells that this phenomenon is going to grow throughout the Christian bodies until the religious world becomes &quot;the hold of every foul spirit, and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird.&quot; Rev. 18:2. Yet a remnant, armed with the Word of God, shall escape the grand delusion that will unite the Catholic and so-called Protestant worlds. This remnant is described in Revelation 14:12: &quot;Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.&quot;</font></p>

        Concord on the Eucharist</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The doctrine of transubstantiation 
        has long been a source of friction and division between the Roman Catholic 
        Church and the Church of England. To the Catholic, this teaching means 
        that the bread and wine consecrated in the service of the Mass are changed 
        in form, or &#8220;transubstantiated, &#8220; into the very blood and 
        flesh of Christ. The Anglican, on the other hand, has believed that these 
        elements of the Communion service are symbols or memorial of Christ&#8217;s 
        sacrificial offering for the sins of men.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A significant document has 
        been released jointly by dignitaries of the two churches. It signified 
        that a consensus of belief on the Eucharist has been reached. This document, 
        entitled Agreed Statement on Eucharistic Doctrine, reveals that the Anglican 
        Church has officially come over to the Catholic opinion on this teaching 
        of Christianity. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The statement proclaims that 
        &#8220;communion with Christ in the Eucharist presupposes his true presence, 
        effectually signified by the bread and wine which, in this mystery, becomes 
        his body and blood,&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is another ecumenical 
        &#8220;straw in the wind&#8221; which portends further ideological union 
        in the future. One Church of England official commented on this accord: 
        &#8220;[It is] the most important doctrinal pronouncement made between 
        official representatives of the two churches since the Reformation.&#8221;</font></p>
