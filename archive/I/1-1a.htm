            <img src="1pg3.gif" alt="" width=576 height=287 border="0">            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&quot;Behold, 
              I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great 
              and dreadful day of the Lord.&quot; Mal. 4:5.</strong></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The central truth of 
              the New Testament message is the justification and acceptance of 
              sinful man by the saving activity of  God. God the Father 
              saves the sinner by His grace through the gift of His beloved Son. 
              God the Son saves him by His life that was poured out through the 
              shedding of His precious blood. And God the Holy Spirit makes it 
              all effectual by giving men faith and repentance through the hearing of the gospel. As Paul tells us, &quot;I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house,  testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; Acts 20:20-21</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This glorious New Testament 
              light was obscured and almost lost in the ages that succeeded the 
              apostles. Then, in the great Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth 
              century, the truth about man's justification and acceptance with 
              God through faith in the imputed righteousness of Christ was rekindled from the writings of St. Paul. It blazed its way 
              through Western civilization with such tempestuous fury that it 
              changed the course of history.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the more than four 
              hundred years that have passed since the birth of the Reformation, 
              forces have been at work to dilute the power of the mighty Reformation 
              truth. Protestant liberalism has turned poor, sinful man back upon 
              the resources of his own puny wisdom. Evangelical radicalism has 
              turned a multitude after seeking satisfaction in pious religious 
              experience.<br>
              <br>
              Pentecostalism and the so-called Charismatic Movement are leaving 
              their millions to wallow in the delusive frenzy of spiritual subjectivism. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Renaissance has probably 
              been the biggest <strong>Pied Piper</strong> of all, leading a vast horde of humanity 
              down the road toward the mirage of a scientific utopia. And religious 
              conservatives  have often been so 
              engrossed in daubing the monuments of their hoary creeds that they 
              have forgotten to keep alive that Reformation spirit which constantly 
              engaged itself in distinguishing between tradition and truth.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus this age of boasted 
              &quot;enlightenment&quot; has turned man back to depend on his own resources 
              just as effectively as did past ages of darkness and superstition. 
              Just as those times of ignorance were favorable to the development 
              of the papacy, so this age of knowledge is proving favorable to 
              the rapid spread of agnostic humanism and papal principles. Protestantism in general has 
              lost her identity. As she falters in her path and scans her uncertain 
              future, she favorably casts her eyes back to Rome from whence she 
              came.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In words of great certainty 
              and clarity, the ancient prophet declared that God would send Elijah 
              before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord (Mal. 
              4:5). And Jesus said, &quot;Elias [Elijah] truly shall first come, 
              and restore all things.&quot; Matt. 17:11. Although this prophecy 
              met its initial fulfillment in John the Baptist, who prepared the 
              way for Jesus' first advent, it is clear that an Elijah message 
              must precede the second advent of Jesus Christ. What is the nature 
              of this &quot;Elijah&quot; movement &quot;before the coming of the 
              great and dreadful day of the Lord&quot;? It is to restore all things. 
              The faith and purity of apostolic Christianity is to be restored. 
               Then Jesus Himself shall come, not as a Lamb to bear 
              the sins of many, but as King to bring salvation unto them that 
              earnestly look for His coming (Heb. 9:28).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such a message and movement, 
              sent of God to restore all things in readiness for the coming of 
              Jesus, is clearly brought to view in the fourteenth chapter of the 
              Revelation. It is represented by the flying apocalyptic angel:</font></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;And 
                I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting 
                gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every 
                nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud 
                voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment 
                is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the 
                sea, and the fountains of waters. ... And I looked, and behold 
                a white cloud, and upon the cloud One sat like unto the Son of 
                man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp 
                sickle.&quot; Rev. 14:6, 7, 14.</font></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is no sectarian 
              invention, but a divine restoration. This is no denominational innovation, 
              but an Elijah restoration. The gospel, once delivered to the saints, 
              is again redefined and given with distinct utterance. Then the Eternal 
              shall roll up the scroll of time and summon men before His throne 
              to give account of their response to the gospel of His grace.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Word of God mentions 
              many signs of Jesus' coming and the end of the world (see Matt. 
              24 for instance). Most of these signs have already been fulfilled. 
              Yet the greatest sign is the restoration of the pure message of 
              the New Testament. This restoration will carry the glorious work 
              so nobly begun by the Reformers, to its final consummation. The 
              world is ripe for this final restatement of the everlasting gospel. 
              Once again everything is ready to hear the declaration of God's 
              righteousness, &quot;that He might be just, and the justifier of 
              him which believeth in Jesus.&quot; Rom. 3:26. The sword of truth, 
              newly edged with power and bathed in the lightnings of heaven, will 
              cut its way through the vanity of all human dependencies and once 
              again confront man with the reality of God's saving activity in 
              Jesus Christ.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The publishers and sponsors 
              of this magazine are committed to the vision of a full restoration 
              of New Testament Christianity. Nothing more is needed. Nothing less 
              will do. They have nothing left in this world aside from this hope, 
              and nothing worthwhile to do outside the context of this commission.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And now, dear reader, 
              we salute you with the words of the king of Israel: &quot;Is thine 
              heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?&#8221;. . .If it be, 
              give me thine hand.&quot; 2 Kings 10:15.</font></p>
