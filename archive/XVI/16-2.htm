<FONT SIZE="6" FACE="Arial Black" COLOR="Maroon">Sanctification&nbsp;&#8212; Its Definition</FONT><br><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you take a concordance and start noting how <em>sanctify, sanctification, holiness </em>and related words are used, the first thing which may strike you is the various ways in which these words are used. To start with, <em>sanctify</em> is used in reference to a variety of objects. It may be applied to <em>places</em> (the camp of Israel, the hill of Zion), to <em>time</em> (the Sabbath, the fiftieth year), or to <em>people</em> (the firstborn, the priests, the congregation or individual people). It is also quite evident that the word <em>sanctification</em> has different shades of meaning. For instance, <em>sanctification</em> may mean any of the following:<br>

<br>

<strong>1.</strong>  A <em>completed</em> act, as when God sanctified Jeremiah before he was born or the seventh day at creation (Jer. 1:5; Gen. 2:2,3).<br>

<br>

<strong>2.</strong>  A <em>process</em>, as when the Hebrews were exhorted to follow holiness or the Corinthians to perfect holiness (Heb. 12:14;2Cor. 7:1).<br>

<br>

<strong>3. </strong>A <em>status</em> that is possessed or enjoyed (1 Cor. 1:2).<br>

<strong><br>
4. </strong>An <em>experience</em> and way of life to practice (1 Thess. 4:3-7)<br>

<br>

Louis Berkhoff, the late Reformed scholar, notices four distinct uses of the words <em>sanctification</em> and <em>sanctify</em> in the New Testament:<br>

<br>

<strong>1. </strong>It may mean to regard as holy (1 Pet. 3:15; Matt. 6:9).<br>

<br>

<strong>2. </strong>It may mean to ritually separate for holy use, such as in Matthew 23:17, 19.<br>

<br>

<strong>3.</strong>  It may mean expiation from defilement, as used in the book of Hebrews.<br>

<br>
<strong>4.</strong>  It may be used in accordance with the most commonly accepted theological use, i.e., &quot;. . . that operation of God by which He especially, through the Spirit, works in man the subjective quality of holiness.&quot; &mdash; Louis Berkhoff, <i>Systematic Theology</i> (London: Banner of Truth, 1971), p.527.<br>

<br>

Other scholars may contend for some other uses or shades of meaning. The reason why we point this out by way of introduction is to avoid falling into needless theological combat over one particular meaning and ending up like the blind men arguing whether an elephant felt like a spear, a rope or a wall&nbsp;&#8212; depending upon which part of the elephant's anatomy each one chanced to touch.<br>
</font>
<ul>
      
  <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so these men of Indostan<br>
      
Disputed loud and long,<br>
      
Each in his own opinion<br>
      
Exceeding stiff and strong,<br>
      
Though each was partly in the right,<br>
      
And all were in the wrong!
    </font>
</ul>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most scholars are agreed that the words <em>sanctify</em>, <em>sanctification</em>, <em>holiness</em>, <em>holy</em>, etc., come from Hebrew and Greek words which basically mean <em>to set apart or to separate.</em> Says R.C. Trench, &quot;Its fundamental idea is separation, and so to speak, consecration and devotion to the service of Deity.&quot; &mdash; R.C. Trench, <em>Synonyms of the New Testament</em> (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans), p.331.<br>

<br>

This action of <em>separation</em> or <em>setting apart </em>has two aspects:<br>

<br>
<img src="16pg04b.gif" alt="" width=443 height=367 border="0" align="right"><strong>1.</strong>  It means separation <em>from</em>. Abraham was separated from Chaldea and from his father's home. Israel was separated from Egypt. The Christian church is called to separate from the world. (&quot;Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord...&quot; 2 Cor. 6:17.) And finally, the faithful worshipers are called to separate from apostate religion. (&quot;... Come out of her, My people. . .&quot; Rev. 18:4.)<br>

<br>
<strong>2.</strong>  Sanctification not only means separation <em>from</em> sin, but a separation <em>to</em> a new life. Abraham was separated <em>from</em> Chaldea <em>to</em> become the friend of God. Israel was separated <em>from</em> Egypt and consecrated <em>to</em> the service of Yahweh. Believers are purged <em>from</em> dead works <em>to</em> serve the living God (Heb. 9:14). Those who are justified by faith are &quot;delivered <em>from</em> the law&quot; <em>to</em> &quot;serve in newness of Spirit.&quot; Rom. 7:6.<br>

<br>
So on the one hand <em>sanctification</em> means separation <em>from</em> sin, <em>from</em> unholy fellowship, <em>from</em> the abomination of the heathen, <em>from</em> the world and its allurements, <em>from</em> the ways of the ungodly. And on the other hand it means separation <em>to</em> a life of obedience to God, <em>to</em> fellowship with Him, <em>to</em> devotion to His glory and service. Thus, as Trench observes, the word <em>sanctification</em> (and related words) &quot;speedily acquires a moral significance.&quot; &mdash; Ibid., p.332.<br>

<br>

In theology <em>sanctification</em> has generally come to mean that process of becoming or being made holy. It is true that the New Testament does not use the actual word <em>sanctification</em> very frequently to describe this process, but the concept is nevertheless very prominent. Besides calling it <em>sanctification</em>, the New Testament uses other expressions which describe this important process. Here are some of them:<br>



<ul>
      <strong>1. </strong>Following after righteousness (1 Tim. 6:11).<br>
      
  <br>
      
  <strong>2.</strong>  Walking in newness of life (Rom. 6:4).<br>
      
<br>
      
<strong>3.</strong>  Being transformed (Rom. 12:2).<br>
      
<br>
      
<strong>4.</strong>  Perfecting holiness in the fear of God (2 Cor. 7:1).<br>
      
<br>
      
<strong>5.</strong>  Growing up into Christ (Eph. 4:15).<br>
      
<br>
      
<strong>6. </strong>Pressing toward the mark (Phil. 3:14).<br>
      
<br>
      
<strong>7.</strong>  Being built up in the faith (Col. 2:7).<br>
      
<br>
      
<strong>8.</strong>  Partaking of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4).<br>
      
<br>
      
<strong>9. </strong>Growing in grace (2 Pet. 3:18).
</ul>
It is often helpful if a writer or speaker defines his terms at the outset of his presentation. When we use the word <em>sanctification</em> in this treatise, we are using the word in its commonly accepted theological connotation. The following definitions of well-known scholars are representative of what we intend to mean by <em>sanctification</em>:<br>
