        B.D*.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font>      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No one can seriously deny the rapid 
        spread of the charismatic,<sup>1</sup> or neo-Pentecostal, movement over 
        the last couple of decades. <em>Christianity Today</em> had this to say about this 
        phenomenon:</font>
        <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The force that appears to be 
        making the greatest contribution to the current Christian revival around 
        the globe is Pentecostalism. This movement, which began several decades 
        ago, and which in its early years was very sectarian in character, is 
        now becoming ecumenical in the deepest sense. A neo-Pentecostalism has 
        lately appeared that includes many thousands of Roman Catholics. . A new 
        era of the Spirit has begun. The charismatic experience moves Christians 
        far beyond glossolalia. ... There is light on the horizon. An evangelical 
        renaissance is becoming visible along the Christian highway from the frontiers 
        of the sects to the high places of the Roman Catholic communion. This 
        appears to be one of the most strategic moments in the Church's history."&mdash;<em>Christianity 
        Today</em>, Feb. 4, 1972, p. 8.</font> 
      </ul>


      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This type of statement is rather 
        typical of the many comments on this movement which has made and continues 
        to make colossal strides into every corner of Christendom.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Out of the 
        Womb of Last-Century Revivalism</font></B></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A historical blood test will show, 
        beyond dispute, that the charismatic, or neo-Pentecostal, child comes 
        from the holiness movement of the last century.</font>
<ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"John Wesley was father to much 
        of the 19th century American religious fervor; one of his children was 
        the Holiness Movement which gave rise to the Pentecostalism of the 20th 
        century."&mdash;Kilian McDonnell, "The Classical Pentecostal Movement," <em>New 
        Covenant</em>, Vol. I, No. 11 (May, 1972). p.1. (<em>New Covenant</em> 
        is a monthly publication serving the Catholic charismatic renewal.)</font> 
      </ul>


      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bruner cites the Pentecostal 
        historian, Charles Conn, who also affirms this historical descent, saying, 
        &quot;... the Pentecostal movement is an extension of the holiness revival 
        that occurred during the last half of the nineteenth century."&mdash;Quoted 
        in Frederick Dale Bruner,<em> A Theology of the Holy Spirit</em> (Grand 
        Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1970). p.44.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Family Squabble 
        and Subsequent Leaving Home</font></B></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The child of the holiness movement 
        was a black sheep of the family who now appears to have the privilege 
        of painting the rest of the family.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dominant emphasis of the holiness 
        movement of the last century (and its twentieth-century successors) was 
        "the victorious and Spirit-filled life." Its focal point was the attainment 
        of "an infilling experience," a degree of "surrender" which resulted in 
        an uninhibited walk with God. Boardman, Inskip, A. B. Simpson, R. A. Torrey, 
        Andrew Murray and Hannah W. Smith were some of the leading figures in 
        this movement.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Towards the end of the nineteenth 
        century, some within the holiness movement began to speak about &mdash; and 
        to seek for &mdash; a "baptism of fire." This baptism of fire was seen as a 
        miraculous visitation of the Holy Spirit. Opposition arose from those 
        who regarded two blessings as quite sufficient! Despite such opposition, 
        the "advocates of fire" continued to make an impact on the rest of the 
        family with publications such as <em>Live Coals of Fire </em>(first published 
        in October, 1899). which spoke of "the blood that cleans up, the Holy 
        Ghost that fills up, the fire that burns up, and the dynamite that blows 
        up." The explosion took place eventually, and the Pentecostal child came 
        into the world insisting on the physical sign of speaking in tongues as 
        the evidence of the baptism in the Spirit.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important at this stage to 
        emphasize that though the tongues issue caused the split in the family, 
        resulting in the leaving home of the Pentecostal child, the basic underlying 
        theology of the two groups was and is the same. Harold Lindsell quite 
        rightly says:</font>
<ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">". . . members of these groups 
        [Keswick movement, the holiness movement and other deeper-life movements] 
        believe in the infilling of the Holy Spirit, believe that every Christian 
        should be so filled, and believe there are conditions the believer must 
        meet in order to have this experience. Many of them have had an infilling 
        experience and are convinced that they are in no way inferior in their 
        daily walk to those whose baptism has been accompanied by tongues-speaking."&mdash;Harold 
        Lindsell, <em>Christianity Today</em>, Dec. 8, 1972, p.9.</font> 
      </ul>

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Family Reunion</font></B></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Pentecostal descendant 
        grew in stature outside the family for some sixty years and was seen by 
        Dr. Henry Van Dusen (Union Theological Seminary) as the "third force" 
        in Christendom. Then about 1960, in the words of John Sherrill (<em>They 
        Speak With Other Tongues</em>). "the (family] walls came tumbling down." 
        At first hundreds, and then thousands, and now millions, of Episcopalians, 
        Methodists, Lutherans, Baptists, Presbyterians and Congregationalists 
        began to be painted by the hitherto separated and somewhat outcast brother. 
        The reunited brethren have become known as the neo-Pentecostal, or charismatic, 
        movement. This neo-Pentecostal, or charismatic, force has become a transdenominational 
        phenomenon which, though functioning outside the structures of traditional 
        Pentecostalism, is in basic agreement with it.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some members of the (deeper 
        life, holiness movement) family refused &mdash; and still do refuse &mdash; to be 
        painted. They disclaim any allegiance with this vociferous brother and 
        usually concentrate on the superficial differences, such as liturgical 
        conduct ("dancing before the Lord," etc.) or even speaking with more than 
        one tongue. Such, in the words of Lindsell already quoted, "are convinced 
        that they are in no way inferior in their daily walk to those whose baptism 
        has been accompanied by tongues-speaking." This may well be the case, 
        but there is also a certain embarrassment at the rather breathtaking growth 
        of these brethren.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why did big brother make such an 
        impact on the family? Why are scores of folk from evangelical churches 
        (to say nothing of the many non-evangelical churches) "going over" to 
        the ranks of this movement? This question has not received anything like 
        the ventilation that it deserves as far as this writer is concerned.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Big Brother 
        Leads the Family to Rome via Duquesne and Notre Dame</font></B></font>
<ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Within a month, what 
        had begun at Duquesne spread to the university of Notre Dame and to the 
        Catholic student parish of Michigan State University. From these three 
        centers it spread further. Soon people were speaking of a 'Pentecostal 
        movement' in the Catholic Church."&mdash;Edward 0. O'Connor, <em>The Pentecostal 
        Movement in the Catholic Church</em> (Notre Dame: Ave Maria Press, 1911), 
        pp.15, 16.</font> 
      </ul>      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So writes the scholarly Benedictine, 
        Edward O'Connor, concerning the beginnings and spread of the charismatic 
        phenomenon within the ranks of the Church of Rome.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do the respective groups 
        (non-Catholic charismatics and Catholic charismatics) view this inroad 
        into the Church of Rome? Generally,<sup>1</sup> the non-Catholic neo-Pentecostals 
        see the inclusion of Rome as a sign that God has decided to forego His 
        denominational allegiances with a show of great power. Gelpi speaks of 
        the Pentecostal phenomenon as having ". . .shown no respect for denominational 
        boundaries. And with the appearance of Roman Catholic Pentecostalism, 
        the movement may have achieved something like an ultimate."&mdash;Donald L. 
        Gelpi, <em>Pentecostalism: A Theological Viewpoint </em>(New York: Paulist 
        Press, 1971). p.33.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rev. Thomas A. White, in a circular 
        letter to priests from the Catholic Enquiry Centre in Sydney, Australia, 
        had this to say:</font>
<ul><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"My conclusion, for what it is worth, is that the Catholic Pentecostal Movement holds great promise for genuine renewal within the Church. Its power to revitalize the faith of many Catholics (particularly young people) is quite remarkable. its possible ecumenical value is far reaching."</font></ul>


      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kilian McDonnell, in his work, 
        <em>Catholic Pentecostalism: Problems in Evaluation</em>, says:</font>
<ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Within Catholicism Pentecostalism 
        has met with considerably less resistance than it has within the historic 
        Protestant churches, partly because the concept of the 'wondrous' is more 
        at home in Catholicism than in mainstream Protestantism." &mdash;Kilian McDonnell,<em> Catholic Pentecostalism: Problems in Evaluation</em> (Pecos, N. Mex.: Dove 
        Publications, 1 970, p.31.</font> 
      </ul>


      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">McDonnell is not the only one who 
        sees (what he inaccurately terms) "Pentecostalism" as having deep affinities 
        with the spirituality of Rome. O'Connor makes no bones about asserting 
        the same:</font>
<ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Although they derive 
        from Protestant backgrounds, the Pentecostal churches are not typically 
        Protestant in their belief, attitudes or practices." O'Connor,<em> op. 
        cit</em>., p 23.</font> 
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">". . . it cannot be 
        assumed that the Pentecostal movement represents an incursion of Protestant 
        influence."<em> ibid</em>., p.32.</font> 
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">". . . Catholics who 
        have accepted Pentecostal spirituality have found it to be fully in harmony 
        with their traditional faith and life. They experience it' not as a borrowing 
        from an alien religion, but as a connatural development of their own." 
        <em>Ibid</em>., p.28.</font> 
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Moreover, the doctrine 
        that is developing in the Pentecostal churches today seems to be going 
        through stages very similar to those which occurred in the early Middle 
        Ages when the classical doctrine was taking shape." &mdash;<em>Ibid</em>., pp.193, 
        194.</font> 
      </ul>      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would not be wide of the mark 
        to say that, if the next quotation from Fr. O'Connor is correct, neo-Pentecostalism 
        ought to be heralded by the Vatican as a revival of the truest and best 
        of her religion:</font>
<ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Similarly, the traditional 
        devotions of the Church have taken on more meaning. Some people have been 
        brought back to a frequent use of the sacrament of Penance through the 
        experience of the baptism in the Spirit Others have discovered a place 
        for devotion to Mary in their lives, whereas previously they had been 
        indifferent or even antipathetic towards her. One of the most striking 
        effects of the Holy Spirit's action has been to stir up devotion to the 
        Real Presence in the Eucharist"&mdash;Edward D. O'Connor, <em>Pentecost in the 
        Catholic Church</em> (Pecos, N. Mex.: Dove Publications, 1967), pp.14, 
        15.</font> 
      </ul>

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earlier we raised a question 
        regarding the impact of neo-Pentecostalism on evangelical Christians. 
        We must now ask further questions. Is the experience the same in both 
        Catholic and non-Catholic circles? Is this the same Spirit which led the 
        Reformers to regard so much that is basic to Catholicism as a disastrous 
        deviation &mdash; indeed, negation &mdash; of the gospel of grace? These questions, 
        like the questions raised earlier, ought to receive serious consideration 
        by all who are concerned for truth. Lindsell speaks of a painful plight 
        (<em>loc cit</em>., p.11) of Catholics who have been regenerated and who 
        have spoken with tongues, but where is this plight being seen? The plight 
        seems to be that there is little plight being experienced by so many who 
        are Catholics and "Spirit-baptized" at the same time.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">"Victory-Life," 
        Pentecostalism and Romanism &mdash; Fundamental Affinity?</font></B></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We emphasized previously that 
        there is an underlying agreement between so much of evangelical holiness 
        teaching and Pentecostalism. We have also seen how some avant-garde Roman 
        theologians are bent on stressing the fundamental affinity between Pentecostal 
        spirituality and that of Rome. We now propose a third point of investigation: 
        Is it possible that there is a direct (though underlying) affinity between 
        so much evangelical "victory-life" spirituality and classic Roman Catholic 
        spirituality? The noted Catholic author, Louis Bouyer, has claimed as 
        much:</font>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The Protestant Revival 
        . recalls the best and most authentic elements of the Catholic tradition. 
        ... "&mdash;Louis Bouyer, <em>The Spirit and Forms of Protestantism</em>(Cleveland: 
        World Publishing Co., 1964), p.186.</font> 
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We see in every Protestant 
        country, Christians who owed their religion to the movement we have called, 
        in general, Revivalism, attain a more or less complete rediscovery of 
        Catholicism." &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>., p.188.</font> 
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">". . . the instinctive 
        orientation of the revivals toward the Catholic .. would bring in that 
        way a reconciliation between the Protestant Movement and the [Roman] Church. 
        ..." <em>Ibid.</em>, p.197</font> 
      </ul>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <P>Bouyer closes with an appeal to his fellow Catholics to prepare for the inevitable 
        return of the separated brethren under the influence of contemporary revivals.
      <P><B><font size="4">The Australian Forum and <em>Present Truth Magazine</em></font></B>
      <P>The Australian Forum came into being a little over twelve months ago. It is 
        a nondenominational group dedicated to the gospel of grace alone as it 
        is expounded in the New Testament and reaffirmed by the Reformers in the 
        sixteenth century.
      <P>The main activity of the Australian Forum since its inception has been the 
        conducting of forums in every major city of Australia, in Auckland, New 
        Zealand, and in Seattle, Portland, Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles, 
        Denver and other places in the U.S. These forums have taken the form of 
        presentation of papers and dialogue following.
      <P>The official organ of the Australian Forum is a magazine called <em>Present 
        Truth Magazine</em>, which, over the past dozen months or so, has gone 
        out, free of charge, to hundreds of thousands of readers. <em>Present 
        Truth Magazine</em> is directed to Christian leaders mainly in the hope 
        that it may provoke thought and fruitful action for the gospel.
      <P>Why did the Australian Forum come into being? It came into being because 
        it firmly believes that there is only one gospel, which is the gospel 
        of grace alone, and because it fears this gospel is being lost in an avalanche 
        of religious emotionalism and subjectivism in our day. The forum believes 
        that there is a basic affinity between the following pairs: <strong>(1)</strong> much victory-life 
        piety-Pentecostalism (both traditional and neo);<strong> (2)</strong> Pentecostalism-Romanism; 
        <strong>(3)</strong> much victory-life piety-Romanism.
      <P>The Australian Forum believes that, essentially, O'Connor of Notre Dame is 
        correct in affirming the essentially non-Reformational character of Pentecostalism 
        and its deep affinities with the medieval spirituality of Rome. The forum 
        also believes that Louis Bouyer is correct, not so much in his optimism 
        concerning "the inevitable return of the separated brethren," but in his 
        aligning of much of revivalistic-type Christianity with the "most authentic 
        elements of the Catholic tradition."
      <P>The Australian Forum has sought never to enter into cheap and uncharitable 
        polemics. The emphasis, from the beginning, has been on attempting to 
        make clear the objective gospel of the <em>aliena justitia Christi</em> 
        and to measure present-day claims against it. The forum has sought to 
        stress (albeit imperfectly) what Lindsell has called "the heart of the 
        salvatory process" (Lindsell, <em>loc. cit</em>, p.11). Though it has 
        sought to challenge the charismatic movement on the relationship between 
        its claims and the gospel, it has also sought to stir evangelicalism into 
        a fresh look at its understanding of sanctification.
      <P>It is easy to be cheaply anti-Roman, and the Australian Forum &#8212; whether 
        or not it has succeeded &#8212; has sought to avoid such. Much earnest and sincere 
        discussion has taken place with Roman Catholics in order to discover their 
        opinion of the basis of fellowship. The experience of the members of the 
        forum has been that the "baptism in the Spirit" all too often looks like 
        it is being made the basis of such fellowship, with the tragic brushing 
        aside of the fundamental doctrinal question.<sup>2</sup> It would be wrong 
        to suggest that Protestant neo-Pentecostalists are less prone to do this 
        than their Catholic brethren, for such is not at all the case.
      <P>The Australian Forum believes that the question of theology is the central 
        question, and its forums and magazine have therefore been dedicated solely 
        to theological considerations:      </font>      <P><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1.</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The fundamental nature of the gospel as the authoritative declaration of 
          what God has done in and through Jesus Christ, has been stressed over 
          and over again. Negatively, the forum has stressed that the gospel is 
          not at all primarily concerned with what God is doing in the believer. 
          Testimony, therefore, is testimony to the objective (historical) realities 
          of the <em>kerugma</em>. The pulsating heart of the New Testament is the Lordship 
          of Jesus Christ over sin, demonstrated in forgiveness for the believing 
          subject and decisive defeat for the devil and his cosmic henchmen. The 
          New Testament writers never left this fact, nor ought we. Ethics are the 
          explication and application of this fact for the individual and collective 
          existence of the believer.
      </font>      
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;
      </font>      <P><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2.</strong></font><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Australian Forum has again and again sought to make clear that 
          at conversion &#8212; itself a work of the gospel &#8212; the believer receives all 
          that God has to give him in this life, save, of course, increased understanding 
          of what has taken place and what will most assuredly take place at the 
          parousia. The notion of "receiving Christ" &#8212; an unfortunate expression 
          smacking of man's cherished autonomy &#8212; and then, at some subsequent stage, 
          receiving the Spirit of His "fullness," is seen by members of the forum 
          as a flagrant &#8212; though no doubt unintentional &#8212; distortion of the Biblical 
          presentation. Needless to say, this is a challenge to much victory-life, 
          Pentecostal, neo-Pentecostal and Catholic "subsequence theology."

      </font>      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">3. </font></strong>The Australian Forum has sought to represent what it firmly believes to 
          be the New Testament concept of the Christian life. The Christian life 
          is one of unrelenting conflict (Gal. 5:17) until Jesus comes to "change 
          our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body" (Phil. 
          3:21). To deny this, explicitly or implicitly, and to offer release here 
          and now, is to rob the Christian of his hope. The reason for the <em>parousia</em>        meaning so little to so many for so long, might well be here&mdash;in the offer 
        of here-and-now fullness by countless propagators of a totally un-Biblical 
      "victory."

      <P>A great deal of work needs to be done in the area of empirical piety and the 
        relation of such to the "new man" of the New Testament. To put. it another 
        way, the concept of the "changed life" needs serious revision in the light 
        of the teaching of the New Testament. Take the example of General Ralph 
        E. Haines, Jr., quoted by Lindsell:
      <ul>
        <font size="2">"what has the baptism of the Holy Spirit done for me? I 
        think it has made me a better man, a better husband, and more understanding 
        of my fellow man. I am much more excited by prayer and Bible study&mdash;and 
        I believe more perceptive in both. I am a far stronger witness for Jesus 
        Christ. . ." &mdash;<em>Ibid</em>., p. 9. </font> 
      </ul>
      <P>Now for a question: Could the reader imagine Paul saying the same sort 
        of thing &mdash; "The Spirit-baptism has made me aware of being better [man, 
        husband], more understanding [of others], more perceptive and a stronger 
        witness"? Does Lindsell realize the import of what he writes when he says:
      <ul>
        <font size="2">"Many of them [members of the Keswick, holiness and other 
        deeper-life movements] have had an infilling experience and are convinced 
        that they are in no way inferior in their daily walk to those whose ..." 
        <em>ibid.</em> </font> 
      </ul>
      <P>Does the infilling of the Spirit produce such an awareness of one's spiritual 
        worth? Members of the Australian Forum would like to suggest that the 
        opposite is more likely to be the case. One would realize how poor a husband 
        he is, etc. (cf. Rom. 3:27; 1 Cor. 1 :26-31).
      <P>Sanctification, the Australian Forum has sought to stress, is not justification 
        superseded but justification in action. Sanctification is the gospel peeping 
        through the unpretentious existence of the one who has been confiscated 
        by the Lord of glory. Nor is sanctification "a moment-by-moment freedom 
        from sin" in the sense of "having none of it" and "not doing any of it." 
        Sanctification is an ever-increasing awareness of just how much of sin 
        we do have and how much of it we, in actual fact, do! This is always one 
        of the great needs of the Christian, for we are naturally predisposed 
        to find our sinfulness in thought and deed quite incredible. Of one thing 
        we may be quite sure &#8212; the Spirit will never diminish our awareness of 
        sin; we will always want to say, "O wretched man that I am," and, under 
        the same Spirit's leadership, go on to greater awareness of what grace 
        means! Hence, "O wretched man that I am! ... thank God. ... &quot;is always 
        the cry of the maturing Christian.
      <P>Bad theology is the cause of all our dilemmas. From whence comes this 
        bad theology? Some would like to answer, "From incompetent preachers and 
        teachers." It must follow that this is the case. In what, however, does 
        such incompetency consist? The Australian Forum feels that it can give 
        but one fundamental answer to this question: "A failure to handle the 
        Bible in a satisfactory manner." Herein lies what could well be the greatest 
        need of the evangelical church of God today. We do not know, countless 
        thousands of sincere believers do not know, how to read the Bible. We 
        are talking here of that ugly-sounding word <em>methodology</em>. We all 
        have one, but it is having the correct one that is needed. The Australian 
        Forum, with all its imperfections, has sought and is seeking to make a 
        contribution towards a clear grasp of the gospel, which is the power of 
        God for healthful existence.
