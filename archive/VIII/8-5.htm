      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong>Editorial Note:</strong><font size="2"> 
      P.T. Forsyth was an English theologian who is best known for his passionate 
      concern with the theology of the atonement, and with vital Christian experience 
      in contrast to formal religion. His contention was that the battle for New 
      Testament Christianity must be waged to the end. We here reproduce excerpts from his work entitled <em>Christian Perfection</em>.<sup>1</sup> 
      Although we may not subscribe to all that Forsyth has written, we can appreciate 
      his keen insight into the Biblical concept of perfection, especially in 
      view of false "holiness" theology so prevalent today. </font></font>

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Statements like these texts seem 
        to be met with every kind of contradiction:</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the first place, there is the 
        contradiction offered by John himself. "If we say that we have no sin, 
        we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the next place, there is the contradiction 
        offered by our own experience. We know that we sin as surely as we know 
        our life in Christ.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And our own experience is only enlarged 
        by what we know of the experience of greater saints than ourselves. The 
        history of holiness is a record of self-abasements on daily cause. It 
        is a story of triumph and joy, but it is a daily humiliation all the same, 
        and a real, concrete humiliation; not a vague and sentimental self-accusation, 
        but a definite self-indictment as the fruit of a serious self-examination.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, texts like these 
        seem in contradiction with the very nature of faith itself.... To say 
        "I have now no sin" is to give up that relation to God which is the essence 
        of faith, and to stand upon a new and subtle kind of legalism. The man 
        who says that tries to enter on a relation to God which is higher than 
        faith, and therefore he falls out of faith. . . The very nature of faith 
        is trust of a Saviour, who is not the saviour of my past but of my soul; 
        and it is trust for forgiveness, for forgiveness not only of the old life 
        but of the new.... grace is not simple benediction, but blessing as the 
        fruit of incessant forgiveness.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is a fatal mistake to think 
        of holiness as a possession which we have distinct from our faith, and 
        conferred upon it. That is a Catholic idea still saturating Protestant 
        pietism. . . Penitence, faith, sanctification, always co-exist; they do 
        not destroy and succeed each other. . . . Faith is always in opposition 
        to seeing, possessing, experiencing. . . . It is not our experience of 
        holiness that makes us believe in the Holy Ghost. It is a matter of faith 
        that we are God's children; there is plenty of experience in us against 
        it. That we are justified and reborn is a matter of faith. . . . To claim 
        sinlessness as the perfect state superseding faith is to fall from faith, 
        not to rise from it. It is because we have sin that we believe &mdash; as belief 
        must go in a religion whose nature is forever revealed as Redemption. 
        Our perfection is not to rival the Perfect, but to trust Him. Our holiness 
        is not a matter of imitation but of worship. Any sinlessness of ours is 
        the adoration of His. The holiest have ever been so because they dared 
        not feel they were. Their sanctity grew unconsciously from their worship 
        of His. All saw it but themselves. The eye is the beauty of the face because 
        it sees everything but itself; and if it betray self-consciousness the 
        charm is dimmed. The height of sinlessness means the deepest sense of 
        sin. If we ever came to any such stage as conscious sinlessness we should 
        be placing ourselves alongside Christ, not at His feet. . . . We should 
        be self-sufficient. We should cease to live on a constant look to God 
        in Christ, and repentance would cease. We should be near the fall that 
        so often comes to the sinless. We should be in the moral peril of those 
        who, feeling they have attained this sinlessness, are ready to call each 
        impulse good and lawful, as born from the Spirit with which they are now 
        possessed.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Perfection is not sinlessness.</strong> 
        The "perfect" in the New Testament are certainly not the sinless. And 
        God, though He wills that we be perfect, has not appointed sinlessness 
        as His object with us in this world. His object is communion with us through 
        faith. And sin must abide, even while it is being conquered, as an occasion 
        for faith. Every defect of ours is a motive for faith. To cease to feel 
        defect is to cease to trust. To cease to feel the root of sin would be 
        to have one motive the less to cast us on God for keeping.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Where does the solution of these 
        contradictions lie?</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John himself believes in two 
        kinds of sin, and both of them are possible to the believer. "There is 
        a sin unto death . . . and there is a sin not unto death" (1 John 5:16, 
        17). It was a distinction current in the Old Testament, and it explains 
        much in the New, where it is deepened. The sin unto death is when a man 
        falls entirely out of communion with God. He loses the life of God from 
        his soul permanently &mdash; I do not say eternally. He has not Eternal Life 
        abiding in him. The world conquers him. The habit of his mind becomes 
        earthly. . . . That is the sin unto death. And the sin not unto death 
        is every transgression which still leaves the habit and sympathy of the 
        soul for God a living thing. There are lapses which a man by vigilance, 
        repentance, prayer, and well-doing can repair. Sin is a region he may 
        visit, but it does not become his element. He falls into sin, but not 
        into godlessness. . . . Every believer has more or less of this sin in 
        him, and the risk of it always. But it does not cut him off from the divine 
        life. There is a daily confession, a daily forgiveness, a daily cleansing 
        of the channels of the grace of God.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Cannot sin" means not that he is 
        not able to sin, but that his principle will not allow him to sin. As 
        the regenerate personality he cannot do it. He may, of course, be at the 
        same time something other than the regenerate personality in his actual 
        condition so far. But in so far as he is the servant of that personality 
        he cannot. "You cannot do it," we say to a man, not denying the physical 
        possibility, as if he were paralyzed or in jail, but denying the moral 
        possibility. . . Ideally, whoso is born of God cannot sin. That is the 
        absolute truth. That is a judgment of faith as distinct from a judgment 
        of experience. It arises from what we know of God, of Christ, not of human 
        life. . . John concludes from Christ to man as the normal man in Christ 
        should be, as Christ alone is. It is not a logical but a Christological 
        judgment.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is the thing most deep and assertive 
        in him [the professed believer]? I mean, what is most continuous in him? 
        I do not ask what asserts itself oftenest, but what asserts itself most 
        persistently on the whole, and in the end most powerfully and effectively. 
        What is the real and only continuity of his life? Is it a sinful temper 
        and bias, a sinful joy or indifference, broken only occasionally, and 
        ever more rarely, by spasms of goodness, glimpses of holiness, freaks 
        of mercy and truth? Or is it the sympathy and purpose of holiness, clouded 
        at times by drifts of evil, and cleft, to his grief, by flashes of revolt? 
        That is the question. And it is the way the question will be put at the 
        last. It will not be, How many are your sins and how many your sacrifices? 
        but, On which side have you stood and striven, under which King have you 
        served or died? A man may abide in the many-mansioned, myriad-minded Christ, 
        even if the robber sometimes break into his room, or if he go out and 
        lose his way in a fog. You stay in a house, or in a town, which all the 
        same you occasionally leave for good or for ill. The question is, What 
        is your home to which your heart returns, either in repentance or in joy? 
        Where is your heart? What is the bent of your will on the whole, the direction 
        and service of your total life? It is not a question settled in a quantitative 
        way by inquiry as to the occupation of every moment. God judges by totals, 
        by unities not units, by wholes and souls, not sections. What is the dominant 
        and advancing spirit of your life, the total allegiance of your person? 
        Beethoven was not troubled when a performer struck a wrong note, but he 
        was angry when he failed with the spirit and idea of the piece. So with 
        the Great Judge and Artist of life. . . . Perfection is not sinlessness, 
        but the loyalty of the soul by faith to Christ when all is said and done. 
        </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We may be essentially parted from 
        our sin while yet it hangs about us. The constitution is renewed, but 
        the disease recurs in abating force. The new nature asserts itself over 
        the head of reactions. We lust for the fleshpots of Egypt, and we return 
        upon our tracks and move in a circle; but it is, after all, but a loop 
        upon our larger line of onward march. The enemy is beaten, though he makes 
        guerilla raids and carries off something we deplore. Our progress is a 
        series of victories over receding attacks which sometimes inflict loss. 
        And the issue turns on the whole campaign, not on a few lost battles.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Sanctity 
        and Faith</font></B></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Every man perfect in Christ Jesus" 
        (Col. 1:28). "Complete in Him" (Col. 2:10). Christianity is the perfect 
        religion because it is the religion of perfection. It holds up a perfect 
        ideal, it calls us incessantly to this ideal, and it calls all to this 
        ideal. Each man is called, and each man is always called, to it. . . . 
        [but] the means of reaching this perfection for us sinners is not achievement 
        but faith.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christianity is not the perfect religion 
        in the sense of being revealed as a finished, rounded, symmetrical whole. 
        It is not perfect in the sense of a closed circle, or a plastic form, 
        which can be altered in nothing without being spoiled. That is the Greek, 
        pagan idea of perfection; whereas in Christianity we enter into perfect 
        life maimed. The pagan idea of perfection is balance, or harmony of parts 
        with each other. It is self-contained and self-poised. The Christian idea 
        is faith, or harmony of relations with the will and grace of God. It is 
        self-devoted, complete in Him; the perfection not of finish but of faith. 
        It is perfect, not because it presents us with perfection, but because 
        it puts us in a perfect attitude to perfection. Our perfection is not 
        some integrity which we possess, in the sense in which the Vatican possesses 
        the faultless Venus, or Christ's infallible Vicar. The one is as pagan 
        in its idea of perfection as the other. . . . But Christian perfection 
        is something which we are put in the perfect way to realize, in the sense 
        that we realize a living, moving ideal of character and life. . . it is 
        something into which we are redeemed. The perfection of Christianity is 
        not even in the ideal of perfection it offers, but in the power of perfection 
        it implants; not in its ideal of a Son of God, but in the power it gives, 
        with the Son of God, to become sons of God by believing in His name.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two notions of perfection 
        which are wrong, and a third which is right. But all three are right compared 
        with the notion that we are to wait for perfection till some indefinite 
        time in the infinite future. All three urge that Christian perfection 
        is a condition of actual, living people in this world. It is a religion, 
        a faith; it is not merely a hope.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first idea is <strong>Pietist</strong>; 
        the second is <strong>Popish</strong>; the third is <strong>Protestant, 
        Apostolic, Christian.</strong></font>
      <P><strong><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong>The Pietist idea</strong> 
        pursues perfection as mere quietist sinlessness with a tendency to ecstasy. 
        Its advocates are people sometimes of great grace and beauty; but it represents 
        a one-sided, narrow, and negative spirituality. Its religion is largely 
        emotional, mystical, and introspective. Its adherents are apt to be the 
        victims of visions and moods. They seek perfection in a state of sinlessness. 
        It is a condition largely subjective, ascetic, anaemic, feminine. It prescribes 
        an arbitrary withdrawal from the interests, pursuits, and passions of 
        life. It is a cloistered virtue.... There is an absence of true humility.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">2.</font></strong> <strong>The Popish idea</strong> 
        of perfection has much in common with the Pietist. It is unworldly in 
        the negative sense; it flees from the world, it does not master it. It 
        is embodied in the monk and the nun. In the Roman system the monk is the 
        ideal man, the nun the ideal woman. These stand on the summit of moral 
        and spiritual greatness. They are likest Christ. They obey Christ most 
        perfectly.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The whole Roman system rests on the 
        double morality involved in this distinction. It is a religion by double 
        entry. It teaches that only some are called to perfection, while for the 
        majority the demands made are much more ordinary. . . . There are thus 
        two grades or morality, two classes of men, two moral standards set up 
        inside Christianity and inside the race. All are not alike before God. 
        And all are not called to perfection in Jesus Christ; only a minority, 
        only an aristocracy of Christians are. . . .</font>
      <P><strong><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Protestant idea</strong> 
        of perfection is the possession of the righteousness of God. And the righteousness 
        of God, in the New Testament idea, is something which is a gift of God 
        to us, and no achievement of ours before Him. It is a justification of 
        us, a righting of us, effected by Him, and on our side appropriated by 
        the obedience not of conduct but of faith. On the human side, indeed, 
        it is faith, which is held by God to be our righteousness, our true adjustment 
        to the ultimate moral reality, which is Christ. In faith we are in the 
        right and perfect relation to God. But God's justification of us is a 
        perfect and complete thing. In faith, therefore, we possess the perfect 
        will of God concerning us. We enter on a full salvation. We have as ours 
        the fulness of Christ. The Roman theology knows only of a perfection, 
        a righteousness, which is an acquisition, which is always growing and 
        never there, which is not complete in the act of union by living faith, 
        but must always be eked out by the sacraments and the obedience of the 
        Church. There is, indeed, a true sense in which the perfection even of 
        faith grows. It becomes actual in life and practice; but that adds nothing 
        to the perfection which is ours in the incredible salvation which we take 
        home by supernatural faith. Faith is implicit; what is explicit is experience. 
        We but unfold a perfection which is in God's sight there, we do not accumulate 
        a perfection which we are always striving to place there. The queen and 
        mother of all the virtues is not our subjection and obedience to the Church. 
        Implicit faith in anything institutional is usurped faith. The true faith 
        is implicit in Christ, in Whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and 
        knowledge. Faith is in its nature obedience, but it is the will's obedience 
        to Christ. This is the root and mother of virtue; this is the new life 
        with the promise and potency in it of all the perfection which may become 
        actual in us by any sanctification. Our sanctification only unfolds in 
        actual life the ideal perfection in which we really stand by faith in 
        Christ. And yet this ideal perfection, being of pure and free grace, is 
        not the vision foreseen by God of our moral effort's final success. But 
        it is the finished and forgone gift of God in Christ through our faith, 
        and the thing which alone promises the final success of any moral efforts. 
        In giving Christ He gave us all things&mdash;i.e. perfection. It is not our 
        moral success that is presented as perfection to God even in anticipation; 
        it is God's present to us of perfection that makes morral success possible.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The error at the root of all false 
        ideas of perfection is this: it is rating our behavior before God higher 
        than our relation to God&mdash;putting conduct before faith, deeds before trust, 
        work before worship. That is the root of all pharisaism, Romanism, paganism, 
        and natural and worldly morality.</font>

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He [Christ] has been so treated as 
        our perfect example that His outward fashion of life has been copied at 
        the cost of His inward principle. . . . our faith and fellowship in Christ 
        is worth far more for our perfection than any effort to live up to Him 
        as our example &mdash;useful as that may be. We are complete Him, not merely 
        by His help but by His indwelling it is better to trust Christ and His 
        work than even imitate Him. He is worth infinitely more to the world as 
        its Savior than as its model, as God's promise than as man's ideal. He 
        is more to be admired than copied, more to be loved than to be admired, 
        and e is to be trusted more than all. This trust of Christ the highest 
        thing a man can do. Trust become habitual is our new nature, our perfection 
        made perfect, our life and abiding in Him.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Christ bids us be perfect as 
        our Father in heaven is perfect, He does not tell us to do what the Father 
        does. The Father makes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends 
        rain on just and unjust. We cannot do that. We cannot affect sun or rain. 
        We cannot copy God. He is Almighty as we are not. . . We are not told 
        to do what God does, but as He does. is sympathy that is wanted more than 
        imitation. What we are to imitate is the love and grace of God. And there 
        is only one way of imitating that, only one way of learning it. It is 
        by trusting Him. Love is learned by faith in the case of the unseen. With 
        our visible lovers faith may come by love. With the Lover our souls love 
        comes by faith. Love of the unseen the girdle of perfectness which is 
        put on over the other garments of faith and hope and all the virtues, 
        and after them, as the last touch which keeps them all in form and place. 
        . . . in the main, when the New Testament speaks of the perfect, it means 
        not the compete but the spiritually adult; not the fully sanctified but 
        the duly justified. They are not people who perfectly love, but who truly 
        trust. They may be defective as yet in many points of character, or relations 
        to each other. But they have entered on the right relation to Christ. 
        They are not all ideal characters. Some are not even beautiful. But they 
        will become so in time or eternity. They have started on that career. 
        They have come to spiritual adultness by faith in Christ. . .</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know the difference between a 
        youth and an adult. There is a step taken in life, a step hard to describe 
        and various in its ways, by which the boy passes into the man, the girl 
        into the woman. They are held fit for a share in things to which they 
        were not admitted before. They become initiates in life where before they 
        had been novices. . . . When St. Paul says, "We speak wisdom among the 
        perfect," he meant that he was talking as he would to spiritual men and 
        not to hobbledehoys. . .</font>

        the soul. It is the soul coming to itself, coming of age, feeling its 
        feet, entering on its native powers. Faith is perfection in this sense. 
        It is not ceasing to grow, but entering on the real and normal region 
        of growth. . . . Growth is then progress, not to Christ, but in Christ.

        you may call the Petrine, the Pauline and the Johannine stages if you 
        will. A man is perfect when he comes to belong to Christ instead of himself. 
        . . We are perfect in Christ, and in Him continually more so. In Christ 
        we are what we are to be&mdash;not in the sense in which a closed figure is 
        all it can be, but in the sense in which the perfect seed has the promise 
        and power of the perfect tree. . . . In faith we are not panting, and 
        straining, and rending ourselves after a perfection only ideal, possible, 
        remote, and ever receding. We are not toiling to put achievement on the 
        head of achievement, or mortification on the back of mortification, to 
        reach heaven. That is a war of godless giants, which ends in failure, 
        defeat, and chagrin. But we are unfolding a perfection which we already 
        have in fee. We are appropriating what is already ours. We are sure that 
        it is ours before it is ours. It is in us before it is on us. We have 
        it with Christ before we have it with men. We are complete in Him before 
        He completes Himself in us. We are perfect, and yet we are not perfect. 
        We are as having nothing and yet possessing all things. We are in Christ, 
        therefore we are complete; but we are in the world too, therefore we are 
        not complete, but only on the way to completion. . . . It is a perfection 
        which both is and grows. True perfection is the power of perfect growth. 
        But that does not mean unbroken growth. There are times when we lie becalmed, 
        times when we have to tack, times when the current carries us astern, 
        times when we are buffeted out of the straight course&mdash;when it is much 
        if only we can keep at sea and not go to pieces on the rocks. Ignorance 
        misleads us. Our charts fail us. Our crew mutinies, our passions take 
        command, for a time. But, on the whole, we are on the living way. The 
        master passion and bias of the soul is to Christ. The ruling will is the 
        will of God, however certain impulses escape its control. We may still 
        sin, but we are not sinners. Sin clings, soils, and may sometimes master. 
        There are lapses, repentances, renewed forgivenesses. True perfection 
        is not the power of unbroken growth, but of growing unto perfection, growing 
        on the whole. . .</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We do not read that we are bidden 
        to aim at any of the absolute qualities of God. That would be the old 
        temptation, "Ye shall be as gods." How near the devilish suggestion lies 
        to the divine, temptation to inspiration, "Be as gods" to "Be ye perfect." 
        Our perfection is not to be rival absolutes, but to love and trust the 
        absolute. Be as perfect in your relative way as God is in His absolute 
        way, which contains all relatives. . .</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. . . take as . . . [an] illustration 
        the Great Redemption itself which His obedience wrought. It was completed 
        in His death. It was finished. Having died unto sin once, it was once 
        for all. That death and conquest needs no repetition. . . . The whole 
        work was in principle done, the everlasting victory was in spirit won. 
        In the spiritual world the Cross is one long indubitable triumph of conclusive 
        bliss. . . . What Christ did was a thing for ever complete and sufficient. 
        Redemption is the condition of the world in God's eternal sight, and with 
        it the perfect God is well pleased. . .</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But in your sight, actually, historically, 
        is it a redeemed world? To your faith it is; viewed from this house, from 
        this day, from this worship, from this pulpit, it is. It is so really, 
        but is it actually? To your sight is it a redeemed world?. . . Where is 
        Redemption in current affairs, in the course of past history, in the record 
        even of the Church itself? It is so hard to see, that if we look away 
        from the Cross we may not perceive it at all. . . . Yes, Redemption is 
        finished and unfinished, complete in heaven, incomplete on earth. Incomplete 
        on earth, with eternal promise and power. Imperfect but no fiasco. We 
        are complete in Him in whom His own work is always complete. .. . Our 
        one perfection is to be in Him. He will perfect Himself in us in His time. 
        . . . We have a perfect Redemption, however imperfectly redeemed we are 
        at any one stage. In faith we are what we can never feel ourselves to 
        be. We are by faith what we are not, but are ever growing by grace to 
        be.</font>

        <font size="4"> R&eacute;sum&eacute;</font></strong></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would end by resuming the more 
        practical and experimental features of perfection. . .</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. . . our perfection must be a limited 
        one. It is not possible for any Christian at any one time to fulfil all 
        possible duties and realize all possible excellences. Your perfection 
        lies in what is possible to you with your character and position, in what 
        you are called to be and do, in what lies on your conscience, in what 
        concerns the situation in which you find yourself in life. . .</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The features of Christian perfection 
        are these. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, <em>faith</em>. . . 
        . By faith I do not mean only that utterly inward transaction in which 
        the soul forgets the world and deals with God, committing itself to Him 
        in a high, spiritual, mystic, rapturous act. It is not the fine frenzy 
        of religious emotion, the glow of exalted adoration and surrender. That 
        may be in it, but that is not necessarily of it; it is not its test. There 
        is a better test of faith than rapture. It is confidence, patience, and 
        humility. . . . It [faith] is filial trust in God's love, redemption, 
        and providence amidst the duties, affections, pleasures, enterprises, 
        perils, fears, guilts, gains, losses of active life. . . . It rests on 
        an experience of Jesus Christ and God's grace in Him. It rests in God 
        amid much ignorance; though we do not know the future, and do not understand 
        the past. . . . It consists more of obedience and quiet confidence than 
        of visions. And at the last it approves itself better (as I say) in humility 
        and patience than in ecstasies....</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Humility</em> is a frame 
        of perfect mind not possible except to faith. It is no more depression 
        and poverty of spirit than it is loud self-depreciation. It rests on our 
        deep sense of God's unspeakable gift, on a deep sense of our sin as mastered 
        by God, on a deep sense of the Cross as the power which won' that victory. 
        . .</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With humility goes <em>patience</em> 
        as a supreme confession of faith.... It [patience) is a way of doing work&mdash;especially 
        the true secret of not doing too much work. It is a way of carrying success. 
        It is not renouncing will and becoming careless. It is an act of will. 
        It is a piece of manhood. To part with will is to become a thing. It is 
        not mere resignation or indifference &mdash; which often goes with despair and 
        not faith. It is a form of energy, even when it curbs energy. .</font>
<ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I am ready not to 
        do<br>
        At last, at last." </font></ul> 
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both humility and patience 
        are only Christian in the spirit of <em>thankfulness</em>. Faith is for 
        the Christian enveloped in praise. It is no gloomy humility, no sombre 
        patience, no dull endurance, no resentful submission. It is all clothed 
        with hope. . . . Whatever we offer to God, were it life and health itself, 
        is offered in the name of Christ, in sequel to His Cross, as the joyful 
        response to our redemption there. . .</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next feature of perfection 
        is <em>prayer</em> &mdash; prayer as a habit, joy, and prize of life. Humility 
        takes the form of reverence and yet communion. The heart converses with 
        God in Christ. It offers thanks, it confesses sin, it makes its petitions, 
        but it above all converses with God. That is the inmost energy of faith 
        &mdash; prayer. It is faith's habit of heart. All acts of prayer become but 
        expressions of this habit Work goes to this tune. Everything rises to 
        God's throne. Everything the child does has a reference to the father, 
        direct or indirect. Every form of prayer is speech with God the Father 
        and Redeemer. . . . </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A further feature of Christian 
        perfection is <em>duty</em>. Humility takes shape as devotion to the will 
        of God in the natural and social order that holds us. It is daily duty 
        in our relations and calling. If it is a calling God cannot bless, it 
        is not for you. If He can bless it, it is a contribution to Him. . . </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the last feature of Christian 
        perfection is <em>love</em>, and especially love to man. I have spoken 
        of love to God, that may be a passion. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God 
        with all thy heart, soul, strength, and mind." But the love of man is 
        less so. It is at least less of an emotion than a principle, and especially 
        a principle of action. "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." But 
        self-love is not an emotion so much as a principle, a habit of mind and 
        action. So with the love of men. When will the public learn that that 
        is not necessarily.a tenderness of mood or manner? . . . Love is not mere 
        natural benevolence. It is not easy compliance. . . . Its type is rather 
        the family love that grows up unmarked as a part of us than the passionate 
        love of man and woman, which we fall into, and which seizes us with a 
        mighty hand. It is a principle and habit of heart and conscience, a frame 
        or temper of life which steadily desires the welfare of men, and especially 
        their salvation, as if it were our own....</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You cannot trust His [Christ's] 
        love and righteousness without gaining the disposition to trust love and 
        justice above all things everywhere. <em>Why do so few people in Christendom 
        really trust love as the ruling power in mankind? Because Christ is not 
        for them a real personality, loving and loved; because they have been 
        taught to seek Christian perfection in the completeness of some institution, 
        or the maintenance of some law, or the fever about some conviction. </em></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Something Christian is the 
        object of their enthusiasm more than Christ. . . . What we need is the 
        personal impression of Christ, the personal sense of His cross, the fresh, 
        renewing, vitalizing, sweetening contact of His soul in its wisdom, its 
        tenderness, its action for us&mdash;and all so freely for us, so mercifully, 
        so persistently, so thoroughly. What we need is the touch, the communion 
        of that kind of perfection. We need to realize how in the Cross the defeat 
        of that sort of goodness is really its victory, its ascent to the throne 
        of the world. The Ruler of the world must be the consummation of the world. 
        The Judge of all the earth must be the Law of all the earth. And the law 
        of all must be the secret of all its harmony and perfection.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You must let that come home 
        to you, to your own peculiar case. To be perfect with God you must have 
        Christ come home, come HOME, to you and sit by your central fire &mdash; come 
        home to you, to YOU, as if for the moment mankind were centred in the 
        burning point of your soul, and you touched the burning point of God's. 
        You must court and haunt His presence till it break forth on you, and 
        it becomes as impossible not to believe as to believe is hard now. Then 
        we realize what we were made for, made to be redeemed; we lay hold by 
        faith of our destiny of perfection in another; we are already in spirit 
        what it is latent in redemption that we shall be &mdash; what some curse in 
        our nature seemed before to forbid and thwart our being. Our dry rod blossoms. 
        We put forth buds one after another along the line of life. We grow into 
        a stately, seemly tree, whose boughs are for shelter and whose leaves 
        are for healing. Our pinched hearts expand, our parched nature grows green. 
        The fever of life is cooled. Its fret is soothed. Its powers stand to 
        their feet. Its hopes live again. Its charities grow rich. We feel in 
        that hour that this is what we were made for, and we are sure that we 
        are greater than we know. We find ourselves. We lose our load. We are 
        delivered from our plague. Our weakness is made strong. Our enemies flee 
        before us. Our promised land is round us. Life beckons where it used to 
        appal. And all things with us are returning, through Christ, to the perfection 
        of God from whom they came.</font>
