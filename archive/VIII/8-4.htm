              <font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="8-4.gif" alt="Praise the Lord" width=432 height=327 border=0 align="right">Jack D. Zwemer, D.D.S., Ph.D.</font> &nbsp;            
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not possible to 
                understand the problem posed by Pentecostalism without briefly considering 
                the nature of a Christian man. Like all other men, the Christian 
                man possesses a carnal nature that is utterly and hopelessly vile, 
                unclean, impure and unrighteous. But unlike other men, the Christian 
                man also possesses a spiritual nature. This nature is wholly clean, 
                pure and righteous.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus the Christian is 
              at the same time both clean and unclean, pure and impure, righteous 
              and unrighteous. In such a man there rages an unrelenting conflict 
              between his two natures. &quot;For the flesh lusteth against the 
              Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh . . . so that ye cannot 
              do the things that ye would.&quot; Gal. 5:17.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Steadfast Christians 
              should recognize that this conflict continues without remission 
              all through this mortal life. At the end as well as at the beginning, 
              they are accepted in the Beloved &mdash; solely through what the Saviour 
              has done for them. They live by faith in His merits and in hope 
              of final release from the conflict when Jesus shall come to &quot;change 
              our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body&quot; 
              (Phil. 3:21). </font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Down through the centuries 
              there have always been those to contend, however, that a Christian 
              may ultimately attain release from the conflict in this life through 
              the full eradication of the carnal nature by the work of the Holy 
              Spirit in him. Such exponents believe that they need not always 
              occupy the mourner's bench, content with the righteousness which 
              they have in Christ in heaven, but may eventually reach the choir 
              loft and sing of the righteousness which they have within themselves.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are the apostles 
              of the &quot;victorious life,&quot; the &quot;second blessing,&quot; 
              the &quot;baptism in the Holy Spirit.&quot; They are the spiritual 
              kindred to the holiness movement which swept America and England 
              in the last century.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite all its claims, 
              the holiness movement had a problem. How could final Christian victory 
              be certainly attested to the believer himself and to his brethren? 
              How could one be sure that the carnal nature indeed had been wholly 
              vanquished? Subjective experience and testimony alone could be questioned 
              and doubted and, on the other hand, readily counterfeited.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For those on the fringes 
              of the holiness movement in the nineteenth century, this problem 
              was resolved by &quot;spiritual gifts,&quot; or manifestations, 
              such as holy clapping, shouting, laughing, shaking, barking, dancing 
              or rolling, which witnessed to the inner experience. These demonstrations, 
              however, were such crude excesses that they belied the victorious 
              life rather than confirming it.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was not long, therefore, 
              until these earlier &quot;gifts&quot; were supplanted by the &quot;gift&quot; 
              of unknown tongues, which ostensibly had a firmer Scriptural basis 
              and provided more authentic evidence of the believer's condition.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To its devotees, the 
              gift of tongues symbolized a higher plane of spiritual attainment 
              which transcended the testimony of the Word of God to them and firm 
              reliance on the objective work of Christ for them. The gifts of 
              the Spirit were more coveted than the fruits of the Spirit. And 
              while faith sufficed for Christian initiation, it had to be 
              coupled with a variety of works to achieve the &quot;second blessing&quot; 
              &mdash; the &quot;baptism in the Holy Ghost.&quot;</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rather than constituting 
              the &quot;full&quot; gospel, these pretensions are nothing but a 
              perversion of the gospel. They presume to take the very righteousness 
              of God in heaven, accounted to man, and actually compress it into 
              a puny, fallen human vessel. Thus they cast the truth to the ground.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the face of this terrible 
              fallacy and many blatant and persistent indications of personal 
              carnality, the movement survived and increased in vigor from its 
              beginning at the turn of the century. Since the Scriptural gift 
              of tongues was granted the apostles on the day of Pentecost, when 
              the Holy Spirit was poured on the infant church, the modern tongues 
              movement assumed the name, &quot;Pentecostal.&quot;</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 1960, numerous Pentecostal 
              bodies had extended from America throughout the world, had claimed 
              more than eight million members and had become, in the words of 
              Henry P. Van Dusen, &quot;the great third force in Christendom.&quot;</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The vigor and vitality 
              of the movement then attracted both leaders and laymen in mainline 
              Protestant churches alarmed over the dead orthodoxy of their communions, 
              the spiritless tokenism of the social gospel, and their own deep 
              spiritual declension.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 1960, the tongues 
              and the so-called baptism in the Holy Spirit have invaded all the 
              Protestant bodies. Millions, both of clergy and laity, have embraced 
              the phenomenon in the neo-Pentecostal, or charismatic, movement. 
              It has achieved new respectability to become the most pervasive 
              and potent force in modem Protestantism.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then, in 1967, neo-Pentecostalism 
              penetrated the bastions of Rome. In Catholicism the charismatic 
              movement has been met with open arms. It is regarded as the fulfillment 
              of the medieval mystical ideal of Thomas Aquinas. It is hailed as 
              the new Pentecost promised by Vatican II. It is extolled as the 
              great ecumenical dream of the church. This very year it has been 
              lauded at the Eucharistic Congress in Melbourne, Australia. It will 
              also provide considerable impetus to the greatest evangelistic outreach 
              America has yet seen, under the slogan, &quot;Key '73.&quot; In 
              this endeavor, Roman Catholics and more than 130 Protestant denominations 
              are united under the chairmanship of the Assemblies of God president, 
              Thomas Zimmerman.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile the charismatic 
              movement has already moved beyond the pulpit and the pews into the 
              highways and byways of the earth. Here it has met and captivated 
              the youth culture and generated much of the now famous Jesus Revolution. 
              Thousands of youth in America and elsewhere who once turned on to 
              drugs and to sex are now turning on to Jesus with ecstatic tongues.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Soon it seems that all 
              the world will be swept into this delusive wonder. Of multitudes 
              revelling on the street corners over their supposed deliverance 
              and new found experience and powers, it can be said, &quot;Verily 
              ... They have their reward.&quot; Hidden from human eyes, the Christian 
              man will be in his closet, crying, &quot;God be merciful to me a 
              sinner!&quot; This man will go down to his house justified.</font>
