            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The truths of divine revelation are full of paradoxes. There appear to be many contradictions in the Bible. This is because truth can very often be expressed to the human mind only by two statements which appear to be antithetical.</font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much harm is done when men seize only one side of the paradox and teach that as if it were the whole truth. Others feel that they can easily &quot;harmonize the apparent contradictions.&quot; Failing to appreciate that the full truth is a paradox, they bend one side of the paradox to &quot;harmonize&quot; with the other. This results in a distortion of the message of God's Word. Have you ever looked into a mirror which throws a distorted image of your figure? All your features may be there, but they are thrown out of proportion.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Systematic theology may 
                have its place, but there is a real danger in reducing the varied 
                and paradoxical aspects of infinite truth to a rigid system of human 
                logic.</font>
              
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us illustrate these 
              principles with some concrete examples from the Word of God:</font>
            <P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. Fear and Confidence</strong></font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bible writers commend 
              that spirit which fears God and trembles at His Word (see Isa. 66:5; 
            Phil. 2:12; Rom. 11:21-22; Heb. 4:1; Rev. 14:7). </font>            
            <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isaiah 66:5  Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; . . .</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Romans 11:21-22 For if God did not spare the natural branches, He may not spare you either. 22 Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness. Otherwise you also will be cut off. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Philippians 2:12    Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Revelation 14:7  Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. </font></p>
            </blockquote>            
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They also exhort us to approach 
                God boldly with fearlessness: </font></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Let us therefore come boldly unto the 
                      throne of grace....&quot; Heb. 4:16</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Having therefore, brethren, boldness 
                        to enter....&quot; ; Heb.10:19.</font> </p>
            </blockquote>            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a paradox. We 
              are admonished to live before God with fear <em>and</em> fearlessness, trembling 
              <em>and</em> confidence. Luther, perceiving the truth of the paradox, said 
              that the Christian must live in a sort of &quot;desperate confidence.&quot;</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider the serious 
              distortion that will result from only stressing one side of the 
              paradox. The timid soul, distrustful of self, needs the assurance 
              that the great King on the eternal throne opens wide His everlasting 
              portals to the trembling touch of a little child. On the other hand, 
              the confident clamor of the presumptively pompous self-righteous individual need to be confronted 
              with the truth that reverence and godly fear are the first law of 
              worship. Our God is awful in majesty, holiness and sin-hating purity. 
              We must not dare to approach Him with any careless familiarity or 
              to make of Him a popular somebody. We remember what Luther said 
              about some of the radical spirits of Wittenberg. &quot;They talk 
              to God,&quot; complained the Reformer, &quot;as if He were a shoemaker's 
              apprentice.&quot; We too protest against the irreverent familiarity 
              of much popular revivalism. We do not need youth leaders who merely 
              tell our young people to approach God with fearless boldness, lest 
              they fall into the error of irreverent presumption. The youth need 
              the whole truth of God's Word. When they are taught to fear the 
              Majesty of heaven and to tremble at His judgment seat, then may 
              they properly understand what it means to come boldly before Him 
              by faith in the name of Jesus.</font>
            <P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. Rest 
              and Activity</strong></font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gospel is a call 
              to rest. The Lord invites us, &quot;Come unto Me, all ye that labor 
              and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&quot; Matt. 11:28. 
              And the apostle Paul says, &quot;He that is entered into His rest, 
              he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from His.&quot; 
              Heb. 4:10 Yet the believer in Jesus is just as earnestly called 
              to labor. Jesus adds, &quot;Take My yoke [an instrument of toil 
              and service] upon you. . . &quot; Matt. 11:29. The apostle Peter 
              admonished believers, giving all diligence, add to your faith.... 
              give diligence to make your calling and election sure.&quot; 2 Peter 
              1:5, 10. Again he says, &quot;Wherefore gird up the loins of your 
              mind....&quot; 1 Peter 1:13.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus and His apostles 
              repeatedly call us to strive, labor, work, be careful to maintain 
              good works, carry the cross, suffer, endure tribulation, fight the 
              good fight and run the race with patience.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He who rests most fully 
              upon Christ and His free salvation will be the most earnest in active 
              labor for Him. A continual emphasis on resting in Jesus and waiting 
              on the Lord, to the exclusion of an adequate emphasis on the other 
              side of the paradox, leads to mystical quietism. An exaggerated 
              emphasis on the duty of Christian activity leads to pietistic activism. 
              The true message of justification by faith lies in between the two 
              distortions.</font>
            <P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>3. Faith 
              and Works</strong></font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was Melanchthon who 
              said, &quot;We are justified by faith alone; but the faith which 
              justifies us is never alone.&quot; The great apostle Paul is noted 
              for his insistence on faith as the only instrument to receive God's 
              justifying grace. Yet Paul could be just as insistent on the necessity 
              of a labor of love. No one will be saved by his good works; yet 
              it is just as certain that no soul is saved who remains without 
              obedience and good works.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People can become lazy 
              through a one-sided emphasis on faith. Luther was led to complain 
              about this. Of course, he was fully aware of the opposite error. 
              The Reformer likened his efforts with some of his people to getting 
              a drunken German peasant onto a horse&nbsp;&#8212; put him up on one side and 
              he falls off the other. Some teachers will keep harping, &quot;There 
              is nothing for you to do. All you have to do is believe.&quot; We 
              cannot deny that there is some truth in the statement if faith is 
              taken in the full, broad, Biblical sense, it is all that is necessary. 
              But many people do not understand faith in the fullest sense. The 
              preaching of the cross of Christ will create faith&mdash;a faith that 
              will be busy and active in the service of God and man. Faith is 
              not an opiate that lulls people to sleep. Faith is a stimulant that 
              will stir all the energies of the soul. Never should the impression 
              be given that good works are unnecessary or unimportant. No one 
              can really read the practical teachings of Jesus and obtain this 
              distorted impression.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two things are clearly 
              taught in Paul &mdash; justification by faith and a final judgment according 
              to works. These two great truths may appear to be paradoxical, but 
              both need to be taught. In his great classic on <em>The Doctrine 
              of Justification</em> (reprinted by The Banner of Truth Trust, 1961). 
              James Buchanan reports how his teacher, Dr. Chalmers, used to say, 
              &quot;I would have every preacher insist strenuously on these two 
              doctrines&mdash;a present Justification by grace, through faith alone&mdash;and 
              a future Judgment according to works.&quot; Buchanan adds, &quot;And 
              all faithful ministers have made use of both, that they might guard 
              equally against the peril of self-righteous legalism, on the one 
              hand, and of practical antinomianism on the other.&quot;&mdash;Pages 252, 
              253.</font>
            <P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>4. Law 
              and Gospel</strong></font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The whole Bible may be 
              divided into these two&mdash;law and gospel. Law requires us to do, work 
              and run the way of God's commandments. Anything that commands us 
              what we should do, how we should live and what we must be, is law, 
              e.g., &quot;Love thy neighbor,&quot; &quot;Be kindly affectioned 
              one to another,&quot; &quot;Love not the world,&quot;&quot; Live 
              peaceably with all men.&quot; Law is not only taught in the Old 
              Testament but all through the teachings of Jesus and His apostles. 
              On the other hand, the gospel says. &quot;Stand still, and see the 
              salvation of the Lord,&quot; &quot;Be still, and know that I am 
              God.&quot; It does not tell us what our hand owes to God but proclaims 
              what God's hand freely gives to us. In Jesus Christ, God gives us 
              all that the law requires (Rom.10:4) &mdash; perfect righteousness for 
            its fulfillment and perfect atonement for its satisfaction.</font>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Romans 10:4  For Christ is the end of the law, that every one who has faith may be justified. </font>                        </p>
            </blockquote>            
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Edmund Schlink points 
              out in his <em>Theology of our Lutheran Confessions</em>, &quot;As 
              the law cannot be preached without Christ, so Christ's work cannot 
              be preached without the law.&quot;&mdash;p. 86. How could we know our 
              sin and the greatness of our debt without the law? (Rom. 3:20; 7:7-12). </font>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Romans 3:20   For no human being will be justified in his sight by works of the law, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Romans 7:7-12 NJB What should we say, then? That the Law itself is sin? Out of the question! All the same, if it had not been for the Law, I should not have known what sin was; for instance, I should not have known what it meant to covet if the Law had not said: You are not to covet. 8 But, once it found the opportunity through that commandment, sin produced in me all kinds of covetousness; as long as there is no Law, sin is dead. 9 Once, when there was no Law, I used to be alive; but when the commandment came, sin came to life 10 and I died. The commandment was meant to bring life but I found it brought death, 11 because sin, finding its opportunity by means of the commandment, beguiled me and, by means of it, killed me. 12 So then, the Law is holy, and what it commands is holy and upright and good. </font> </p>
            </blockquote>            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He who has never had the law instruct him about the bitterness of 
                  his sin, could never appreciate the sweetness of the gospel of saving 
                  grace. Further, since the gospel gives us all that the law demands 
                  of us (Rom. 10:4), how can we appreciate what God gives unless we 
                  have first heard the law?</font>
                        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Law and gospel must be 
              carefully distinguished. This is the cornerstone of the Reformation. 
              Yet both must be preserved in proper tension, and, as the Formula 
            of Concord says, </font>                        
                        <blockquote>
                          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;These two doctrines [law and gospel], we 
                    believe and confess, should ever and ever be diligently inculcated 
                    in the Church of God even to the end of the world.&quot;&mdash;<em>Book 
                    of Concord</em> (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1957),p. 
                    261.</font>
                          </p>
                        </blockquote>            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The power of gospel preaching 
              will be in proportion to the power of preaching the law. Let the 
              law fall into disuse, and the gospel becomes a tame old tale, a 
              mere sentiment, &quot;cheap grace,&quot; a message that bores the 
              world. Let the law be exalted and proclaimed as the expression of 
              God's holy will, and sinners will cry out, &quot;What must I do 
              to be saved?&quot; On the other hand, when the gospel is pushed 
              aside, moralism, pharisaism and self-righteousness triumph, and 
              the social-gospel advocates try to establish the kingdom of God 
              by human activity.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we stand by the faith 
              of the Reformation doctrine of justification by faith, we shall 
              see that the gospel does not cancel out the law nor does the law 
              weaken the free gift of the gospel. Neither can be neglected without 
              neglecting the other.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We live in an age when 
              authority is under fire, and back of all this is the human hostility 
              against the authority of God, His government and His law. Much of 
              today's so-called preaching of justification by faith by so-called 
              Protestants, is wishy-washy sentimentalism that does not lead the 
              hearers to repent of their transgression of God's holy law nor does 
              it produce lives that show any great respect for that law. Such 
              preaching bears no resemblance to the message of the Puritans, the 
              Reformers and, least of all, the apostles.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Law and gospel are a 
              paradox. They must be preserved in proper tension. Unless we do 
              this, we shall distort the gospel of Christ.</font>
            <P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>5. The 
              Nature of a Christian Man</strong></font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is a Christian a sinner 
              or a saint? Luther struggled with this problem until he produced 
              the famous formula that became a firm plank in all Reformation theology &#8212; <em>simul 
              justus et peccator</em>, which means, <em>at the same time righteous and 
              a sinner.</em> This is a tremendous paradox. The Roman Catholic party 
              could not grasp it. But the more this paradox is examined, the more 
              it shines with light, throwing clarity on many otherwise unsolvable 
              riddles.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The believer in Jesus 
              is righteous before God because God pronounces him righteous for 
              the sake of Christ. Further, he has by the Spirit become a new creature 
              and has actually begun to be righteous. On the other hand, he must 
            not imagine that he is without sin (1 John 1:8), </font>            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8212;</font>

            </blockquote>                        <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">must confess the

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Romans 7:14-25  NJB We are well aware that the Law is spiritual: but I am a creature of flesh and blood sold as a slave to sin. 15 I do not understand my own behaviour; I do not act as I mean to, but I do things that I hate. 16 While I am acting as I do not want to, I still acknowledge the Law as good, 17 so it is not myself acting, but the sin which lives in me. 18 And really, I know of nothing good living in me -- in my natural self, that is -- for though the will to do what is good is in me, the power to do it is not: 19 the good thing I want to do, I never do; the evil thing which I do not want -- that is what I do. 20 But every time I do what I do not want to, then it is not myself acting, but the sin that lives in me. 21 So I find this rule: that for me, where I want to do nothing but good, evil is close at my side. 22 In my inmost self I dearly love God's law, 23 but I see that acting on my body there is a different law which battles against the law in my mind. So I am brought to be a prisoner of that law of sin which lives inside my body. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body doomed to death? 25 God -- thanks be to him -- through Jesus Christ our Lord.

 —  the inevitable sinfulness of all

              are thus tempted to look for some exciting experience in the Spirit 
              to lift them out of the daily tension of being <em>simul justus et peccator</em>. 
              Much of the holiness-Pentecostal emphasis is a premature seizure

              easily excuse sin, carouse on God's mercy and expect the hereafter

              why Luther had the correct position on this question. He fully realized 
              that the truth of the matter could only be expressed by two groups 
              of statements which seem to be antithetical. His emphasis was neither 
              Calvinistic nor Arminian. He took each side of the paradox with 
              equal seriousness and preserved the tension between confidence in 
              his security in Christ and fear of the possibility of his falling 
              from grace. I will not ask you to take the texts you quoted to me 
              less seriously. I simply appeal to you to take the other side of 
              the paradox just as seriously. Unless you do this, your view of 
              truth will be distorted.&quot;</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr. X: </strong>&quot;Thank you.

            <P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>7. Predestination 
              and Atonement for All</strong></font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of my friends feel 
              that they must believe in a &quot;limited atonement&quot; in order 
              to be consistent with the Bible doctrine of predestination. Some 
              of the letters to the editor even claim that the entire Reformation 
              stood on the concept of predestination and limited atonement. We 
              readily admit that, humanly speaking, predestination and limited 
              atonement are consistent. But we also hasten to add, &quot;Extreme 
              views have the advantage of remarkable consistency.&quot;&mdash; H. Bezzel, 
              <em>Berufung and Beruf</em> (Neuendettelsau, 1926), p.64. Such consistency 
              is achieved by either ignoring or destroying the paradoxical nature 
              of divine truth.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We would also point out 
              that the greatest Reformer believed in predestination <em>and</em> an unlimited 
              atonement. Some will reply, &quot;Unfortunately, Luther wasn't consistent.&quot; 
              If consistency means destroying the Biblical paradox, Luther would 
              be first to admit his teaching was not consistent. But he was too 
              well aware that the truths of divine revelation often appear antithetical 
              and illogical to human reasoning.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the book of Romans, 
              Paul does not start with predestination as his theme. He moves from 
              justification by faith to predestination. He does this to show that 
              God is wholly the author of our faith and that every notion of human 
              merit must be rejected.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even those Reformers 
              who adopted the view of a more rigid determinism did not defend 
              their view of predestination for its own sake. Their central concern 
              was the exclusion of human merit. Luther found the doctrine of predestination 
              useful when disputing with men like Erasmus, because it took the 
              entire initiative of our salvation out of our fallen wills and placed 
              it in the divine will.</font>

              other side of the paradox &mdash;the doing and dying of Jesus Christ for

            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Luther once received 
              a letter from a man who was deeply troubled about whether he was 
              one of those predestined to salvation. The Reformer replied:</font>
            <ul>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Look 
                at the words [of John 3:16] I beseech you, to determine how and

                was given for all. All should believe, and all who believe should 
                not perish, etc. Take hold of your own nose, I beseech you, to 
                determine whether you are not a human being (that is, part of the

            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the reasons for 
              the remarkable success of the Wesleyan revival was its universal 
              appeal that Christ died for all. The sheer good news of God's unlimited 
              grace set hearts singing, voices ringing and feet running. Wesley 
              abhorred the thought of any cold determinism. His critics were able 
              to point to some weaknesses in his theology, but Wesley had a better 
              over-all concept of the character of God than did some of his more 
              orthodox critics.<sup>2</sup> And few would deny that he accomplished more 
              good.</font>

            <P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>8. Justification 
              and Sanctification</strong></font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We cannot speak without 
              paradoxes when we deal with the relation between justification and 
              sanctification. The whole of church history has been a struggle 
              to hold them in proper tension.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are justified solely 
              by a work <em>outside</em> of ourselves, but we are sanctified by God's Spirit 
              <em>within</em> us. The essence of Roman Catholic legalism is to depend on 
              the work of inward renewal for acceptance with God. But the essence 
              of Protestant antinomianism is to suppose that we can be sanctified 
              and fitted for heaven by Christ's work outside of us.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No amount of sanctification 
              can secure one's admittance to the kingdom of grace; but justification 
              is always endangered if sanctification is not exercised. Obedience 
              cannot secure the blessing of forgiveness; but by willful and persistent 
              disobedience, the birthright may be sold.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But now we must look 
              at the other side of the picture. Sanctification is endangered if 
              it is not based on justification. There must be a constant return 
              to justification, to the word of forgiveness, if sanctification 
              is to be preserved from Pharisaism and self-righteousness. Prayer 
              and service are only good by gracious acceptance. The truth of justification 
              calls all that we do into question. True Christian growth can only 
              exist where there is a growing appreciation of justification. We 
              can never reach a point in our progress in sanctification where 
              our acceptance with God does not rest entirely on the forgiveness of 
              sins.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The constant need of 
              justification by faith means that human sinfulness is inescapable 
              for there is no man on earth that does not sin (Eccl. 1:20), and 
              all continue to fall short of God's glory (Rom. 3:23). But sanctification 
              teaches us of our positive duty to avoid sin. On one hand we are 
              called to repose; on the other hand, to a life of fervent activity.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justification gives us 
              perfection, and sanctification urges us to press on toward it. Through 
              justifying faith the heart is cleansed of all sin; yet are we called 
              to go on purifying our souls by obeying the truth. And so we could 
              go on to enumerate many aspects of the paradoxical relation between 
              justification and sanctification. It is the paradox of present possession 
              and future hope; to be pure and yet impure; to possess all things, 
              yet have nothing (2 Cor. 6:10); to rest in faith, yet labor in love; 
              to be made free by faith, yet to be made a servant of all by love; 
              to be consoled, yet to be admonished. And we think of the paradoxical 
              experience of the great apostle:</font>
            <ul>
              <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;we are troubled 
              on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in 
              despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; 
              always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that 
              the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. For we 
              which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that 
              the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.&quot; 
              2 Cor. 4:8-11.</font>
            </ul>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">How 
              to Relate to the Paradox</font></B></font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this life we must 
              live by accepting and living with the paradox of having and not 
              having, of being righteous and unrighteous, of being complete and 
              incomplete, of rest and activity, of believing and working, of confidence 
              and fear, of being able to do all things through Christ and not 
              being able to do the things that we would, of avoiding sin and confessing 
              its inevitability, of victory over sin and mourning that when we 
              would do good evil is present with us, of advancement and repentance, 
              of freedom and subjection, and so on. It is the mark of immaturity, 
              we repeat, to emphasize only one side of the paradox, especially 
              so as to cancel out the truth of the other side.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Law and gospel, faith 
              and works, justification and sanctification, and all the great paradoxes, 
              need to be kept in proper tension. If we proclaim the glory of God's 
              justifying grace and imagine that this alone will motivate people 
              to earnestly pursue sanctification, it will not be long before we 
              shall realize that the sinful nature needs to be warned and sharply 
              admonished in the pathway of obedience. But lest the language of 
              Christian experience should become all too loud and confident, there 
              must be a return to the critical sternness of justification; otherwise, 
              sanctification will turn into romanticism or dangerous &quot;holiness&quot; 
              pretensions.</font>
            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Think of flying a plane. 
              There are two antithetical forces &#8212; gravity and speed. One must 
              not cancel out the other, but the secret of flying is to keep both 
              in proper tension. If the tension of speed against gravity is not 
              maintained, a person comes crashing down. If gravity ceases, he 
              goes off into orbit somewhere.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
