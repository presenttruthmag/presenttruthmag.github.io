  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="30pg06-2.gif" alt="" width=172 height=398 border="0" align="right">We make no apologies for returning directly to the theme of justification by faith, which is the only real reason for the existence of this magazine. Here, as Luther often said, is the central Christian article, which builds, defends and preserves the Christian church. If it is lost, all is lost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On every hand old and new (but mostly old) errors lift their head and threaten to rob us of the truth which the Reformers called the chief jewel of Christianity. We cannot learn this article too well, and unless we constantly sharpen the sword of truth, there is good reason to believe that its edge will become dulled.<br>
<br>
It is often implied that a strong affirmation of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ will take the teeth out of the moral imperatives. Nothing is further from the truth. It was Rome's claim that the Reformers' doctrine was subversive to sanctification, but this was Rome's most fundamental error.<br>
<br>
In the light of the foregoing we reprint an essay by Dr. Immanuel Stockmeyer which was presented in 1863 and published in The Foundations of Our Faith (London: Strahan and Co., 1863).<br>
<br>
Also, we include a short article by Thomas Chalmers on &quot;Justification and Holiness.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. William C. Robinson has written an excellent summary of Dr. Witherspoon's pamphlet on the connection between the doctrine of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ and holiness of life. We consider that in this summary Dr. Robinson gives us the essence of Christian life and experience.<br>
  
<br>
  Someone sent us an article called &quot;The True Ground of Peace.&quot; Some of our readers may be able to identify the author for us. Spurgeon preached in a similar vein on occasion. For the present we will publish it anonymously. It is a refreshing change from a lot of harping on man's acts of faith and surrender in such a way that these proper human acts run competition with Jesus.<br>
  
<br>
  
Altogether, we think that there needs to be more talking, singing, praying, witnessing and celebrating about the righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ. If we did this, we would see more faith, surrender, repentance and holiness.<br>
  
<br>
  
Come, let us reason together.<br>
