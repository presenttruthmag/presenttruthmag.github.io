Personally, I have to bless God for many good books; I thank Him for Dr. Doddridge's<em> Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul</em>; for Baxter's <em>Call to the Unconverted</em>; for Alleine's <em>Alarm to Unconverted Sinners</em>; and for James' <em>Anxious Enquirer</em>, but my gratitude most of all is due to God, not for books, but for the preached Word&mdash;and that too addressed to me by a poor, uneducated man, a man who had never received any training for the ministry, and probably will never be heard of in this life, a man engaged in business, no doubt of a humble kind, during the week, but who had just enough of grace to say on the Sabbath, &quot;Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.&quot; The books were good, but the man was better. The revealed Word awakened me, but it was the preached Word that saved me; and I must ever attach peculiar value to the <em>hearing of the truth</em>, for by it I received the joy and peace in which my soul delights. While under concern of soul, I resolved that I would attend all the places of worship in the town where I lived, in order that I might find out the way of salvation. I was willing to do anything, and be anything, if God would only forgive my sin. I set off, determined to go round to all the chapels, and I did go to every place of worship; but for a long time I went in vain. I do not, however, blame the ministers. One man preached Divine Sovereignty; I could hear him with pleasure, but what was that sublime truth to a poor sinner who wished to know what he must do to be saved? There was another admirable man who always preached about the law, but what was the use of ploughing up ground that needed to be sown? Another was a practical preacher. I heard him, but it was very much like a commanding officer teaching the manoeuvres of war to a set of men without feet. What could I do? All his exhortations were lost on me. I knew it was said, &quot;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,&quot; but I did not know what it was to believe on Christ. These good men all preached truths suited to many in their congregations who were spiritually&mdash;minded people, but what I wanted to know was, &quot;How can I get my sins forgiven?&quot;&mdash;and they never told me that. I desired to hear how a poor sinner, under a sense of sin, might find peace with God, and when I went, I heard a sermon on, &quot;Be not deceived, God is not mocked,&quot; which cut me up still worse, but did not bring me into rest. I went again, another day, and the text was something about the glories of the righteous; nothing for poor me! I was like a dog under the table, not allowed to eat of the children's food. I went time after time, and I can honestly say that I do not know that I ever went without prayer to God, and I am sure there was not a more attentive hearer than myself in all the place, for I panted and longed to understand how I might be saved.<br>

<br>

I sometimes think I might have been in darkness and despair until now had it not been for the goodness of God in sending a snowstorm, one Sunday morning, while I was going to a certain place of worship. When I could go no further, I turned down a side street, and came to a little Primitive Methodist Chapel. In that chapel there may have been a dozen or fifteen people. I had heard of the Primitive Methodists, how they sang so loudly that they made people's heads ache; but that did not matter to me. I wanted to know how I might be saved, and if they could tell me that, I did not care how much they made my head ache. The minister did not come that morning; he was snowed up, I suppose. At last, a very thin-looking man, a shoemaker, or tailor, or something of that sort, went up into the pulpit to preach. Now, it is well that preachers should be instructed, but this man was really stupid. He was obliged to stick to his text, for the simple reason that he had little else to say. The text was&mdash;<br>



</font>
<ul>
  <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.&quot;</font>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="31pg24d.gif" alt="" width=238 height=374 border="0" align="left">He did not even pronounce the words rightly, but that did not matter. There was, I thought, a glimpse of hope for me in that text. The preacher began thus: &quot;My dear friends, this is a very simple text indeed. It says, 'Look.' Now lookin' don't take a deal of pain. It ain't liftin' your foot or your finger; it is just, 'Look.' Well, a man needn't go to College to learn to look. You may be the biggest fool, and yet you can look. A man needn't be worth a thousand a year to be able to look. Anyone can look even a child can look. But then the text says, 'Look unto Me.' Ay!&quot; said he, in broad Essex, &quot;many on ye are lookin' to yourselves, but it's no use lookin' there. You'll never find any comfort in yourselves. Some look to God the Father. No, look to Him by-and-by. Jesus Christ says, 'Look unto Me.' Some on ye say, 'We must wait for the Spirit's workin'.' You have no business with that just now. Look to Christ The text says, 'Look unto Me.'&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then the good man followed up his text in this way: &quot;Look unto Me; I am sweatin' great drops of blood. Look unto Me; I am hangin' on the cross. Look unto Me; I am dead and buried. Look unto Me; I rise again. Look unto Me; I ascend to Heaven. Look unto Me; I am sittin' at the Father's right hand. 0 poor sinner, look unto Me! look unto Me!&quot;<br>

    When he had gone to about that length, and managed to spin out ten minutes or so, he was at the end of his tether. Then he looked at me under the gallery, and I dare say, with so few present, he knew me to be a stranger. Just fixing his eyes on me, as if he knew all my heart, he said, &quot;Young man, you look very miserable.&quot; Well, I did, but I had not been accustomed to have remarks made from the pulpit on my personal appearance before. However, it was a good blow, struck right home. He continued, &quot;and you always will be miserable&mdash;miserable in life, and miserable in death&mdash;if you don't obey my text; but if you obey now, this moment, you will be saved.&quot; Then, lifting up his hands, he shouted, as only a Primitive Methodist could do, &quot;Young man, look to Jesus Christ. Look! Look! Look! You have nothin' to do but to look and live.&quot; I saw at once the way of salvation. I know not what else he said&mdash;I did not take much notice of it&mdash;I was so possessed with that one thought. Like as when the brazen serpent was lifted up, the people only looked and were healed, so it was with me. I had been waiting to do fifty things, but when I heard that word, &quot;Look!&quot; what a charming word it seemed to me! Oh! I looked until I could almost have looked my eyes away. There and then the cloud was gone, the darkness had rolled away, and that moment I saw the sun; and I could have risen that instant, and sung with the most enthusiastic of them, of the precious blood of Christ, and the simple faith which looks alone to Him. Oh, that somebody had told me this before, &quot;Trust Christ, and you shall be saved.&quot; Yet it was, no doubt, all wisely ordered, and now I can say&mdash;</font>
</p>
<ul>
  <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;E'er since by faith I saw the stream<br>
    
Thy flowing wounds supply,<br>
    
Redeeming love has been my theme,<br>
  And shall be till I die.&quot;</font>
</ul>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think about five days after I first found Christ, when my joy had been such that I could have danced for very mirth at the thought that Christ was mine, on a sudden I fell into a sad fit of despondency. I can tell now why it was so with me. When I first believed in Christ, I am not sure that I thought the devil was dead, but certainly I had a kind of notion that he was so mortally wounded that he could not disturb me. And then I also fancied that the corruption of my nature had received its deathblow. I read what Cowper said&mdash;<br>



</font>
<ul>
  <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Since the dear hour that brought me to Thy foot,<br>
  And cut up all my follies by the root;&quot;</font>
</ul>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and I really thought that the poet knew what he was saying; whereas, never did anyone blunder so terribly as Cowper did when he said that, for no man, I think, has all his follies thus cut up by the roots. However, I fondly dreamed that mine were, I felt persuaded they would never sprout again. I was going to be perfect&mdash;I fully calculated upon it&mdash;and lo, I found an intruder I had not reckoned upon, an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. So I went to that same Primitive Methodist Chapel where I first received peace with God, through the simple preaching of the Word. The text happened to be, &quot;O wretched man that I am: who shall deliver me from the body of this death?&quot; &quot;There,&quot; I thought, &quot;that's the text for me.&quot; I had just got as far as that in the week. I knew that I had put my trust in Christ, and I knew that, when I sat in that house of prayer, my faith was simply and solely fixed on the atonement of the Redeemer. But I had a weight on my mind, because I could not be as holy as I wanted to be. I could not live without sin. When I rose in the morning, I thought I would abstain from every hard word, from every evil thought and look; and I came up to that chapel groaning because, &quot;when I would do good, evil was present with me.&quot; The minister began by saying, &quot;Paul was not a believer when he said this.&quot; Well now, I knew I was a believer, and it seemed to me from the context that Paul must have been a believer, too. (Now, I am sure he was.) The man went on to say that no child of God ever did feel any conflict within. So I took up my hat, and left the chapel, and I have very seldom attended such places since. They are very good for people who are unconverted to go to, but of very little use for children of God. That is my notion of Methodism. It is a noble thing to bring in strangers; but a terrible thing for those that are brought in to sit and feed there. It is like the parish pound, it is a good place to put sheep in when they have strayed, but there is no food inside; they had better be let out as soon as possible to find some grass. I saw that that minister understood nothing of experimental divinity, or of practical heart theology, or else he would not have talked as he did. A good man he was, I do not doubt, but utterly incompetent to the task of dealing with a case like mine.</font><br>
