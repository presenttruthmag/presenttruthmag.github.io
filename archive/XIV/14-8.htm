</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is the New Testament view of the Israel of God? What determines whether a man is a real son of Abraham?<br>
      <br>
      To the Jew it was most important that he could prove he was a son of Abraham, for &quot;to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.&quot; Gal. 3:16. The Pharisees were certain of being part of the Israel of God because they could trace their physical descent back to Abraham. John the Baptist declared that they were resting on a false confidence. &quot;. . . think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father,&quot; he warned them, &quot;for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.&quot; Matt. 3:9. Mere physical descent would give them no claim on God and no right to be included in the Israel of God.<br>
      <br>
      Again, the Pharisees said to Jesus, &quot;Abraham is our father.&quot; John 8:39. But Jesus denied their confident claim, saying, &quot;It ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.&quot; John 8:39. Jesus categorically denied that they were children of Abraham.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Zaccheus showed by his works that he had the faith of Abraham, Jesus declared, &quot;Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.&quot; Luke 19:9, R.S.V. Jesus was not saying that Zaccheus was saved because he was a physical descendant of Abraham&mdash;for there were many Jews in Palestine who were not saved. Jesus was saying that Zaccheus' faith constituted him a real son of Abraham. The Lord could have said to him, as he said to the repentant woman, &quot;Thy faith hath saved thee . . .&quot; Luke
        7:50.<br> 
        
    </font>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          Again, Jesus greeted Nathanael with the salutation, &quot;Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!&quot; John 1:47. The word &quot;indeed&quot; signifies a true, or real, Israelite. Jesus therefore declared that a real Israelite is a man &quot;in whom is no guile.&quot; According to Psalm 32, the guileless man is not a sinless man but the man who honestly continues to confess his sinfulness and who finds forgiveness at the hand of a merciful God. St. Paul cites Psalm 32 and shows that this guileless man (the Israelite &quot;indeed&quot;)
        is the man who is justified by faith (see Rom. 4:1-8).<br>
        
    <br>
        
The clear teaching of Jesus about the real Israel of God is found also in the Epistles of His great apostle. Could words be clearer than the following?</font>
      </p>
<ul>
    <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly: and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. Rom. 2:28, 29.<br>
    
  <br>
    
Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed by called. That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. Rom. 9:7, 8.<br>
    
<br>
    
 . . . even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. Gal. 3:6,7.<br>
    
 <br>
    
And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. Gal. 3:29.</font>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. Gal. 6:15,16.</font>

      <br>
      
God made promises to the seed of Abraham. The Jews are still waiting for God
    to carry out His promises to them, and more amazing, many Christians are now
    waiting for God to carry out His promises to the Jewish nation as the seed of
    Abraham. This is what happens when people read the Old Testament without the
    light and interpretation of the New Testament.<br>
      
<br>
      
Now let us get two simple facts straight once and for all:<br>
      
<br>
      
<strong>1.</strong> God made promises to Abraham's seed (Gal. 3:19).<br>
      
<br>
      <strong>2. </strong>Christ is the Seed of Abraham. (&quot;Now to Abraham and his seed were the
      promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of One, And to
      thy Seed, which is Christ.&quot;)
      This is why Christ is called the Mediator of the covenant. It is only by Him,
      in Him and through Him that God carries out any of His promises to Abraham.<br>
      
  <br>
      The Seed of Abraham is Jesus Christ. It includes all who are in Christ and
      excludes all outside of Christ. So the apostle affirms, &quot;. . . if ye be
      Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.&quot; Gal.
      3:29.<br>
      
  <br>
      When the apostle declares, &quot;And so all Israel shall be saved . . . &quot; (Rom.
      11:26), he is certainly not teaching us that every member of the Jewish race
      will be saved. But the seed of Israel shall be saved &mdash; that is to say, all
      those who are in Jesus Christ &mdash; and not one shall be lost.<br>
      
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <br>
    Neither Jesus nor Paul are speaking in mere allegories when they tell us who
    are the children of Abraham. They are telling us who are real children of Abraham.
    Abraham was justified by faith and therefore became the father of Israel. All
    who are justified by faith are real children of Abraham (Gal. 3:8). The Seed
    of Israel is Jesus Christ. He is also the &quot;King of the Jews.&quot; If a
    man is related to Jesus Christ, who can deny that he is a real Jew according
    to the Scriptures? For those who believe in Jesus Christ are born again (1 John
    5:1), and they actually partake of the nature of Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:4).</font></font></div>
</center><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="14pg42.gif" alt="" width=492 height=479 border="0" align="right"></font><font size="4">The Gentile Church
    Not a Separate Identity</font></B><BR>
  
  <br>
    The Judaizers at Galatia were contending that the Gentiles had to become
    children of Abraham by means of certain changes in their flesh. The apostle
    Paul did not dispute the necessity of Gentiles becoming part of the Israel
    of God. Indeed, &quot;all Israel shall be saved,&quot; and only Israel&nbsp;&#8212; for
    as Jesus said, &quot;salvation is of the Jews.&quot; John 4:22. The
     apostle refuted the wrong method of trying to incorporate the Gentiles into
     the Israel
    of God. His message was clear: Abraham was justified by faith, and every
    Gentile who is justified by faith becomes a son of Abraham (Gal. 3:8). The
    promises were made to the seed of Abraham, and Christ is that Seed. Therefore,
    all who are truly baptized into Christ are in Christ and are part of Abraham's
    seed (Gal. 3:28, 29). Those who have become new creatures by faith in Jesus
    and walk according to the rule of faith are &quot;the Israel of God.&quot; Gal.
    6:15,16.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gentiles who believe the gospel become &quot;fellow heirs&quot; with the faithful Jews. They do not make up a separate body, but they become &quot;fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ by the gospel ...&quot; Eph. 3:6. The Gentiles, &quot;being a wild olive tree, were graffed in among them [the Jews], and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree . . . &quot; Rom. 11:17. Once &quot;aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,&quot; the Gentiles are &quot;made nigh by the blood of Christ.&quot; Eph. 2:12, 13. Being now children of Abraham, part of the commonwealth of Israel and partakers of God's promises to Israel, believing Gentiles make up &quot;the house of Israel&quot; to whom the new covenant promise is given:</font></font>

<ul>
  <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put My laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to Me a people . . . Heb. 8:10.</font>
</ul>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Israel of God are all those who are in Jesus Christ, the Seed of Abraham, the King of the Jews, the One to whom the promises were made. And in Jesus Christ all national distinctions are broken down. &quot;. . . there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek . . .&quot; Rom. 10:12.&quot;... ye are all one in Christ Jesus.&quot; Gal. 3:28. &quot;There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism . . .&quot; Eph 4:4,5. Therefore, in the things of the gospel any national distinctions deny the reality of the atonement of Jesus Christ (Eph. 2:14-17) and are a Judaizing perversion of the New Testament message. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are some who take pride in their literal interpretation of the things of
prophecy, especially Old Testament prophecy. No sound Bible scholar will deny
that the Bible should be read in its historical-grammatical sense or that &quot;literal
wherever possible&quot; is
a good rule. But many prophecies of the Old Testament cannot be taken with strict
literalness. The stone of stumbling to both houses of Israel was not a literal
stone but Jesus Christ. Malachi's Elijah was not literally Elijah but John the
Baptist. Many more examples could be given, but our point is this: How would
we know the true interpretation without the New Testament? Does not the gospel
determine our use of the Old Testament?<br>

<br>
<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="14pg43b.gif" alt="" width=422 height=407 border="0" align="right"></font></b>Besides, a crass literalness is in keeping with the method of interpretation
employed by the Pharisees. When Jesus gave a nonliteral application to the Messianic
prophecy about delivering the captives, they were angry. They refused to have
anything to do with His spiritual kingdom, which could be seen and entered only
by those who were born again. When Jesus spoke of destroying the temple and raising
it up again, they insisted on giving His words a literal meaning. Jesus even
had to rebuke his disciples for taking literally his warning, &quot; . . . beware of the leaven of the Pharisees . . . &quot; Matt. 16:11. Because they thought Jesus spoke about literal bread, He asked, &quot;Do ye not yet understand . . .?&quot; Matt.
16:9.</font>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="4">The New Israel</font></b><br>
    <br>
Just as the Bible presents an old covenant and a new covenant, so it presents an old Israel and a new Israel. The old Israel was constituted under the twelve tribes named after the twelve sons of Jacob. When Jesus chose twelve apostles, He was taking steps to constitute the Christian church. Yet why did he deliberately choose twelve apostles? And why did the apostle James<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> address the church as &quot;the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad&quot;? James 1:1. It was because the New Testament church, comprised of Jews and Gentiles, constituted the new Israel of God.<br>
<br>
When Christ died on the cross, national distinctions were ended. The old national religious economy was as extinct as the old covenant. Henceforth the Christian church, founded on the teachings of the twelve apostles, would be the new Israel, the inheritor of all the promises and responsibilities of Israel of the Old Testament.</font>

              <br>
              Abraham was justified by faith (Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3). Just as Abraham had two
          sons &#8212; Ishmael and Isaac &#8212; so there were always two classes of Jews. Not
                        all were true sons of Abraham. The prophets frequently referred to the faithful
                        remnant,
                        who were the real children of Abraham.<br>
                          
              <br>
              Finally, at the time of the apostles there was a saved &quot;remnant according to the election of grace&quot; (Rom.
                          9:27; 11:5). This remnant were those who welcomed their Messiah and were justified
                          by faith in Jesus. God's word had not failed (Rom. 9:6). These alone were the
                          lineage of Isaac, and the rest were counted as Ishmaelites &mdash; illegitimate children.
                          All Israel &mdash; that is, all who were justified by faith &mdash; would be saved according
                          to God's promise, which could never fail (Rom. 11:26). And all from among the
                          Gentiles who would believe on Christ and be justified by faith would become
                          children of Abraham. There is one way of salvation, one body, one faith, one
                          baptism. Christ is the Seed of Abraham. The promises of God are by Him, to
                          Him, through Him and in Him. He is the Elect One (Isa. 42:1), and the chosen
                          people are those who are chosen in Him (Eph. 1:4).<br>
