    The principal means of conviction is the law, the law of God in its purity,
    spirituality, and power; for 'by the law is the knowledge of sin,' and 'the
    law is our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.' The law in its holy commandment,
    the law in its awful curse, the law in its spiritual nature, as reaching
    to the heart, and in all its length and breadth as extending over every department
    of human life, the law in its condemning power, whereby 'every mouth must
    be stopped, and all the world must become guilty before God'&mdash;this law is
    unfolded to the understanding and applied to the conscience by the Holy Spirit,
    and immediately, by its own self-evidencing light, it convinces; the conscience
    is constrained to do homage to the law, and to acknowledge that 'the law
    is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good;' while, self-convicted
    and self-condemned, the sinner exclaims, 'But I am carnal, sold under sin.'
    </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And yet it is not a new law, nor one of which the sinner had heretofore been
      entirely ignorant, that becomes the means of his conviction; he may have
      read and repeated the ten commandments a hundred times, and may be familiar
      with the letter of God's requirements, and yet some one of these very commandments
      may now become as an arrow in his conscience, the very sword of the Spirit.
      A notional acquaintance with the law is one thing, a spiritual experience
      of its power is another. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Witness the case of the apostle Paul, an educated
        man, brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, walking from his youth upwards according
        to the straitest sect of the law, a Pharisee; who can doubt that he was familiar
        with the letter of God's law? yet, being destitute of any spiritual experience
        of its power, he regarded himself as having been without any due knowledge
        of the law till he was taught by the Spirit of God; for, says he, 'I was
        alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and
        I died.' Previously he had only that notional and common knowledge which
        he elsewhere describes as 'the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the
        law.' And what was it that converted the form into substance? It was one
        of those very commandments which he had often read and repeated without perceiving
        its spiritual import or feeling its convicting power: 'I had not know sin
        but by the law, for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt
        not covet.' He seizes the tenth commandment, a commandment which directly
        refers to the state of a man's heart, and finding that his heart cannot stand
        the test of a law so pure and spiritual, he is inwardly convinced of sin,
        as well as made conscious of its power; and so every sinner who obtains a
        glimpse of the real nature of the divine law, which, like its heartsearching
        Author, is heart-searching too, must on the instant feel, that if this law
        be the rule of judgment, then, by the deeds of the law shall no flesh living
        be justified; for 'all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.'<br>
    
      <br>
        But when it is said that the law is the principal means by which the Spirit
        of God convinces the conscience of a sinner, that term must be understood
        in an enlarged sense, as including under it every principle which has any
        relation or affinity to the conscience, and every fact in which any such
        principle is involved. It is not the bare law, as it stands declared in the
        Ten Commandments, that is the sole instrument of conviction, but the moral
        principle of that law, whether as it is displayed in the retributions of
        a righteous Providence, or illustrated by the afflictions of human life,
        or exemplified in the conduct of believers and the perfect pattern of Christ,
        or as unfolded in the parables, or as embodied in the Gospel and shining
        forth in the cross. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The law is a schoolmaster that brings the sinner to Christ;
          but Christ is a teacher that brings the sinner to know the law as he never
          knew it before. The law points the eye of a convinced sinner to the cross;
          but the cross throws in upon his conscience a flood of light which sheds
          a reflex lustre on the law. Hence we believe that the Gospel of Christ, and
          especially the doctrine of the cross of Christ, is the most powerful instrument
          for impressing the conscience of a sinner, and for turning his convictions
          into genuine contrition of heart. And this because the Gospel, and especially
          the doctrine of the cross, contains in it the spirit and essence of the law;
          it recognizes and proceeds upon the moral principles of God's government,
          and affords a new and most impressive manifestation of the holiness of the
          Lawgiver, and the turpitude of sin; while, at the same time, it unfolds such
          a proof of the compassion and love of God as is peculiarly fitted to melt
          and subdue the heart, which the mere terrors of the law might only turn into
          a more hardened and unrelenting obduracy. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let the sinner who makes light
            of sin turn his eye to the cross of Christ, and he will see there, as well
            as amidst the thunderings and the lightnings of Sinai, that the Lord is a
            jealous God, that sin is the abominable thing which he hates, and that he
            is resolved, at all hazards, and notwithstanding whatever suffering it may
            occasion, to visit it with condign punishment; let him look to the cross,
            and behold there, suspended on that accursed tree, the Son of God himself;
            let him listen to the words which fell from that illustrious sufferer in
            the midst of his agony and passion, 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
            me?' and let him then inquire, why was it that he, of whom it had been once
            and again proclaimed from the highest heavens, 'This is my beloved Son, in
            whom I am well pleased,' and of whom it is recorded, that once and again,
            on his bended knees, and with all the earnestness of importunate supplication,
            he had prayed in the garden, '0 my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
            pass from me'&mdash;why was it that he, who was thus affectionately spoken of as
            God's beloved Son, and who, as a Son, so submissively poured out his heart
            into a Father's ear, was nevertheless subjected to the agony and death of
            the cross? </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And when, in reply to all his inquiries, the Bible declares, that
              the Son of God suffered because he had consented to become chargeable with
              sin, that he 'who knew no sin was made sin for us,' and that, therefore,
              'it pleased the Lord to bruise him, and to put him to grief;' that 'he was
              wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities;' and that
              he died, because the wages of sin is death: oh! does not the sinner now feel
              in his inmost soul, that if Sinai be dreadful, Calvary has its terrors too;
              that if 'by the law is the knowledge of sin,' the Gospel adds its sublime
              and harmonious commentary; that the cross of Christ is the most awful monument
              of Heaven's justice, the most solemn memorial of the sinner's danger; and
              does he not infer, with all the quickness of intuition, that if sin was not
              spared, nor left unpunished, but visited with condemnation and death, when
              it was imputed to his own, his only, his well-beloved Son, much less will
              sin, unexpiated and unforgiven, be spared, or left unpunished, when, after
              this solemn work of atonement, God will arise to plead with those who cleave
            to that accursed thing which nailed the Saviour to the tree? </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The cross,&mdash;the
                cross of a crucified Saviour&mdash;is the most powerful, the most impressive demonstration
                of sin, and righteousness, and judgment. The cross may well alarm every sleeping
                sinner, and awaken every slumbering conscience, and stir into agitation and
                tumult every listless and impenitent heart. It is the law by which we obtain
                the knowledge of sin; but the law is magnified in the cross; and it is the
                law in the cross that carries home to every awakened conscience the most
                alarming convictions of guilt. Can I hope to be spared, may one say, when
                'God spared not his own Son?' Are my sins venial, or light? These sins of
                mine were enough, when transferred to the Son of God, to nail him to the
            tree! </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">May I venture into eternity in the hope that my sins may be forgotten
                  there? And why were they remembered here, when God's Son ascended the hill
                  of Calvary? May not the strictness of God's law be relaxed in my favour?
                  But why, oh! why was it not relaxed in favour of Christ? No; that one fact,
                  that awful cross which was erected on the hill beside Jerusalem, annihilates
                  every ground of careless security, tears from me every rag by which I would
                  seek to cover my shame, drives me from every refuge to which I would repair;&mdash;that
                  one fact, that Christ died for sin, shuts me up to the conviction, that as
                  a sinner I stand exposed to the wrath and curse of an offended God, and that
            the outraged law must receive a full and final vindication. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But must it be
                    by my personal and everlasting punishment? Yes, assuredly, if I stand on
                    the footing of law; for 'the soul that sinneth, it shall die.' But look again
                    to that mysterious cross: amidst the darkness which surrounds it, and the
                    awful manifestations of God's wrath which the sufferer felt, there breaks
                    forth a light, glorious as the sun shining in its strength, unlike the lightnings
                    which flashed around Sinai; this is the Sun of Righteousness rising with
                    healing in its beams, the effulgent light of God's love, the glorious manifestation
                    of God's grace and mercy; for 'God so loved the world as to give his Son.'
            </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Look once more; for the same cross which wounds will also heal; the same
                      conscience which is pierced by the arrows of conviction may be pacified by
                      the Gospel of peace; and thus all that is terrible in the cross, when combined
                      with the tenderness of God's mercy, and the amazing, the self-denying, the
                      self-sacrificing love of the Saviour, will then only awaken convictions in
                      the conscience, to melt and change them into sweet contrition of heart.<br>
                  
              <br>
              It is thus that, under the Gospel dispensation, the Spirit of God convinces the conscience by pressing home the eternal and unchangeable principles of the law, as these are embodied, illustrated, and displayed in a new and better dispensation. It is not the naked law, but the law in all its forms and manifestations, and especially the law in the facts and truths of the Gospel, which is thus used. For the Spirit reproves the world of sin&mdash;why? because they believe not on me; of righteousness, because I go to my Father; of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged&mdash;all having reference to Christ and his cross.</font><font size="-1"><br>
