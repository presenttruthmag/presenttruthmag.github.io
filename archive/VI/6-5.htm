      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Editorial Note:</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> "Holiness" theology fails to appreciate the primacy, supremacy and all-sufficiency of imputed righteousness. Instead of allowing this passive righteousness to be the glory of the Christian faith, "holiness" teaching subordinates it to what is supposed to be the higher virtue of the infused righteousness of Christ, or the active Christian righteousness of the believer. The following brief article by a Christian layman, especially the tabulated summary, gives a very clear focus to the true foundation of the believer's hope.</font>
      <p>
      <hr size=1>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">Q. </font></strong>Is it necessary to have imparted (infused) righteousness in order to insure our acceptance with God?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">A. </font></strong>No, it is not necessary, for our acceptance is not grounded on any quality in us but on the worthiness and glory of the Son of God. The gospel of God is "concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord" and His divine virtues, not us or our virtues. Forgiveness and acceptance are not offered us because we deserve them but because we need them. In other words, like any orphan, we are taken in because of our need, not our worth. The blood of Christ is the seal of the new covenant promise, which promise, together with the oath, contains the immutable word of God, providing strong consolation and an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, to the believer (Heb. 6:17-19). To doubt our acceptance is simply to disbelieve the oath and promise, and make God doubly a liar (see I John 5:10-12). "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. . . let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith . . . " Heb. 10:19, 22. Here is the certainty of our acceptance&mdash;the blood of Christ.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">Q. </font></strong>Do you mean our acceptance is sure with God without any sanctification in us?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">A.</font></strong> Our acceptance is based on the sanctification accomplished by the will of God. "By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." "For by one offering He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified." Heb. 10:10, 14. Everything which attached to us as children of Adam has been abolished. Our sins have been purged and put away (Heb. 1:3; 9:26). Eternal redemption has been obtained for us (Heb. 9:12). And all this is according to the good pleasure of the will of God, to the praise of the glory of His grace (Eph. 1:5-8). It is God's pleasure to have a people cleansed of all sin, able to approach Him without the slightest hesitation or doubt. He desires to have a people whom He can regard according to His own estimate of the value of the one perfect offering of Christ &mdash; that is, a people upon whom He can look with the greatest of pleasure. And He has achieved such a people by the efficacy of the blood of Christ.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">Q.</font></strong> Does this mean that, in 
            the full knowledge of our own utter sinfulness, we can come to God with 
            a clear conscience, trusting only in the blood of Christ for our complete 
            acceptance?</font>
      </p>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">A. </font></strong>Yes, absolutely. The blood 
        of Christ is the only ground of our hope. "For the law made nothing perfect, 
        but the bringing in of a better hope did . . .Heb. 7:19. What is this 
        which is made perfect by the better hope, by the one perfect offering?" 
        . . . which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered 
        both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service 
        perfect, as pertaining to the conscience. . . Heb. 9:9. "For the law. 
        . . can never with those sacrifices . . . make the comers thereunto perfect. 
        For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers 
        once purged should have had no more conscience of sins." Heb. 10:1, 2.</font>
      <P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Let us note these two vital 
      points:</strong></font>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">(1)</font></strong> The offerings and sacrifices under the law could not bring 
              the worshipers perfection. But the offering of the body of Christ did 
          perfect the believers. </font>      </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">(2)</font></strong> The perfection which they have through the 
              one offering of Christ is perfection of the <em>conscience</em>; that is, they 
              have "no more conscience of sins." This does not mean no more <em>consciousness</em>          of their sins. It means that worshipers have such assurance of being separated 
          from their sins and set apart for God by the blood of Christ, that they 
          can approach Him with all the liberty of the angel Gabriel, who dwells 
          in the presence of God. How can this be? Because, by the death of Christ, 
          sins have been purged so completely that in the sight of God not a taint 
    of defilement, not a stain, of guilt, rests upon His people.</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Viewed from God's side, they 
        are "holy and without blame before Him in love." As seen by God through 
        the sacrifice of His Son, they are completely divested of everything which 
        naturally attached to them as Adam's fallen children. So great is the 
        efficacy of the blood of Christ! Not a thing remains to separate His sanctified 
        people from Himself.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When this glorious truth is 
        brought home to the consciences of believers, it gives them such liberty 
        that they can approach God just as if they had never sinned. Believers 
        identify themselves with the offering of Christ and not with their sins, 
        their shortcomings, their failures. They do not regard their sins lightly, 
        but they appreciate the great sacrifice made for them. They see in that 
        sacrifice the complete end of all their estrangement from God and the 
        bringing in of complete reconciliation with Him. Every question of sin 
        is settled. They are not by any means perfect as pertaining to their own 
        state. But they are perfected in their conscience. There is no doubt as 
        to their full and absolute acceptance with God, no matter how they appear 
        in their own eyes.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">Q.</font></strong> If the question of sin is 
        settled so simply on the basis of the sacrifice of Christ, what need is 
        there for inward sanctification?</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">A.</font></strong> A great need, but not to 
        make us acceptable or pleasing to God. Rather, inward sanctification is 
        to cleanse and purify our hearts and enlarge our spiritual vision so that 
        God will become more acceptable and more pleasing to us. Then we will 
        enjoy fellowship with Him more and do better service for Him. But this 
        experience is only for those who are free in conscience and spirit because 
        of the certainty of their acceptance. It is not for those who are seeking 
        to better themselves in order to become more pleasing to God. Those who 
        do this simply demonstrate that they are not pleased with God and His 
        ways.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">Q. </font></strong>Does not this teaching produce 
        careless believers, ungodly professors?</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">A.</font></strong> No. There is no such thing 
        as a careless or ungodly believer. All the ungodly are unbelievers. The 
        effect of the grace of God brought home to the conscience of the believer, 
        is to humble him in repentance for the sins which have crucified the Saviour. 
        The knowledge of forgiveness of sin always leads to godly living (see 
        Titus 2:11, 12; Ps. 32:1,6; 130:4).</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">Q.</font></strong> How would you define "grace"?</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">A.</font></strong> Grace is that peculiar disposition 
        in the heart of God to favor those who deserve only condemnation. Adam's 
        fall gave God the opportunity to demonstrate just how abounding in grace 
        He is. Angels do not receive such favor. Sinners deserve nothing; yet 
        there is nothing God will not do for them. Calvary proves that. God will 
        go to any length to heap favors on sinners; and the worse they are, the 
        more He favors them. He offers them the highest place in heaven, the nearest 
        position to the throne. The parable of the prodigal son reveals the grace 
        of the Father. He looks for us while we are in our filthy rags. He puts 
        the robe of righteousness on us after embracing us. He does not clean 
        us up first so that He can embrace us with more relish. He wants us to 
        know that our rightful place is in His presence&mdash;in His bosom. If we can 
        accept this place by faith, we will experience it in fact.</font>
