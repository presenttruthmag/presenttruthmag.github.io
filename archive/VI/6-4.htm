        <font size="2">Menno Simons was a contemporary of the Reformers, although 
        he was not a part of the Reformation mainstream. The best Protestant historians, 
        however, concede that he stood close to Luther on his concept of justification 
        by faith. </font></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We here reproduce 
        Menno's touching and inspiring "Letter of Consolation to a Sick Saint."<sup>1</sup>        It rings absolutely true to the gospel in that it places the believer's 
        hope and security outside of his own experience.</font><BR>
        <br>
        <B><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Letter of Consolation<sup>2</sup></font></B>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"My elect and beloved sister 
        in Christ Jesus; much mercy, grace, and peace be to you, most beloved 
        sister whom I have ever sincerely loved in Christ,</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"From your dear husband's letter 
        I understand that during all the winter you have been a sick and afflicted 
        child, which I very much regret to hear. But we pray daily: Holy Father, 
        Thy will be done. By this we transfer our will into that of the Father 
        to deal with us as is pleasing in His blessed sight. Therefore bear your 
        assigned affliction with a resigned heart. For all this is His fatherly 
        will for your own good, and that you may turn with your inmost being from 
        all transitory things and direct yourself to the eternal and living God. 
        Be comforted in Christ Jesus, for after the winter comes the summer, and 
        after death comes life. O sister, rejoice that you are a true daughter 
        of your beloved Father. Soon the inheritance of His glorious promise will 
        be due. But a little while, says the Word of the Lord, and He who is coming 
        shall come and His reward will be with Him. May the Almighty, merciful 
        God and Lord before whom you have bent your knees to His honor, and whom 
        according to your weakness you have sought, grant you a strong and patient 
        heart, a bearable pain, a joyous recovery, a gracious restoration, or 
        a godly departure through Christ Jesus whom we daily expect with you, 
        my beloved sister and child in Christ Jesus.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Secondly, I understand that 
        your conscience is troubled because you have not and do not now walk in 
        such perfection as the Scriptures hold before us. I write the following 
        to my faithful sister as a brotherly consolation from the true Word and 
        eternal truth of the Lord. The Scripture, says Paul, has concluded all 
        under sin. There is no man on earth, says Solomon, who does righteously 
        and sinneth not. At another place: A just man falleth seven times, and 
        riseth up again. Moses says: The Lord, the merciful God, merciful and 
        gracious, longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy 
        for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, before whom 
        there is none without sin. O dear sister, notice, he says, none are without 
        sin before God. And David says: Lord, enter not into judgment with thy 
        servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. And we read, 
        If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not). We are 
        all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness is as filthy rags. 
        Christ also said, There is none good but one, that is God. The evil which 
        I would not, that I do. In many things we all offend. If we say that we 
        have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Since it is plain from all 
        these Scriptures that we must all confess ourselves to be sinners, as 
        we are in fact; and since no one under heaven has perfectly fulfilled 
        the righteousness required of God but Christ Jesus alone; therefore none 
        can approach God, obtain grace, and be saved, except by the perfect righteousness, 
        atonement, and intercession of Jesus Christ, however godly, righteous, 
        holy, and unblamable he may be. We must all acknowledge, whoever we are, 
        that we are sinners in thought, word, and deed. Yes, if we did not have 
        before us the righteous Christ Jesus, no prophet nor apostle could be 
        saved.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Therefore be of good cheer 
        and comforted in the Lord. You can expect no greater righteousness in 
        yourself than all the chosen of God had in them from the beginning. In 
        and by yourself you are a poor sinner, and by the eternal righteousness 
        banished, accursed, and condemned to eternal death. But in and through 
        Christ you are justified and pleasing unto God, and adopted by Him in 
        eternal grace as a daughter and child. In this all saints have comforted 
        themselves, have trusted in Christ, have ever esteemed their own righteousness 
        as unclean, weak, and imperfect, have with contrite hearts approached 
        the throne of grace in the name of Christ and with firm faith prayed the 
        Father: O Father, forgive us our transgressions as we forgive those who 
        transgress against us. Matt. 6.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It is a very precious word 
        which Paul speaks, When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ 
        died for the ungodly. Yea, when we were yet ungodly, and thereby He manifests 
        His love toward us. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to 
        God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be 
        saved by his life. Rom. 5:6, 10. Behold, my chosen beloved child and sister 
        in the Lord, this I write from the very sure foundation of eternal truth.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I pray and desire that you 
        will betake yourself wholly both as to what is inward and what is outward 
        unto Christ Jesus and His merits, believing and confessing that His precious 
        blood alone is your cleansing; His righteousness your piety; His death 
        your life; and His resurrection your justification; for He is the forgiveness 
        of all your sins; His bloody wounds are your reconciliation; and His victorious 
        strength is the staff and consolation of your weakness, as we have formerly 
        according to our small gift often shown you from the Scriptures.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Yes, dearest child and sister, 
        seeing that you find and feel such a spirit in yourself desirous of following 
        that which is good, and abhorring that which is evil, even though the 
        remnant of sin is not entirely dead in you, as was also the case in all 
        the saints who lamented from the beginning, as was said, therefore you 
        may rest assured that you are a child of God and that you will inherit 
        the kingdom of grace in eternal joy with all the saints. Hereby we know 
        that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 
        I John 4:13.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I sincerely pray that you 
        may by faith rightly understand this basis of comfort, strengthening, 
        and consolation of your distressed conscience and soul, and remain firm 
        unto the end. I commend you, most beloved child and sister, to the faithful, 
        merciful, and gracious God in Christ Jesus, now and forever. Let Him do 
        with you and with all of us according to H is blessed will, whether in 
        the flesh to remain a little longer with your beloved husband and children; 
        or out of the flesh to the honor of His name and to the salvation of your 
        soul. You go before and we follow, or we go before and you follow. Separation 
        must sometime come.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In the city of God, in the 
        new Jerusalem, there we will await each other, before the throne of God 
        and of the Lamb, sing Hallelujah, and praise His name in perfect joy. 
        Your husband and children I commend to Him who has given them to you, 
        and He will take care of them. The saving power of the most holy blood 
        of Christ be with my most beloved child and sister, now and forever, Amen.

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your brother who sincerely 
        loves you in Christ."</font>

        <em>The Complete Writings of Menno Simons</em>, C. 1496-1567 (Scottdale, 
            Penn.: Herald Press, 1956), pp.1052-1054.<br>
        <sup>2</sup> One of the most beautiful letters of Menno was addressed 
            to the wife of Rein Edes. In the Dutch original her name is given as Griet, 
            and K. Vos states (<em>Menno Simons</em>, 1914, 290) that she was Menno's 
            sister-in-law. The occasion for the letter was the information which came 
            to Menno that she was troubled by the depravity within her; she longed 
            for greater holiness, and was disturbed at her inability to attain it. 
            Menno attempts to comfort and strengthen her, reminding her that all the 
            saints of history had the same struggles and the same longings, and directing 
            her to the perfect merits and righteousness of Jesus Christ. In the <em>Opera 
            Omnia Theologica</em> of 1681 the letter is printed, fol. 434, and in 
            the <em>Complete Works</em> of 1871, Part II, 401, 402. Vos assigns the 
        letter to about the year 1557. </font></font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font>
