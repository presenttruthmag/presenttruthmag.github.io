          False Gospel According to the Holiness Movement</FONT>&nbsp;<BR> <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Protestant, 
            Catholic and Pentecostal historians all recognize that the modern 
            charismatic movement has its roots in the holiness movement. Pentecostalism 
            is the logical and inevitable extension of "holiness" theology. For 
            this reason, <em>Present Truth Magazine</em> will devote this issue 
            to an appraisal of the "holiness" doctrine.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will quote at length 
            from two "holiness" books which are still being circulated in the 
            United States. Just as there are many types of Pentecostal ism, so 
            there are many types of "holiness" doctrine. But all "holiness" teaching 
            is clearly distinguished by one characteristic: rather than allowing 
            holiness of life to appear in its true order as the fruit of preaching 
            the gospel, the attainment to holiness of life is the "holiness" gospel.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first presentation, 
            by John Morgan, proposes such a state of holiness of life as a condition 
            for being justified that it is certain no sinner could ever attain 
            to justification by following out the condition. Morgan's teaching 
            is a far cry from St. Paul's message that God justifies the ungodly 
            who believe (Rom. 4:5)</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second presentation, 
            by C.W. Ruth, proposes that the attainment of the "second blessing" 
            (which is supposed to eradicate inbred sin) is a condition of retaining 
            the blessing of justification. It is certain that no believer could 
            retain his justification upon the condition set forth by this "holiness" 
            author.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neither author has anything 
            to say about God's saving act in Christ. God's redeeming work outside 
            of the poor sinner is not that to which his hope is directed, but 
            it is made to rest on the work of grace inside of himself. This doctrine 
            is the old Romanism dressed up in a few Protestant revivalist trappings.</font>

            from <em>Holiness Acceptable to God</em>, by John Morgan<sup>1</sup></font></B></font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Morgan was a lifelong 
            friend of Charles G. Finney and textual advisor at Oberlin College. 
            Finney held Morgan's presentation in such high regard that he included 
            it in the original edition of his <em>Systematic Theology</em>, volume 
            2. This presentation represents the theological viewpoint of one of 
            America's most renowned revivalists. As well as teaching that the 
            believer's perfect obedience to the law is a condition of justification, 
            the Finney school took issue with the Reformers' doctrine that all 
            good works of the saints, being defiled with human imperfection, cannot 
            satisfy the claims of God's law. We wonder whether the Finney school 
            was aware that their arguments were substantially the same as the 
            arguments used by the Roman Catholics who opposed Luther and Calvin.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Says John Morgan:</font>
          <ul>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">" 'Wherewith shall 
            I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the High God?' This 
            has in all ages been the solemn and anxious inquiry of earnest souls. 
            It is the question of one who has sinned&mdash;the question, however, of 
            hope and not of despair; the question of one who conceives that perhaps 
            the High and Holy One may be acceptably approached. But the inquiry 
            presupposes that whatever God may have done, may be doing, or is ready 
            to do for his salvation, the inquirer has a personal responsibility 
            which he must meet, that there are conditions which he must fulfill. 
            What shall I do to inherit eternal life? The question recognizes the 
            moral agency of the inquirer and the necessity of its appropriate 
            exercise.<br>
            </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            </font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It is admitted by all, except utter antinomians, 
              that some degree of holiness or conformity to the divine law is 
              indispensable to acceptance with God.<sup><strong>2</strong></sup> No one, we think, 
              would refuse to unite with the venerable Westminster Confession 
              in the statement that 'repentance, by which a sinner so grieves 
              for and hates his sins as to turn from them all to God, purposing 
              and endeavoring to walk with Him in all the ways of His commandments, 
              is of such necessity to all sinners, that none may expect pardon 
              without it.'</font>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P><font size="2">"Still, the majority of the church would doubtless, 
              with the Larger Westminster Catechism, maintain that the 'best works' 
              of God's accepted saints, 'are imperfect and defiled in the sight 
              of God.' The celebrated Dr. Beecher in his recent letter on Perfection 
              exhibits the theory which he has embraced on the subject. We will 
              quote a few of his questions and answers.</font>
            <P><font size="2">"Question 1. What takes place in regeneration?</font>
            <P><font size="2">"Answer. The reconciliation of an enemy to God; 
              submission to his will; love to God more than to all creatures and 
              all things. In its commencement, this love is feeble compared with 
              'all the heart, mind, soul and strength,' according to the moral 
              law; and to qualify for heaven, must be progressively augmented 
              through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.</font>
            <P><font size="2">"Question 2. How can the help of Christ be obtained, 
              to secure our growth in grace?</font>
            <P><font size="2">"Answer. By renouncing all reliance upon our own 
              strength and merits, and relying entirely on the sufficiency and 
              willingness of Christ to help us, sought by filial supplication, 
              and the diligent use of the appointed means of grace; striving, 
              as the Puritan writers say, as if all depended on ourselves, and 
              looking to Christ as if all depended on him.</font>
            <P><font size="2">"Question 3. What will be the effect of such a prayerful 
              reliance upon Christ, in the diligent use of the means of grace?</font>
            <P><font size="2">"Answer. Not perfection; for faith can be no more 
              perfect than the love which animates it; and not including love 
              with all the heart, and mind, and soul, and strength is always an 
              implication of defect needing an advocate and pardon. The child 
              who cannot go a step alone may as well exult in the claim of perfect 
              manhood, as those who can do nothing without Christ, in the claim 
              of perfection. But the result will be that they will grow in grace 
              till they die, going from strength to strength, till they all appear 
              in Zion before God.</font>
            <P><font size="2">"The doctrine of these extracts clearly is not simply 
              that the love of a newborn saint is feeble compared with that of 
              an advanced Christian but that it is less than the moral law requires, 
              and therefore sinfully defective. These extracts also teach that 
              'the most prayerful reliance on Christ and the most diligent use 
              of the means of grace' ever practiced in this life never produce 
              an obedience which does not itself, because of sinful defect, need 
              pardon.</font>
            <P><font size="2">"In these views Dr. Beecher coincides with the representation 
              of the Westminster Confession, that 'they who in their obedience 
              attain to the greatest height which is possible in this life . . 
              . fall short in much which in duty they are bound to do.'</font>
            <P><font size="2">"We propose to seek a scriptural answer to the inquiry: 
              Is any degree of holiness acceptable to God, which, for the time 
              being, falls short of full obedience to the divine law? We put the 
              question into the most general form, intending it to apply to both 
              the accepted holiness of the newborn soul and the holiness of the 
              most mature Christian."</font>
            <P><font size="2">". . . we proceed more directly to the question 
              whether full obedience to its [the law's) requisitions is a condition 
              of acceptance with God. Those who believe that 'the best works of 
              justified persons are defiled in the sight of God' cannot believe 
              that full obedience to the divine law is a present condition of 
              the divine favor."</font>
            <P><font size="2">". . . nothing can be plainer than this that such 
              passages as Micah 6:8 speak of a condition on which sinners may 
              approach God acceptably. A serious inquirer is introduced as asking, 
              'Wherewith shall I come before the Lord and bow myself before the 
              High God? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves 
              of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, 
              or with tens of thousands of rivers of oil! Shall I give my first-born 
              for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?' 
              Can anything be more manifest than this, that these are the questions 
              of a sinner?</font>
            <P><font size="2">"Let us hear again the answer of the inspired prophet: 
              'He hath showed thee, 0 man, what is good; and what doth the Lord 
              require of thee but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk 
              humbly with thy God?' He presents to him the whole compass of duty, 
              and encourages him with no hint that he may come before the Lord 
              and bow himself before the High God with a partial performance of 
              this duty."</font>
            <P><font size="2">"The Bible declares of saints that they have actually 
              rendered full obedience. It is said of Caleb (Num. 14:24), 'My servant 
              Caleb, because he had another spirit with him and hath followed 
              me fully, him will I bring into the land that he hath trodden upon 
              and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the Lord' (Deut. 
              1:36).</font>
            <P><font size="2">"Of Joshua and Caleb (Num. 32:12), it is said: 'They 
              have wholly followed the Lord.' The same language is employed with 
              respect to David (I Kings 11:6). God sentences the Israelites in 
              the wilderness: 'Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt 
              from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware 
              unto Abraham, unto Isaac and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly 
              followed me' (Num. 32:11). Solomon is sentenced(I Kings 11:11; compare 
              verse 11) to lose his kingdom because 'he went not after the Lord 
              fully as did David his father,' and thus failed 'to keep the Lord's 
              covenant.'</font>
            <P><font size="2">"The original Hebrew phrase in all these places 
              is the same, though translated into somewhat different English. 
              Gesenius, surpassed by no one in Hebrew lexicography, explains the 
              phrase to mean 'to yield God full obedience.' Leopold in his lexicon 
              renders it 'integra obedientia Jovam sequi,' that is, to follow 
              Jehovah with entire obedience.</font>
            <P><font size="2">"In reference to David, God says to Jeroboam, 'Thou 
              hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and 
              who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right 
              in mine eyes' (I Kings 14:8). It is recorded of Jehoshaphat (II 
              Chron. 22:9) that 'he sought the Lord with all his heart.' Of Josiah 
              the inspired record is, ' And like unto him was there no king before 
              him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his 
              soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses, 
              neither after him arose there any like him' (II Kings 23:25)..."</font>
            <P><font size="2">"Bible saints professed this entire obedience. Thus 
              Caleb says to Joshua, 'My brethren that went up with me, made the 
              heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed the Lord my God' 
              (Josh. 14:8). 'I beseech thee, 0 Lord,' says Hezekiah (II Kings 
              20:3), 'remember how I have walked before thee in truth and with 
              a perfect heart.' It is remarkable that the lexicographers Gesenius, 
              Leopold, and Gibbs, in explaining the word shaulem, give both the 
              general signification, perfect, entire, consummate, and in reference 
              to the relation of men to God make it signify at peace or on good 
              terms with Him.</font>
            <P><font size="2">"In Psalm 119:10, 58, 145, the Psalmist professes, 
              'With my whole heart have I sought thee; 0 let me not wander from 
              thy commandments. . . . I entreated thy favor with my whole heart; 
              be merciful unto me according to thy word. . . . I cried with my 
              whole heart; hear me; I will keep thy statutes.' It may be thought 
              that historians or poets in describing the characters or conduct 
              of others would resort to the language of hyperbole; but do the 
              modest, humble saints employ hyperbolical expressions in telling 
              of their own conduct and exercises? Do they magnify their own earnestness 
              and faithfulness or use the words of simple truth? Two remarks we 
              will make on the passages from the Psalmist: (a) He founds on his 
              wholehearted seeking and prayers a covenant claim to be heard, to 
              be made a subject of mercy and grace. (b) His belief of his own 
              wholeheartedness did not make him self-confident or presumptuous. 
              '0 let me not wander from thy commandments' is anything but the 
              language of a self-confident spirit."</font>
            <P><font size="2">"We request our readers to consider attentively 
              such passages as declare: . . . (a) that we cannot serve God and 
              Mammon; (b) that we must hate our nearest friends and forsake all 
              that we have in order to be Christ's disciples; (c) that we must 
              sell all that we have in order to buy the field with the treasure 
              hid in it, or to obtain the pearl of great price; (d) that the violator 
              of one commandment is guilty of all; (e) that the accepted Christian 
              is free from sin, dead and buried to sin&mdash;that he is risen to righteousness; 
              (f) that to him who is in Christ Jesus old things are passed away 
              and all things become new. Let these passages be examined with their 
              context, and it will be seen that they entirely harmonize with the 
              numerous texts quoted from the Old Testament.</font>
            <P><font size="2">"On Matthew 5:24 we quote from the Commentary of 
              Calvin, one of the ablest and most spiritual of expositors, and 
              on the whole decidedly our own favorite. The extracts are instructive, 
              both as showing the force with which such passages strike pious 
              minds, in theory opposed to their teachings, and as giving a specimen 
              of the best shifts by which they try to dispose of their natural 
              import. 'Christ denies that it can be that any one should obey God 
              and his flesh at the same time. . . Since God everywhere commends 
              sincerity, while a double heart is abominable, all those are deceived 
              who think he will be contented with half of their heart. All, indeed, 
              confess with the mouth, that God is not truly worshipped except 
              with entire affection, but they deny it in reality, while they study 
              to reconcile things contrary to each other. I will not cease, says 
              the ambitious man, to serve God, although I apply a good part of 
              my mind to the chase of honors. . .</font>
            <P><font size="2">'It is true, indeed, that believers themselves never 
              are so entirely given to obedience to God but what they are drawn 
              from it by the vicious desires of the flesh. But because they groan 
              under this miserable bondage, and are displeased with themselves, 
              and do not serve the flesh otherwise than unwilling and reluctant 
              (inviti et reluctantes)&mdash;they are not said to serve two masters, 
              because their purposes and efforts are approved by the Lord, just 
              as if they rendered him an entire obedience. But here the hypocrisy 
              of those persons is exposed, who flatter themselves in vices, as 
              if they could conjoin light with darkness.'</font>
            <P><font size="2">"We ask, where in the whole compass of the Bible 
              are saints said to be thus distinguishable from sinners? Where are 
              they said to sin 'unwillingly and reluctantly'&mdash;while none of the 
              ungodly are reluctant about it? We know of no texts which can under 
              any pretense be cited to sustain such a view, except the contested 
              passages in Romans 7 and Galatians 5&mdash;with respect to the first of 
              which we cannot but concur with Tholuck in the remark that 'if the 
              least attention is paid to the connection of this section of chapter 
              7 with that which precedes and that which follows, it is not possible 
              to explain it of any other than a person standing under the law.' 
              "</font>
            <P><font size="2">"The great Edwards is not always consistent with 
              himself, nor are his professed disciples. Thus they all insist that 
              no one can be a good Christian who does not intend or aim at sinless 
              perfection, or, as the Westminster Confession has it, 'purpose and 
              endeavor to walk with God in all the ways of his commandments.' 
              Yet they also insist that it is dangerous error, if not heresy, 
              to believe that anyone ever really fully obeys God. All Christians 
              have the will for it but never do it. 'If there be a full compliance 
              of will,' says Edwards, 'the person has done his duty; and if other 
              things do not prove to be connected with his volition, that is not 
              owing to him.' "</font>
            <P><font size="2">"It would appear that in the apostle's [Paul's] 
              view we must be conformed to the law in order to please God. And 
              how shall he 'who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, and

            <p><font size="2">". . . The whole argument of Paul, in the 6th, 7th

            <P><font size="2">"We are well aware of the interpretation of Romans 
              7:7-25 still current among Calvinistic writers in England and America. 
              It is an interpretation which, beginning with Augustine, spread 
              through his great influence extensively in the church, and gained 
              still further vogue by the adoption and sanction of the reformers 
              Calvin and Luther. But until Augustine broached it, so far as history 
              informs us, the church knew nothing of it. By the whole early church, 
              learned and unlearned, the passage was referred to as the experience 
              of a sinner under the law. Notwithstanding the venerable authority 
              of the reformers and the high esteem in which they are held by evangelical 
              men the world over, the whole body of pious German commentators, 
              several of the most distinguished in Scotland and England, and Professors 
              Stuart and Robinson in America have been compelled by the apostle's 
              argument, in spite of theological bias, to return to the ancient 
              interpretation.</font>
            <P><font size="2">"With the exception of the Methodist commentators, 
              we see not how these learned men can be plausibly charged with adopting 
              their views from theological prejudice, inasmuch as they all, so 
              far as we know, held or hold the doctrine of the constant moral 
              imperfection of Christians. Hence Professor Hodge of Princeton in 
              his able work on Romans, while tenaciously cleaving to the current 
              view among Calvinists, says: 'There is nothing in this opinion which 
              implies the denial or disregard of any of the fundamental principles 
              of evangelical religion.'"</font>
            <P><font size="2">"The doctrine with which we are at present concerned 
              is not that of the simplicity of moral actions, nor that of the 
              constant sinlessness of such as have been converted, but simply 
              this, that nothing short of present entire conformity to the divine 
              law is accepted of God. Now, we admit, that if it could be made 
              out that the Scriptures represent the saints as constantly' sinful, 
              that would be fatal to our view, though then we should be at a loss 
              to interpret the numerous texts we have cited so as to make them 
              harmonize with the texts adduced against us."</font></font>

            approach than John Morgan. Whereas Morgan advocates the attainment 
            of a certain degree of holiness as a necessary condition to obtain 
            justification, Ruth takes a position that is more widely held &mdash; he 
            advocates the attainment of a certain degree of holiness as a necessary 
            condition to retain justification.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Says C.W. Ruth:</font>
          <ul>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">". . . sanctification 
            is an experience subsequent to regeneration, conditioned upon entire 
            consecration and faith, the privilege of every believer, to be experienced 
            and enjoyed in this life. That by the baptism with the Holy Ghost 
            inbred sin is destroyed and the heart perfected in love. The people 
            holding this theory are the only people who, personally, have any 
            experience or testimony to sanctification. These believe that sin 
            has never gone so deep into the soul, but that the blood of Jesus 
            can go deeper. 'That where sin abounded grace did much more abound.' 
            Jesus believed sanctification a divine act, for He prayed the Father 
            to sanctify the disciples, John 17:17. Indeed, the Trinity enters 
            into our sanctification. God the Father wills our sanctification, 
            I Thess. 4:3. In order to provide our sanctification Jesus suffered 
            without the gate, Heb. 13:12. And the Holy Ghost witnesses to our 
            sanctification, Heb. 10:14, 15. It is said of Bible saints, they were 
            'sanctified by God the Father,' Jude 1:1; also that Jesus sanctifies, 
            Eph. 5:25-27; and of the offering up of the Gentiles it was said they 
            were 'sanctified by the Holy Ghost,' Rom. 15:16. In Acts 26:l8 we 
            find that sanctification is obtained by faith. Seeing it is a work 
            that God must do for us, we need not wait for growth, death or purgatory, 
            but may by faith enter this blessed experience the instant the consecration 
            is entire and complete. While there is a gradual approach to the experience 
            from the human side, the divine work is instantaneous. Hallelujah!"</font>

              is the 'second blessing' exactly in the same sense that justification 
              is the first blessing. Justification is the first blessing that 
              changes our moral condition and our personal relation toward God. 
              In justification we are changed from the attitude and relation of 
              enemies and rebels toward God into that of obedient children. It 
              certainly is a blessing&mdash;but it is more, it is a grace that transforms 
              and transposes into a permanent state and experience. Until this 
              experience, all other blessings left the individual in the same 
              moral condition they had found him. So, after a person is fully 
              justified, he may receive not only many temporal, but many spiritual 
              blessings&mdash;prayermeeting and campmeeting blessings&mdash;which will greatly 
              refresh, and help, and encourage, and yet they will not eradicate 
              inbred sin, and make him holy; if he was given to fear or impatience 
              or doubt, or any other carnal manifestations, those same conditions 
              will continue to exist after the 'hundreds of blessings' have come

              justification is the first blessing that effects a permanent inward 
              change, so sanctification is the 'second blessing,' hence, 'properly 
              so called.' While justification comprehends pardon, regeneration 
              and adoption, making us children of God, sanctification comprehends 
              the full eradication of the carnal mind, the inbred sin, and the 
              baptism and anointing with the Holy Ghost, making us kings and priests 
              unto God. Whereas justification delivers us from sins committed, 
              sin as an act, sanctification delivers us from the sin-nature inherited-sin 
              as a principle; justification delivers us from guilt and condemnation 
              while sanctification delivers us from unholy appetites; the first 
              gives us the birth of the Spirit; the second, the baptism with the

              and crisis in the life of those receiving it, just so certainly 
              sanctification marks a second epoch, a second crisis, a second experience,

              the subject of original sin in its creed, in some form or other, 
              and so, clearly distinguishes between it&mdash;the sin-nature inherited&mdash;and 
              sin as an act committed. That all men are born into this world with 
              this 'Adamic taint,' this 'infection of nature,' this 'inbred sin'; 
              or, as it is termed in the Scriptures, the 'carnal mind,' 'our old

              sin'&mdash;cannot enter heaven, and therefore must be eradicated from 
              the soul before there is perfect fitness for a holy heaven. The 
              points of controversy are concerning the time and method for the 
              accomplishment of this deliverance; the Calvinistic, Zinzendorfian, 
              Keswickian theory being that this full deliverance cannot be fully 
              realized until death; hence the only hope for the Christian in this 
              life is to obtain grace to repress, subdue, regulate, control and 
              overcome this evil within until death shall set us free. The Arminian, 
              Wesleyan and present-day second-blessing, holiness-movement theory 
              is, that subsequent to regeneration, by a complete consecration 
              and faith, there may be an instantaneous cleansing and eradication 
              of all sin from the heart of the believer by the baptism with the 
              Holy Ghost and fire."</font>
            <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Some have supposed 
              that this inbred sin was removed in regeneration, but this is contrary 
              to the experience of all Christians in all ages, and is contrary 
              to the teachings of the Bible. While the Apostle Paul could say 
              of the Corinthians, 'I thank my God always on your behalf, for the 
              grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ,' and called them 
              'babes in Christ,' he also declared, 'ye are yet carnal' (Cor. 3:3), 
              which proves most conclusively that the carnal mind was not eradicated 
              at the time of their conversion.</font>
            <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Others seem 
              to think that by some mysterious process of growth the soul may 
              advance until in some inexplicable manner, just about the time death 
              might ensue, it would develop into a state of perfect holiness, 
              and so have deliverance from the evil within. Just how, or by what 
              law, the growth of a child would remove uncleanness, or the growth 
              of the vegetable in the garden would at the same time grow out or 
              destroy the weeds in the garden, is not explained. However, in the 
              advancement of this theory there is the recognition of the sin-nature 
              remaining in the heart after regeneration. Though the deliverance 
              from it were only fully realized and accomplished at the time of 
              death, it would nevertheless be a second or subsequent experience 
              to regeneration.</font>
            <P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Paul seemed 
              to anticipate the repression theory in Rom. 6:1,2, when he exclaimed: 
              'What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may 
              abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any 
              longer therein?' He then continues by declaring that the divine 
              method for inbred sin&mdash;'our old man,' or, 'the body of sin'&mdash;is crucifixion 
              and destruction. 'Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with 
              him, that the body of sin might be destroyed.' 'Crucified' and 'destroyed'

              is dying, surely it has the same efficacy prior to death. Thank 
              God for the promise, 'If we walk in the light, as he is in the light,

            or inbred sin is crucified and eradicated by the baptism with the 
            Holy Ghost. The negative side of sanctification, which is the destruction 
            and removal of inbred sin, is as certainly effected by the Holy Ghost 
            as is the positive side of sanctification, which is the divine infilling 
            and the enduement of power. Multitudes are praying for power and so 
            insist on having the positive side of sanctification without consenting 
            to have the negative work of cleansing accomplished in them. All such 
            seeking is in vain. The work of subtracting inbred sin from the heart 
            must precede addition or the enduement of power. Purity is power."<br>

            <P><font size="2">"The difference of the craving and longing of a 
              justified soul and that of a sanctified soul may be illustrated 
              by the person having a craving or appetite for apple dumplings, 
              or some special dish,&mdash;he may sit up to a table laden with good things, 
              and eat all he may wish; but that one dish he was especially craving 
              is not on the table; although he has had a full meal, he is still 
              craving something not contained in that meal. Thus it is with the 
              justified soul; he may be blessed even to the shouting point, and 
              still crave something not contained in that blessing. But when he 
              is sanctified wholly he gets the apple dumplings, or the very thing 
              he was craving. That special longing having been satisfied, having 
              received not only all he wanted, but the very thing his nature craved&mdash;his 
              hungering and thirsting are just as though he had apple dumplings 
              for every meal. Thus it is with the sanctified soul. He is not wanting 
              or desiring something other than what he has, although at the next 
              meal time he will relish some more of the same kind. Because justification 
              does not and cannot satisfy the longing of the heart for holiness, 
              they try so-called 'innocent' and 'no-harm' amusements, etc., and 
              backslide. Whereas, if they were properly instructed, and would 
              seek entire sanctification they would find what their heart is craving, 
              and hence have entire satisfaction."</font>
            <P><font size="2">"The common experience of Christians is that while 
              carnality is yet in the heart, 'the flesh lusteth against the spirit, 
              and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one 
              to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.' Because 
              of this inward conflict and struggle, they frequently suffer defeat, 
              and realize that they do things they did not mean to do, and leave 
              undone the things they meant to do, and so have an up and down life 
              of sinning and repenting. The bedside of multitudes is transformed 
              into a mourner's bench, where they are obliged to go every night 
              before they retire and weep and repent over their failures during 
              the day. Under certain temptations and provocations the carnality 
              in their hearts had gained the ascendency and had betrayed them 
              into wrong feelings and tempers, and so defeated them. After they 
              had spent some time at their 'mourner's bench,' and wept and prayed, 
              they again felt that the pardoning grace and smile of God was in 
              their hearts, and resolved to do better the next day, only to find 
              that the same disturber of the peace and source of trouble was still 
              in their hearts. But after they were sanctified wholly, and the 
              carnal nature destroyed and eradicated from their hearts, they ceased 
              doing things they should not do, and leaving undone things they 
              should do, and found they had in their hearts the grace and power 
              to perform all the will of God, which made them 'more than conquerors,' 
              and put the real swing of victory into their souls. So instead of 
              going to the 'mourner's bench' before retiring at night, they simply 
              climbed up into the choir-loft and got out their 'cornet, flute, 
              harp, sackbut, psaltery and dulcimer, and all kinds of music,' and 
              sang and shouted their glad doxologies of praise to God for the 
              'keeping power' and the glorious victories of another day. Just 
              as certain as the foundation preserves the building, just so certainly 
              the building preserves the foundation; and just so surely does the 
              experience of sanctification preserve or enable one to maintain 
              the experience of justification. Blessed be God!"</font></font>
