          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="6-1a.gif" alt="Church Buildings" width=600 height=250 border=0 align="right">In the preceding 
            issue of <em>Present Truth Magazine</em> ("Justification by Faith 
            and the Charismatic Movement"), we examined the Pentecostal movement 
            in the light of the evangel of the apostles and Reformers. Weighed 
            in the balances of the gospel, the movement was found wanting. But 
            we hasten to point out that we cannot wash our own hands in innocency 
            nor even patronizingly say, "There go I but for the grace of God."</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The charismatic movement 
            has its roots in all the established churches. We may take pride in 
            our orthodoxy and detest the pretensions of the gift of tongues, but, 
            as Protestant bodies in general, we have operated the breeding grounds 
            of Pentecostalism. The self-condemning truth may not be welcome. Israel 
            could cheer Amos as long as he was rebuking the sins of Damascus, 
            Gaza, Ashkelon, Edom or Moab (see Amos 1 and 2). But when he finally 
            got around to saying, "Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions 
            of Israel, and for four. . . ," they were quick to think of ways to 
            get the humble herdsman back to Tekoa.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">The Heresy 
            of Formal Orthodoxy</font></B></font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those who are fiercely 
            loyal to orthodox Protestantism should realize that sometimes formal 
            orthodoxy is the worst of all heresies. The period that followed the 
            Reformers was known as the period of orthodoxy. While it produced 
            some good theology, it produced a dead church and made the reaction 
            of Pietism inevitable.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Orthodoxy tends to confound 
            correctness of belief and saving faith. It confuses its statement 
            of truth with the living Truth itself. Faith is directed to an orthodox 
            body of doctrine more than to the person of Jesus Christ. Thus faith 
            becomes intellectualized. This process happened in the early church 
            after the apostles passed off the stage. It also happened after the 
            generation of the Reformers.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A minister once asked a 
            celebrated actor why people crowded the theater and stage instead 
            of the church. He replied, "You preachers talk about real things as 
            if they were imaginary, but we talk about imaginary things as if they 
            were real."</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many people cannot endure 
            the dead formality of the "good old" church. Some of them have endured 
            religion as a child endures medicine &mdash; it is awful to take. Now there 
            appears to be some life and vitality in the charismatic movement. 
            Who can blame them for becoming disillusioned with churches where 
            sleepy preachers preach to sleepy people?</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In view of the threat, 
            many ministers are adopting the motto, "If you can't beat them, join 
            them." So they think it expedient to bring the whole charismatic circus, 
            with its religious rock, tongues and fantastic religious hallucinations, 
            right into the church.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, some ministers 
            do not intend to compete with the "instant prophets" in their churches. 
            They are determined to keep to the "good old path." Unfortunately, 
            they may be left chasing the devil on a bicycle while he is in an 
            airplane. </font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Pentecostalism may be 
            a plague and a heresy, but is it any worse than a dead orthodoxy, 
            where scarcely the living breath of heaven ever stirs? How can we 
            self-righteously condemn Pentecostal ism when we breed Pentecostalism? 
            </font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Lack 
            of Gospel Zeal</font></B></font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Enthusiasm</em> has become a 
            bad word in most orthodox circles. It conjures up visions of the radical 
            evangelicals of the sixteenth century (whom Luther called "the enthusiasts"), 
            hotheaded revivalists within the holiness movement, and emotional 
            Pentecostals. Suppose we could listen to the first Christians proclaim 
            the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. Would it not be possible 
            that we would charge them, as Robert Walpole charged Wesley, with 
            a "very ugly enthusiasm"?</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The editors of<em> Present 
            Truth Magazine</em> submit that the apostle Paul did not turn the 
            world upside down by giving dry (though correct) theological lectures. 
            His was a living, moving message of a crucified, risen and returning 
            Saviour. He spoke with a passion of soul as well as in the power of 
            the Spirit. The disciples who discovered Jesus after their walk to 
            Emmaus, did not bore the other disciples with a homily of "firstly," 
            "secondly" and "thirdly."</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We should make no apologies 
            for declaring that the gospel is still the most exciting news ever 
            heard among men. Jesus is the Pearl of great price; the gospel is 
            a treasure hid in a field. Christ has taken away sin, conquered death 
            and given us eternal life. Who can sincerely declare this without 
            enthusiasm?</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let it be remembered that 
            Laodicea, the last Apocalyptic church, is condemned, not for heresy, 
            but for having no fire in her soul. She is neither cold nor hot, and 
            the divine Lover is nauseated. He reproves her for lack of zeal (Rev. 
            3:19).</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The healthy enthusiasm 
            that Christ calls for in His last message to His church is not to 
            be confused with Pentecostal enthusiasm. Pentecostals rave about what 
            they suppose the Spirit is doing in their lives. To use the words 
            of one publication, "The Jesus kids are very excited about what the 
            Holy Spirit is doing in their lives." This sort of enthusiasm is unhealthy 
            because it is so subjective, introspective, and uplifting to the ego. 
            (Pride is never so high as when it has a startling religious experience 
            to relate.) Now it cannot be denied that the apostles were enthusiastic. 
            But their enthusiasm was in something objective. Theirs was the good 
            news of what God had done for them in Christ. "And with great power 
            gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus." 
            Acts 4:33.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gospel is still tidings 
            of great joy for all people (Luke 2:10). The alternatives should not 
            be lukewarm Christianity or the enthusiasm of Pentecostalism. The 
            question should be whether our enthusiasm is in our own experience 
            or in the glory of God's saving activity in Christ.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Failure 
            to Uphold the Centrality of Justification by Faith</font></B></font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is well known that Luther 
            described the doctrine of justification by faith as <em>articulus 
            stantis vel cadentis ecclesiae,</em> the article of faith that decides 
            whether the church is standing or falling. It is not sufficient to 
            have it stated as one of the doctrines in our creed. Luther meant 
            that it was to be the central truth that swallowed up every other. 
            Many will profess to believe in justification by faith. They may sound 
            quite correct; but for them it is only the initial step in the Christian 
            life. It ceases to be the center; for other things, like Christian 
            experience, sanctification or the Spirit-filled life, subordinate 
            justification in their thinking, writing and preaching.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>The New Catholic Encyclopedia</em> 
            points out that Protestantism today still teaches justification by 
            faith but that its place and emphasis are generally a far cry from 
            the place and emphasis given it by the Reformers. How true! American 
            Protestantism, generally speaking, has forgotten the real theology 
            of justification. The emphasis is so orientated toward experience 
            that most Protestants do not know the difference between the outside 
            work of God's justifying verdict upon the fallen sinner and the inward 
            change of the new birth wrought by the Holy Spirit.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primacy and centrality 
            of justification by an extrinsic (outside) righteousness up in heaven 
            is almost like a new language to many today. Some have so concentrated 
            on the inward experience of being born again (trying to find their 
            eternal security in the inward experience of the new birth) that they 
            have almost no theology of justification. Others often get hung up 
            on the definition which relegates justification "for the sins of the 
            past." Aside from the fact that this definition is based on a mistranslation 
            of Romans 3:25, it tends to subordinate justification to what is supposed 
            to be the "higher experience" of sanctification. Hence justification 
            is relegated to the past and fails to be an abiding, central truth.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">J.I. Packer has well said 
            in his introduction to a reprint of Buchanan's thesis on justification: 
            </font>
          <ul>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"If we may 
                judge by the size of its literary output, there has never been 
                an age of such feverish theological activity as the past hundred 
                years; yet amid all its multifarious theological concerns it did 
                not produce a single book of any size on the doctrine of justification. 
                If all we knew of the church during the past century was that 
                it had neglected the subject of justification in this way, we 
                should already be in a position to conclude that this has been 
                a century of religious apostasy and decline."&mdash;J.I. Packer,<em> 
                Introduction to The Doctrine of Justification</em>, by James Buchanan 
                (reprinted by The Banner of Truth Trust, 1961), p.2.</font> </p>
            </blockquote>
          </ul>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wherever and whenever the 
            truth of justification by faith is preached, the Holy Spirit is present 
            to renew God's people and to bring the breath of heaven into the church. 
            By it the garden of God is watered, new life springs up and fruit 
            is born to the glory of God. If we may reason from effect back to 
            cause, we may confidently say that the generally sad condition of 
            Protestantism is the result of a neglect of the truth of justification. 
            And for this we are being punished with the plague of Pentecostalism.</font>
          <P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Revivalist-Holiness 
            Mentality</strong> </font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some may be thinking, "Let 
            us meet the issue of Pentecostalism by having a revival in our church." 
            Aside from the vanity of men thinking that they can have a revival 
            in their church any time they choose (as if they can call in the Holy 
            Spirit like an obedient servant<sup>1</sup>), it should be observed that Pentecostal 
            ism is the end result of a revivalist mentality that has grown up 
            in Protestant America for more than one hundred years. Says Vinson 
            Synan in his recently published book, <em>The Holiness-Pentecostal 
            Movement in the United States</em>:</font>
          <ul>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The pentecostal movement 
              arose as a split in the holiness movement and can be viewed as the 
              logical outcome of the holiness crusade which had vexed American 
              Protestantism for forty years . . . &mdash;(Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. 
              Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1971), p.115.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Basically, the pentecostal 
              movement is an heir of the frontier, enthusiastic type of religion 
              that has been indigenous to the American religious experience. It 
              is probably the only large group in the United States that continues 
              to exhibit the fervor and enthusiasm so common during the Great 
              Awakening, the Kentucky revivals, and the Methodist camp meetings. 
              It also is an attempt to perpetuate the doctrine of perfectionism 
              which dominated Protestantism during the nineteenth century, as 
              well as the tradition of revivalism that loomed so large in the 
              last century and the early part of the twentieth century." &mdash;<em>Ibid</em>., 
              p.223. </font> </p>
          </ul>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the "good old" frontier 
            days, people received their religion with great color and excitement. 
            The essence of "good" preaching was to produce a great emotional response 
            from the congregation. Whether the preaching was for the first blessing 
            of conversion or the "second blessing" of full sanctification, the 
            overwhelming emphasis tended toward the attainment of an experience 
            that could be seen, heard or felt. The emphasis was on an empirical 
            experience rather than on the righteousness which is of faith, on 
            a subjective happening rather than on the objective gospel. As Catholic 
            scholar Louis Bouyer points out in <em>The Spirit and Forms of Protestantism</em>, 
            the revivals generally are the antithesis of the Reformation message 
            of justification by an imputed righteousness; in fact, as he further 
            points out, they are tending to bring the Protestant movement into 
            basic harmony with the Catholic Church. Pentecostalism merely carries 
            on the tradition of American revivalism, offering people the ultimate 
            of what many revivals have promised a tangible, empirical and exciting 
            religious happening. Revivalism, as generally carried on, breeds Pentecostalism, 
            even though the revivalist may violently oppose "tongues."</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The same thing may be said 
            about the holiness movement. Both Protestant and Catholic historians 
            recognize that the modern Pentecostal movement grew out of the holiness 
            movement which swept American Protestantism in the nineteenth century. 
            "Holiness" groups still exist; "holiness" theology and "holiness" 
            books are still being circulated by the millions today. The propagators 
            of the "holiness" emphasis may be opposed to Pentecostals, but the 
            fact is that, in their fundamental emphasis, their theology is the 
            same. They may differ in the form that the "second blessing" may take, 
            but the religious philosophy is the same.</font>
          <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Holiness" theology is 
            characterized by its supreme emphasis on Christian experience&mdash;"the 
            Spirit-filled life," "the victorious life," etc. God's work in man 
            supplants the gospel of God's work for man. Justification is not the 
            center of its message. Sanctification or the Spirit-filled life or 
            "Christ in you," etc., supplants the centrality of justification. 
            Often it takes the form of advocating a definite "second blessing," 
            something which is supposed to be much better and greater than justification. 
            The emphasis is orientated to man and to his experience. It is overwhelmingly 
            introspective and subjective. It sets people to earnestly watching 
            their spiritual temperature and constantly taking their spiritual 
            pulse. It has made its thousands of spiritual hypochondriacs. And 
            their witness is occupied with the "Christ" in them and the feelings 
            of sanctity or exploits of holiness he causes them to experience. 
            People who set out on this course can never be quite sure when they 
            have this special second blessing. Here Pentecostalism comes in to 
            provide a tangible answer. It proposes that the "second blessing" 
            may be known by the physically observable phenomenon of "speaking 
            in tongues." As long as revivalists and youth crusaders orientate 
            people toward their own experience, they will further the Pentecostal 
            movement even though they cry out ever so loudly against it.</font>
          <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, we say that, unless 
            we participate in a genuine awakening and recovery of the central 
            truth of the Reformation, we will have no resources before today's 
            onslaught of religious subjectivism. And if we betray the secret of 
            Protestantism's strength to the Delilah of ecumenism, we shall be 
            shorn and humiliated in the coming test of strength.</font>&nbsp;
