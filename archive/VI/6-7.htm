      <p><b><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My Conversion to God</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is my desire, in dependence 
              on the Lord, to write a faithful record, so far as memory now serves me, 
              of some of God's dealings with my soul and my strivings after the experience 
              of holiness, during the first six years of my Christian life, ere I knew 
              the blessedness of finding all in Christ. This will make it necessary 
              at times, I have little doubt, to 'speak as a fool'&mdash;even as the apostle 
              Paul did: but as I reflect on the need for such a record, I think I can 
        say with him, 'Ye have compelled me.'</font> </p>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If I may be privileged to 
        thereby save others from the unhappy experiences I passed through in those 
        early years, I shall feel abundantly repaid for the effort it will take 
        to thus put these heart-experiences before my readers.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. . . when the knowledge of 
        salvation was mine, I went at the first opportunity, the night after my 
        conversion, to an 'Army' street-meeting, and there spoke for the first 
        time, in the open air, of the grace of God so newly revealed to my soul.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. . . in my new-found joy 
        I had no conception that I still carried about with me a nature as sinful 
        and vile as existed in the breast of the greatest evildoer in the world. 
        I knew something of Christ and His love; I knew little or nothing of myself 
        and the deceitfulness of my own heart.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As nearly as I can now recollect, 
        I was in the enjoyment of the knowledge of God's salvation about a month 
        when, in some dispute with my brother, who was younger than I, my temper 
        suddenly escaped control, and in an angry passion I struck and felled 
        him to the ground. Horror immediately filled my soul. I needed not his 
        sarcastic taunt, 'Well, you are a nice Christian! You'd better go down 
        to the Army and tell what a saint you've become!' to send me to my room 
        in anguish of heart to confess my sin to God in shame and bitter sorrow, 
        as afterwards frankly to my brother, who generously forgave me.</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Holiness: 
        the Great Desideratum </font></B><em><font size="4"><font size="3">(</font></font><font size="3">definition: something 
        desired as essential &#8212; eds.)</font></em><font size="4"></font></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From this time on mine was 
        an 'up-and-down experience,' to use a term often heard in 'testimony meetings.' 
        I longed for perfect victory over the lusts and desires of the flesh. 
        Yet I seemed to have more trouble with evil thoughts and unholy propensities 
        than I had ever known before. For a long time I kept these conflicts hidden, 
        and known only to God and to myself. But after some eight to ten months, 
        I became interested in what were called 'holiness meetings,' held weekly 
        in the 'Army' hall, and also in a mission I sometimes attended. At these 
        gatherings an experience was spoken of which I felt was just what I needed. 
        It was designated by various terms: 'The Second Blessing'; 'Sanctification'; 
        'Perfect Love'; 'Higher Life'; 'Cleansing from Inbred Sin'; and by other 
        expressions.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Substantially, the teaching 
        was this: When converted, God graciously forgives all sins committed up 
        to the time when one repents. But the believer is then placed in a lifelong 
        probation, during which he may at any time forfeit his justification and 
        peace with God if he falls into sin from which he does not at once repent. 
        In order, therefore, to maintain himself in a saved condition, he needs 
        a further work of grace called sanctification. This work has to do with 
        sin the root, as justification had to do with sins the fruit.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The steps leading up to this 
        second blessing are, firstly, conviction as to the need of holiness (just 
        as in the beginning there was conviction of the need of salvation); secondly, 
        a full surrender to God, or the laying of every hope, prospect and possession 
        on the altar of consecration; thirdly, to claim in faith the incoming 
        of the Holy Spirit as a refining fire to burn out all inbred sin, thus 
        destroying in toto every lust and passion, leaving the soul perfect in 
        love and as pure as unfallen Adam. This wonderful blessing received, great 
        watchfulness is required lest, as the serpent beguiled Eve, he deceive 
        the sanctified soul, and thus introduce again the same kind of an evil 
        principle which called for such drastic action before.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such was the teaching; and 
        coupled with it were heartfelt testimonies of experiences so remarkable 
        that I could not doubt their genuineness, nor that what others seemed 
        to enjoy was likewise for me if I would fulfil the conditions.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One aged lady told how for 
        forty years she had been kept from sin in thought, word, and deed. Her 
        heart, she declared, was no longer 'deceitful above all things, and desperately 
        wicked,' but was as holy as the courts of heaven, since the blood of Christ 
        had washed away the last remains of inbred sin. Others spoke in a similar 
        way, though their experiences were much briefer. Bad tempers had been 
        rooted out when a full surrender was made. Evil propensities and unholy 
        appetites had been instantly destroyed when holiness was claimed by faith. 
        Eagerly I began to seek this precious boon of holiness in the flesh. Earnestly 
        I prayed for this Adamic sinlessness. I asked God to reveal to me every 
        unholy thing, that I might truly surrender all to Him. I gave up friends, 
        pursuits, pleasures&mdash;everything I could think of that might hinder the 
        incoming of the Holy Ghost and the consequent blessing. I was a veritable 
        'book-worm,' an intense love for literature possessing me from childhood; 
        but in my ignorant desire I put away all books of pleasurable or instructive 
        character, and promised God to read only the Bible and holiness writings 
        if He would only give me 'the blessing.' I did not, however, obtain what 
        I sought, though I prayed zealously for weeks.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At last, one Saturday night 
        (I was now away from home, living with a friend a member of the 'Army'), 
        I determined to go out into the country and wait on God, not returning 
        till I had received the blessing of perfect love. I took a train at eleven 
        o'clock, and went to a lonely station twelve miles from Los Angeles. There 
        I alighted, and, leaving the highway, descended into an empty arroyo, 
        or water-course. Falling on my knees beneath a sycamore tree, I prayed 
        in an agony for hours, beseeching God to show me anything that hindered 
        my reception of the blessing. Various matters of too private and sacred 
        a nature to be here related came to my mind. I struggled against conviction, 
        but finally ended by crying, 'Lord, I give up all&mdash;every thing, every person, 
        every enjoyment, that would hinder my living alone for Thee. Now give 
        me, I pray Thee, the blessing!'</font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I look back, I believe 
        I was fully surrendered to the will of God at that moment, so far as I 
        understood it. But my brain and nerves were unstrung by the long midnight 
        vigil and the intense anxiety of previous months, and I fell almost fainting 
        to the ground. Then a holy ecstasy seemed to thrill all my being. This 
        I thought was the coming into my heart of the Comforter. I cried out in 
        confidence, 'Lord, I believe Thou dost come in. Thou dost cleanse and 
        purify me from all sin. I claim it now. The work is done. I am sanctified 
        by Thy blood. Thou dost make me holy. I believe; I believe!' I was unspeakably 
        happy. I felt that all my struggles were ended.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With a heart filled with praise, 
        I rose from the ground and began to sing aloud. Consulting my watch, I 
        saw it was about half-past three in the morning. I felt I must hasten 
        to town so as to be in time for the seven o'clock prayer-meeting, there 
        to testify to my experience. Fatigued as I was by being up all night, 
        yet so light was my heart I scarcely noticed the long miles back, but 
        hastened to the city, arriving just as the meeting was beginning, buoyed 
        up by my new-found experience. All were rejoiced as I told what great 
        things I believed God had done for me. Every meeting that day added to 
        my gladness. I was literally intoxicated with joyous emotions.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My troubles were all ended 
        now. The wilderness was past, and I was in Canaan, feeding on the old 
        corn of the land. Nevermore should I be troubled by inward drawings toward 
        sin. My heart was pure. I had reached the desirable state of full sanctification. 
        With no foe within, I could direct all my energies toward vanquishing 
        the enemies without.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was what I thought. Alas, 
        how little did I know myself; much less the mind of God!</font>
      <P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Sunshine and Cl</B><strong>ouds</strong></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For some weeks after the eventful 
        experience before described, I lived in a dreamily-happy state, rejoicing 
        in my fancied sinlessness. One great idea had possession of my mind; and 
        whether at work or in my leisure hours, I thought of little else than 
        the wonderful event which had taken place. But gradually I began to 'come 
        back to earth,' as it were. I was now employed in a photographic studio, 
        where I associated with people of various tastes and habits, some of whom 
        ridiculed,some tolerated,and others sympathized with, my radical views 
        on things religious. Night after night I attended the meetings, speaking 
        on the street and indoors, and I soon noticed (and doubtless others did 
        too) that a change came over my 'testimonies.' Before, I had always held 
        up Christ, and pointed the lost to Him. Now, almost imperceptibly, my 
        own experience became my theme, and I held up myself as a striking example 
        of consecration and holiness! This was the prevailing characteristic of 
        the brief addresses made by most of the 'advanced' Christians in our company. 
        The youngest in grace magnified Christ. The 'sanctified' magnified themselves. 
        A favorite song will make this more manifest than any words of mine. It 
        is still widely used in Army meetings, and finds a place in their Song or Hymn books. I give only one verse as a specimen:</font>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"'Some people I 
          know don't live holy;<br>
          They battle with unconquered sin, Not daring to consecrate fully,<br>
          Or they full salvation would win.<br>
          With malice they have constant trouble, From doubting they long to be 
          free;<br>
          With most things about them they grumble; Praise God, this is not so 
          with ME!'</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Will the reader believe me 
        when I say that I sang this wretched doggerel without a thought of the 
        sinful pride to which it was giving expression? I considered it my duty 
        to continually direct attention to 'my experience of full salvation,' 
        as it was called. 'If you don't testify to it, you will lose the blessing,' 
        was accepted as an axiom among us.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As time went on, I began to 
        be again conscious of inward desires toward evil &mdash; of thoughts that were 
        unholy. I was nonplused. Going to a leading teacher for help, he said, 
        'These are but temptations. Temptation is not sin. You only sin if you 
        yield to the evil suggestion.' This gave me peace for a time. I found 
        it was the general way of excusing such evident movings of a fallen nature, 
        which was supposed to have been eliminated. But gradually I sank to a 
        lower and lower plane, permitting things I would once have shunned; and 
        I even observed that all about me did the same. The first ecstatic experiences 
        seldom lasted long. The ecstasy departed, and the 'sanctified' were in 
        very little different from their brethren who were supposed to be 'only 
        justified.' We did not commit overt acts of evil: therefore we were sinless. 
        Lust was not sin unless yielded to: so it was easy to go on testifying 
        that all was right.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My thoughts of sin, as well 
        as of holiness, were very unformed and imperfect. Therefore it was easy, 
        generally speaking, to think that I was living without the one, and manifesting 
        the other. When doubts assailed, I treated them as temptations of the 
        devil. If I became unmistakably conscious that I had actually sinned, 
        I persuaded myself that at least it was not willful, but rather a mistake 
        of the mind than an intentional error of the heart. Then I went to God 
        in confession, and prayed to be cleansed from secret faults.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Owing to a later low state 
        of spiritual experience,] I was tormented with the thought that I had 
        backslidden, and might be lost eternally after all my former happy experiences 
        of the Lord's goodness. Twice I slipped out of the building when all were 
        in bed, and made my way to a lonely spot where I spent the night in prayer, 
        beseeching God not to take His Holy Spirit from me, but to again cleanse 
        me fully from all inbred sin. Each time I 'claimed it by faith,' and was 
        brighter for a few weeks; but I inevitably again fell into doubt and gloom, 
        and was conscious of sinning both in thought and in word, and sometimes 
        in unholy actions, which brought terrible remorse.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again I spent the night in 
        prayer . . . [and believed) that the work of full inward cleansing was 
        indeed consummated, and that I was now, if never before, actually rid 
        of all carnality.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How readily one yields himself 
        to self-deception in a matter of this kind! From this time on I became 
        a more earnest advocate of the second blessing than ever; and I remember 
        that often I prayed God to give my dear mother the blessing He had given 
        me, and to make her as holy as her son had become. And that pious mother 
        had known Christ before I was born, and knew her own heart too well to 
        talk of sinlessness, though living a devoted, Christ-like life!</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. . . [I was] generally 
        confident that I was living out the doctrine of perfect love to God and 
        man, and thereby making my own final salvation more secure. And yet, as 
        I now look back, what grave failures I can detect &mdash; what an unsubdued 
        will &mdash; what lightness and frivolity &mdash; what lack of subjection to the word 
        of God &mdash; what self-satisfaction and complacency! Alas, 'man at his best 
        estate is altogether vanity.'</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. . . [a later experience] 
        showed me . . . that the carnal mind was still a part of my being.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In vain I searched my heart 
        to see if I had made a full surrender, and tried to give up every known 
        thing that seemed in any sense evil or doubtful. Sometimes, for a month 
        at a time, or even longer, I could persuade myself that at last I had 
        indeed again received the blessing. But invariably a few weeks would bring 
        before me once more that which proved that it was in my particular case 
        all a delusion.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I did not dare open my heart 
        to my assistants in the work, or to the 'soldiers' who were under my guidance. 
        To do so I felt would be to lose all influence with them and to be looked 
        upon as a backslider. So, alone and in secret, I fought my battles and 
        never went into a holiness meeting without persuading myself that now 
        at least, I was fully surrendered and therefore must have the blessing 
        of sanctification. Sometimes I called it entire consecration and felt 
        easier. It did not seem to be claiming too much. I had no conception at 
        the time of the hypocrisy of all this.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What made my distress more 
        poignant was the knowledge that I was not the only sufferer. Another, 
        one very dear to me, shared my doubts and anxieties from the same cause. 
        For that other it eventually meant utter shipwreck of faith; and one of 
        the loveliest souls I ever knew was lost in the mazes of spiritualism. 
        God grant it may not be forever, but that mercy may be found of the Lord 
        in that day!</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And now I began to see what 
        a string of derelicts this holiness teaching left in its train. I could 
        count scores of persons who had gone into utter infidelity because of 
        it. They always gave the same reason: 'I tried it all. I found it a failure. 
        So I concluded the Bible teaching was all a delusion, and religion was 
        a mere matter of the emotions.' Many more (and I knew several such intimately) 
        lapsed into insanity after floundering in the morass of this emotional 
        religion for years&mdash;and people said that studying the Bible had driven 
        them crazy. How little they knew that it was lack of Bible knowledge that 
        was accountable for their wretched mental state&mdash;an absolutely unscriptural 
        use of isolated passages of Scripture!</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The language of my troubled 
        soul, after all those years of preaching to others, was, '0 that I knew 
        where I might find Him!' Finding Him not, I saw only the blackness of 
        despair before me; but yet I knew too well His love and care to be completely 
        cast down.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">The Struggle 
        Ended</font></B></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But at last it began to be 
        clear to me that the holiness doctrine had a most baneful influence upon 
        the movement. People who professed conversion (whether real or not the 
        day will declare) struggled for months, even years, to reach a state of 
        sinlessness which never was reached; and at last they gave up in despair 
        and sank back in many instances to the dead level of the world around 
        them.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I saw that it was the same 
        with all the holiness denominations, and the various 'Bands,' 'Missions,' 
        and other movements, that were continually breaking off from them. The 
        standard set was the unattainable. The result was, sooner or later, utter 
        discouragement, cunningly concealed hypocrisy, or an unconscious lowering 
        of the standard to suit the experience reached. For myself I had been 
        ensnared by the last expedient for a long time. How much of the second 
        there was I do not dare to say. But eventually I fell a victim to the 
        first. And I can now see that it was a mercy I did so.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At last I found myself becoming 
        cold and cynical. Doubts as to everything assailed me like a legion of 
        demons, and I became almost afraid to let my mind dwell on these things. 
        For refuge I turned to secular literature, and sent for my books, which 
        some years before I had foresworn on condition that God would give me 
        the 'second blessing.' How little I realized the Jacob-spirit in all this! 
        God seemed to have failed; so I took up my books once more, and tried 
        to find solace in the beauties of essays and poetry, or the problems of 
        history and science. I did not dare to confess to myself that I was literally 
        an agnostic; yet for a month at least I could only answer, 'I do not know' 
        to every question based on divine revelation.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was the legitimate result 
        of the teaching I had been under. I reasoned that the Bible promised entire 
        relief from indwelling sin to all who were wholly surrendered to the will 
        of God. That I had thus surrendered seemed to me certain. Why then had 
        I not been fully delivered from the carnal mind? It seemed to me that 
        I had met every condition, and that God, on His part, had failed to perform 
        what He had promised. I know it is wretched to write all this: but I see 
        no other way to help others who are in the same state that I was in for 
        that awful month.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Deliverance came at last . 
        .</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Little by little, the light 
        began to dawn. We [the author and an acquaintance] saw that we had been 
        looking within for holiness, instead of without. We realized that the 
        same grace that had saved us at first alone could carry us on. Dimly we 
        apprehended that all for us must be in Christ, or we were without a ray 
        of hope.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many questions perplexed and 
        troubled us. Much that we had believed we soon saw to be utterly opposed 
        to the word of God. Much more we could not understand, so completely warped 
        had our minds become through the training of years . . . The great truth 
        was getting a grip of me that holiness, perfect love, sanctification, 
        and every other blessing, were mine in Christ from the moment I had believed, 
        and mine forevermore, because all of pure grace. I had been looking at 
        the wrong man&mdash;all was in another Man, and in that Man for me! But it took 
        weeks to see this.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I have been learning all 
        along my pilgrim journey that the more my heart is taken up with Christ, 
        the more do I enjoy practical deliverance from sin's power, and the more 
        do I realize what it is to have the love of God shed abroad in that heart 
        by the Holy Spirit given to me, as the earnest of the glory to come. I 
        have found liberty and joy since being thus freed from bondage that I 
        never thought it possible for a soul to know on earth, while I have a 
        confidence in presenting this precious truth for the acceptance of others 
        that contrasts with the uncertainty of the past.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. . . I desire . . . to sum 
        up . . . my impressions of the Holiness movement.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="6-7b.gif" alt="Fruits" width=384 height=257 border=0 align="right"></font><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Observations on the Holiness Movement</strong></font>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since turning aside from the perfectionist societies, I have often been asked if I find as high a standard maintained among Christians generally who do not profess to have the 'second blessing' as I have seen among those who do. "My answer is that after carefully, and I trust without prejudice, considering both, I have found a far higher standard maintained by believers who intelligently reject the eradication theory than among those who accept it. Quiet, unassuming Christians, who know their Bibles and their own hearts too well to permit their lips to talk of sinlessness and perfection in the flesh, nevertheless are characterized by intense devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ, love for the word of God, and holiness of life and walk. But these blessed fruits spring, not from self-occupation, but from occupation with Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit.</font>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The great professing body who are scarcely clear or pronounced as to anything, I do not here take into account. I refer rather to those among the various denominations, and those outside of all such companies, who confess Christ boldly and seek to be a testimony for Him in the world. Compared with these, I repeat, a far lower standard of Christian living is found among the so-called holiness people. </font>            
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <P>The reasons are not far to seek; for in the first place the profession 
        of holiness induces a subtle spiritual pride that is often the veriest 
        pharisaism, and frequently leads to the most manifest self-confidence. 
        And secondly, the next thing to saying I live without sin, is to say that 
        nothing that I do is sin. Consequently, the teaching of holiness in the 
        flesh tends to harden the conscience and to cause the one who professes 
        it to lower the standard to his own poor experience. Any who move much 
        among those in this profession will soon begin to realize how greatly 
        prevalent are the conditions I have described. Holiness professors are 
        frequently cutting, censorious, uncharitable and harsh in their judgment 
        of others. Exaggerations, amounting to downright dishonesty, are unconsciously 
        encouraged by and often indulged in their 'testimony' meetings. The rank 
        and file are no freer from vulgarisms, slangy expressions, and levity 
        in conversation than ordinary persons who make no such profession; while 
        many of the preachers are largely given to sensational and amusing sermons 
        that are anything but serious and edifying. And all this, mark you, without 
        sinning!
      <P>The apostle Paul emphasizes 'envy, strife and divisions' as evidences 
        of carnality, and designates them as the works of the flesh. Where have 
        divisions, with all their accompanying evils, been more manifest than 
        among the rival holiness organizations, some of which roundly denounce 
        all connected with the others as 'backsliders,' and 'on the road to hell'? 
        I have heard such denunciations on many occasions . . . I have observed 
        that debt and its twin brother, worry, are as common among such professors 
        as among others. In fact, the sinfulness of worrying rarely seems to be 
        apprehended by them. Holiness advocates have all the little unpleasant 
        ways that are so trying in many of us: they are no more free from penuriousness, 
        tattling, evil-speaking, selfishness, and kindred weaknesses, than their 
        neighbors.
      <P>And as to downright wickedness and uncleanness, I regret to have to 
        record that sins of a positively immoral character are, I fear, far more 
        frequently met with in holiness churches and missions . . . than the outsider 
        would think possible. I know whereof I speak; and only a desire to save 
        others from the bitter disappointments I had to meet leads me to write 
        as I do. Among Christians generally there are failures that shock and 
        wound the sensibilities of many, occurring from time to time, through 
        a lack of watching unto prayer. But surely, among the holiness people, 
        such failures, if they ever occur, do so at very rare intervals! Would 
        that I could say so. Alas, it is far otherwise! The path of the holiness 
        movement . . . is strewn with thousands of such moral and spiritual breakdowns.
      <P>On the other hand, I gladly concede that both in the ranks of the religious-military 
        society of which I was once a member, and in other holiness organizations, 
        there are many, very many, pious, devoted men and women whose zeal for 
        God and self-abnegation are lovely to witness, and will surely be rewarded 
        in 'that day.' But let no one be blinded by this to suppose it is the 
        holiness doctrine that has made them such. The refutation of this is the 
        simple fact that the great majority of martyrs, missionaries and servants 
        of Christ who in all the Christian centuries have 'loved not their lives 
        unto the death,' never dreamed of making such a claim for themselves, 
        but daily owned their sinfulness by nature and constant need of the advocacy 
        of Christ.
      <P>The testimonies of many who were at one time prominent in other organizations 
        where holiness in the flesh is preached and professed fully agree with 
        mine as to the large percentage of 'backslidings' from virtue and personal 
        purity.
      <P>Superstition and fanaticism of the grossest character find a hotbed 
        among 'holiness' advocates. Witness the present disgusting 'Tongues Movement,' 
        with all its attendant delusions and insanities. An unhealthy craving 
        for new and thrilling religious sensations, and emotional meetings of 
        a most exciting character, readily account for these things. Because settled 
        peace is unknown, and final salvation is supposed to depend on progress 
        in the soul, people get to depend so much upon 'blessings,' and 'new baptisms 
        of the Spirit,' as they call these experiences, that they readily fall 
        a prey to the most absurd delusions. In the last few years hundreds of 
        holiness meetings all over the world have been literally turned into pandemoniums 
        where exhibitions worthy of a madhouse or of a collection of howling dervishes 
        are held night after night. No wonder a heavy toll of lunacy and infidelity 
        is the frequent result.
      <P>Now I am well aware that many holiness teachers repudiate all connection 
        with these fanatics; but they do not seem to see that it is their doctrines 
        that are the direct cause of the disgusting fruits I have been enumerating. 
        Let a full Christ be preached, a finished work be proclaimed, the truth 
        of the indwelling Spirit be scripturally taught, and all these excrescences 
        disappear.
      </font> <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps the saddest 
        thing about the movement to which I have referred is the long list of 
        shipwrecks concerning the faith to be attributed to its unsound instruction. 
        Large numbers of persons seek 'holiness' for years only to find they have 
        had the unattainable before them. Others profess to have received it, 
        but are forced at last to own it was all a mistake. The result is sometimes 
        that the mind gives way beneath the strain; but more frequently unbelief 
        in the inspiration of the Scriptures is the logical result. It is for 
        persons dangerously near these shoals of infidelity and darkness that 
        I have penned these papers. God's word remains true. He has not promised 
        what He will not perform. It is you, dear troubled one, who have been 
        misled by faulty teaching as to the true nature of sanctification, and 
        the proper effects of the indwelling Spirit of God. Let neither gloomy 
        unbelief nor melancholy disappointment hinder your . . . searching the 
        Scriptures daily whether these things be so. And may God in His rich grace 
        and mercy give every self-occupied reader to look away to Christ alone, 
        'who, of God, is made unto us wisdom: even righteousness, sanctification, 
        and redemption.'</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font>
