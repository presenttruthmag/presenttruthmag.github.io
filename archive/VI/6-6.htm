Paxton</font>  <p> <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Editorial Note:</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Geoffrey J. Paxton is the principal of the Queensland Bible Institute, which is an interdenominational, evangelical Bible training college in Brisbane, Australia. For a number of years he has specialized in the study of the Reformation issues.</font></p>
<p><font size="5"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Editor:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Mr. Paxton, do you consider that a wrong theology of holiness and sanctification "breeds" Pentecostalism?</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="5">Paxton:</font></b> Yes, I do! The modern Pentecostal movement sprang out of a nineteenth-century American phenomenon known as the holiness movement. Its emphasis on what sanctification is and how it is achieved was a radical departure from Reformation theology.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This pseudo-holiness theology 
              is rampant in the Protestant churches today, especially among good, conservative 
              and earnest Christians. Although they may be opposed to the tongues movement, 
              their theology is basically Pentecostal and they are unwittingly promoting 
        Pentecostalism.</font> </p>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="5">Editor:</font></B> What are the 
        chief characteristics of this false holiness theology?</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="5">Paxton:</font></B> All good theology 
        makes a distinction between justification and sanctification, but a common 
        error is to divorce sanctification from justification. Sanctification 
        is then viewed as a separate act of itself beyond (or above) the blessing 
        of justification. This sort of sanctification may be viewed in the following 
        ways:</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4">(1)</font></strong> Justification is seen as 
        God's work whereas sanctification is seen as our responsibility. Of course, 
        few would articulate it as bluntly as this, but popular books on "victorious 
        living" advocate special "preconditions," "secrets" and "keys" in which 
        we must exercise ourselves if "God's best" is to become ours. This philosophy 
        of activism may also be called Christian pietism.</font>
      <P><strong><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sanctification is seen 
        as completely the work of God. In this approach little or no stress is 
        placed upon the activity of the believer. In fact we are told that such 
        effort can be a hindrance to true sanctity. Here we are told to "Let go 
        and let God." Here the blessed state is "utter yieldedness to Him," "complete 
        abandonment," "allowing Him to live His life through us." This is quietism.</font>
      <P><strong><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sanctification is seen 
        in static categories. The emphasis is placed upon the quantity of faith, 
        love, etc., in the believer. Sanctification is seen in terms of "qualities 
        of being" which the believer possesses. Hence the gaze of the believer 
        is on himself, inward and not outward, downward and not upward, self-centered 
        and not Christ-centered. Hence we may call this emphasis "internalism" 
        in contrast to "external ism." One only has to examine many of the popular 
        hymn books to see this believer-oriented mentality.</font>
      <P><strong><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(4) </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not surprising, then, 
        in the light of these things, that much popular teaching on sanctification 
        is implicitly (if not outright explicitly) perfectionistic. People are 
        told that the higher life of sanctification is obtainable if only they 
        measure up to two perfectionistic conditions: absolute surrender, and 
        freedom from all known sin.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Absolute Surrender:</b> 
        Jesus in Gethsemane and on the cross exhibited the only absolute surrender 
        ever seen in this world. In the light of His absolute surrender and our 
        own radical sinfulness of nature, we must flee from any confidence in 
        even our acts of consecration and hide ourselves in the absolute surrender 
        of our Substitute. The way of "holiness" teaching is to get the blessing 
        based on our "absolute surrender" (which is an impossibility). The way 
        of the gospel is to receive God's benefits based on Christ's absolute 
        surrender on our behalf. The former is to advocate perfectionism. The 
        latter is the Bible truth of righteousness by faith.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Freedom from All Known Sin:</b> 
        Certainly a son of God does not set himself to practice evil (I John 3:9), 
        but who could say he is free from all known sin (unless he is utterly 
        blind to the spirituality of the law and the radical fault of his nature)? 
        The universal testimony of the prophets and apostles is that they knew 
        they fell short of God's glory and they were conscious of imperfection 
        in their best endeavors and holiest duties. The man who went down from 
        the Temple acceptable to God was not the one who could find nothing amiss 
        but the one who said, "God be merciful to me a sinner."</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="5">Editor:</font></B> In what respects 
        does such teaching differ from the Reformation understanding?</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="5">Paxton:</font></B> The Reformers 
        did not separate sanctification from justification in such a way as to 
        make them unrelated and quite apart from each other. The idea of justification 
        as the work of God and sanctification as the work of man finds no support 
        in Reformation teaching. Professor Berkouwer reproduces the emphasis of 
        the Reformers when he says, "We may never speak of sanctification as if 
        we are entering &mdash; having gone through the gate of justification &mdash; upon 
        a new, independent field of operation . . . "&mdash;G. C. Berkouwer, <em>Faith 
        and Sanctification</em>, p.42. In contrast to the pietism, quietism, internalism 
        and perfectionism of "holiness" teachers, we may say:</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(1) </strong>The Reformers were not 
        pietistic. They did not stress the action of the Christian to the diminution 
        of the grace of God. Faith was stressed in relation to sanctification 
        as well as to justification. The initiative of the sovereign God was not 
        lost sight of amid the constant exhortations to godliness. The imperative 
        "ought" was not used to diminish the great indicative "is" of redemptive 
        mercy and grace. Faith in God alone is the sponsor of good works as far 
        as Luther was concerned.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(2) </strong>While the Reformers did 
        not so play up the action of the believer as to play down the gracious 
        initiative of God, neither did they stress the initiative of divine grace 
        so as to exclude the response of the believer. The Reformers were not 
        quietistic. According to Luther, faith precedes good works, and works 
        follow faith. The Reformers did not teach faith which is removed from 
        the concrete realities of daily existence. Rather, saving faith sponsors 
        a life of devout acts. Both Luther and Calvin stressed the necessity for 
        the believer to "work out" his salvation as well as stressing "For it 
        is God which worketh . . . " (Phil. 2:12, 13). In so far as they stressed 
        "For it is God which worketh . . . ," they excluded pietism; and in stressing 
        "work out your own salvation," they excluded quietism.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(3) </strong>The Reformers were not 
        internalistic in their thinking. To say this is not to say that either 
        Luther or Calvin denied any internal work. However, the Reformers stressed 
        the objective realities of salvation, the righteousness of Christ and 
        the promise of God. Certainly the gaze of the believer was to be constantly 
        fixed on the sovereign God, who has revealed Himself finally in the Word. 
        In fact, this is the very nature of saving faith; it focuses itself upon 
        God and His mercy.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(4) </strong>The Reformers did not tolerate 
        perfectionism in any form this side of heaven. Perfectionism is the premature 
        seizure of the glory that will be. Often in the churches, one hears of 
        the defeat depicted (supposedly) in Romans 7 and the need for the victory 
        revealed in Romans 8. This approach is highly suspect from two points: 
        it has grave exegetical difficulties, and it fails to perceive precisely 
        what Romans 8 is really saying.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The believer of Romans 8 is 
        one who is called to suffer here and now (vs. 1 7, 18) and to realize 
        that there is glory still to be revealed (v. 18). Such a believer is said 
        to groan and travail. He has the first fruits of the Spirit (v.23). Rather 
        than having the "all" here and now, the believer is waiting (v.23) because 
        he is saved only in hope (v.24). Whereas today we are being told of the 
        demonstration of fullness of an experience in the Spirit, Paul tells us 
        that we do not see such fullness at all (v.24). In fact, our hope is the 
        basis of our endurance (vs. 24, 25). To teach fullness of an experience 
        in the Spirit here is to rob the believer of his hope. Could the emphasis 
        upon the "here and now" be responsible for the great lack of interest 
        in the Lord's return and the great "there and then"?</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="5">Editor:</font></B> Are you against 
        holiness?</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="5">Paxton:</font></B> Certainly not. 
        I am against false views of holiness which, in actual fact, inhibit if 
        not prohibit true holiness. Holiness is being concerned about God's holiness, 
        not our own. Of course, once we are concerned about God's holiness and 
        once our attention is focused on such, we will image God, we will highlight 
        what He eternally is by the way we live.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Holiness" which is seen as 
        something the believer achieves by dint of effort, or even by refusing 
        to have anything to do with effort (!), is not the holiness of which the 
        Bible speaks. Such "holiness,"with which a great many Christians are concerned, 
        reflects an egoistic desire to "be something" or (and this I think is 
        more often the case) to go through life untroubled and unscathed by its 
        pressures and complexities! Hence self-interest and introspection often 
        characterize such holiness-seekers. Merit-mentality is never far away 
        either.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="5">Editor:</font></B> How does the 
        common view of "holiness" inhibit real holiness?</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="5">Paxton: </font></B><font color="#000000">Because: </font><font color="8000"><strong>&nbsp; </strong></font></font>      
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="8000"><strong>Firstly,</strong></font> it 
          inhibits real holiness in so far as it provides a substitute for the real 
      thing. And such substitutes are not good enough. </font>      
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="80000"><strong>Secondly, </strong></font>the common 
            emphasis upon holiness concentrates very heavily upon the faith of the 
            believer. We are constantly being urged to believe more, to have stronger 
            faith, to be more yeilded, etc. This emphasis is most probably based upon 
            the presupposition that faith is the product of human subjectivity. Now, 
            in actuality, faith is not a product of human subjectivity. The way not 
            to increase faith is to focus on faith. Faith is deepened by the highlighting 
            of the great Object of faith &mdash; His person and work. Faith not only takes 
            its value from its Object, but it is deepened by greater involvement with 
            its Object, not itself. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="80000">Thirdly,</font></strong> the dominant approach 
        to "holiness" wishes to eradicate the tension between the "already" and 
        the "not yet" of the Biblical perspective.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have often heard it said 
        that only unbelief on the believer's part stops him from enjoying God's 
        "all." "All that God has to give us is available only if ... " is a common 
        assertion. Such teaching is a flagrant contradiction of the New Testament. 
        This is no more clearly demonstrated than in the way Paul designates the 
        Holy Spirit.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul designates the Spirit 
        as first fruits (aparche) in Romans 8:23. Such emphasizes the beginning-character 
        of the gift of the Spirit and focuses attention also (that is, in addition 
        to, or alongside of, the present reality of the Spirit) on the expectation 
        of the final, full harvest. Paul also refers to the Spirit as a pledge 
        (arrabon) in Ephesians 1:14, etc. Referring to the Spirit as a pledge 
        refers to the veracity of the promise of ultimate fulness and the validity 
        of the Christian's expectation.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hence, to speak of the Spirit 
        in terms which obscure the "not yet" dimension is to distort the perspective 
        of the New Testament. The way the "not yet" is obscured is by an unwarranted 
        overemphasis upon the "already," the present gift of the Spirit, which 
        is a glorious reality.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is nothing which will 
        disturb the true Biblical teaching upon holiness more than giving this 
        penultimate age ultimate significance. We are not permitted to bring the 
        ultimate "then" into the penultimate "now." This age is seen properly 
        when it is seen in the light of the end, not when it is viewed as the 
        end. In my opinion, this is one of the most urgently-needed emphases in 
        the churches today.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="80000">Finally,</font></strong> real holiness is inhibited 
        because of a failure to handle the Word of God correctly. Substitutes, 
        faith-centered ness and false perspectives are only possible so long as 
        we continue to refuse a proper approach to the Bible. Faulty handling 
        of the Word must result in sub-Christian living. In many respects, there 
        is no attention paid to laws of interpretation and the need of careful 
        and informed exegesis. Chaos has and will continue to result while these 
        tragic matters continue.</font>
