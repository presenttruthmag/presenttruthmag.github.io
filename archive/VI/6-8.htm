      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Christian message surrounds two great events: the first and second 
            comings of Jesus Christ. As there are two distinct advents, so there are 
            two distinct kingdoms brought to view in the gospel: the kingdom of grace 
            and the kingdom of glory.      </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <P>When Christ began preaching, "The kingdom of God is at hand" (Mark 1:1 
        5), He was not referring to the future immortal kingdom. He was referring 
        to the kingdom of grace, which was to be established by His own bitter 
        suffering and death, although it had existed by purpose from eternity, 
        and by promise since the fall of man (Rom. 16:25, R.S.V.; Gen. 3:15).
      <P>Says the writer to the Hebrews, "Let us therefore come boldly unto the 
        throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace . . . Heb. 4:16. 
        The throne of grace represents the kingdom of grace, for the existence 
        of a throne implies the existence of a kingdom. When Christ returned to 
        heaven, we are told that He sat down on the throne (Heb. 1:3; 8:1, 2). 
        He did not sit down on the throne of glory; He sat down on His throne 
        of grace-His priestly throne of mediatorial office. Says the prophet, 
        " . . . He. . . shall sit and rule upon His throne; and He shall be a 
        priest upon His throne.. . ". Zech 6:13.
      <P>The kingdom of glory still exists by promise; it will not be set up until 
        the second advent of Christ. Says the Lord Himself, "When the Son of man 
        shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall 
        He sit upon the throne of His glory: and before Him shall be gathered 
        all nations . .Matt. 25:31, 32.
      <P><B><font size="4">Confusing the Two Kingdoms</font></B>
      <P>At the time of Christ's first advent, the Jewish people were looking 
        for a Messiah to sit on David's throne. When they heard John the Baptist 
        proclaim, "The kingdom of heaven is at hand," they were filled with visions 
        of the glory of a literal kingdom. Even John the Baptist and Jesus' disciples 
        had no true idea of the purpose of Christ's first advent or the nature 
        of the kingdom He was about to set up. They could not at first clearly 
        distinguish between the kingdom of grace and the kingdom of glory.
      <P>The same confusion still exists in the minds of many who profess the 
        Christian faith. When people say that Christ's second coming is His coming 
        into the hearts of His people, they are utterly confounding the kingdom 
        of grace and the kingdom of glory. When believers start looking for complete 
        spiritual fulfillment or a second blessing of empirical perfection here 
        and now, they are trying to bring some elements of the kingdom of glory 
        over into the kingdom of grace&mdash;the "not yet" into the "now."
      <P><B><font size="4">The Kingdom of Grace</font></B>
      <P>A kingdom is usually established by warfare and conquest. The kingdom 
        of grace is no exception. It has been established by Christ's conflict 
        with, and conquest of, the kingdom of death and the devil. " . . . having 
        drawn the sting of all the powers ranged against us, He exposed them, 
        shattered, empty and defeated, in His final glorious triumphant act!" 
        Col. 2:15, Phillips. "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of 
        flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that 
        through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, 
        the devil . . ." Heb. 2:14.
      <P>Who enter the kingdom of grace? Sinners &mdash; sinners of all sorts! For grace 
        means favor or mercy to those who are sinful, lost and undeserving. The 
        holy angels do not need or receive grace, and it is not their privilege 
        to enter this kingdom. This kingdom is for the lame, the halt and the 
        blind.
      <P>From His throne of grace, Christ pleads before Justice that sinners might 
        be admitted into this kingdom. In themselves they have no right to enter. 
        They deserve only death and destruction. But Christ makes intercession 
        for the transgressors (Isa. 53:12). He has made satisfaction for their 
        sin and satisfied Justice on their behalf. Between God and the sinner, 
        nothing remains but mercy &mdash; infinite mercy. Grace means to be accepted 
        in spite of being unacceptable. It is to be fully known and fully forgiven. 
        Those who try to make themselves worthy or more qualified to enter do 
        in fact dig ditches before the door of the kingdom which they can never 
        get across.
      <P>Yet we must not get the idea that grace will tow a man to heaven against 
        his consent. None enter but those who believe. Not that faith is self-generated 
        by the sinner (for grace, and grace only, inspires and creates faith), 
        but faith is the sinner saying "Yes" to God's invitation to enter the 
        fold of justification and acceptance.
      <P>If only sinners may enter the kingdom of grace, who, then, inhabit this 
        kingdom? And the answer is sinners! If they were not sinners, it would 
        not be a kingdom of grace. Those within the kingdom eat, drink and breathe 
        grace. And grace is only for sinners. Says the apostle Paul," ... for 
        all have sinned, and continue to come' short of the glory of God. . . 
        " Rom. 3:23. Here we have a definition of sin. It is to fall short of 
        the glory of God. (And in the Hebrew and Greek languages, the word for 
        sin generally means to fall short or to miss the mark.) Not only have 
        all fallen short of the glory of God, but all continue to fall short of 
        the glory of God. Therefore all the saints on earth are still sinners 
        and will remain sinners in themselves as long as they fall short of the 
      glory of God. And just so long do they need grace.      
      </font>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Therefore being 
          justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 
          by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, 
          and rejoice in hope of the glory of God." Rom. 5:1,2.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <P>The justified (that is, those within the kingdom of grace) rejoice in 
        hope of the glory of God. They wait, groan and long for their full restoration 
        as sons of God. With Paul they say:
      <ul>
        <font size="2">". . . and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs 
        with Christ; if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified 
        together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not 
        worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us . . 
        . For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain 
        together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have 
        the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, 
        waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. For we are 
        saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, 
        why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do 
        we with patience wait for it." Rom. 8:17, 18,22-25. </font> 
      </ul>
      <P>Now these facts plainly appear: God's people will be glorified together 
        when their bodies are changed at the second coming of Christ. They have 
        not yet attained to this glory, but they patiently wait for it in hope. 
        Meanwhile they fall short of the glory of God, and. in this they are still 
        sinners and confess themselves to be sinners&mdash;otherwise they are liars 
        (1 John 1:8). And as long as they wait for this glory to be revealed in 
        them, they need grace. Grace must reign till glory, even as Paul declares, 
        " . . . even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life 
        by Jesus Christ our Lord." Rom. 5:21.
      <P>Grace is free (although not cheap); yet it is hard for the proud heart 
        of man to humbly accept the gift that contains the expensive outlay of 
        heaven's treasure. And if sinners can be brought to see their need of 
        grace, there is still within them a tendency to want to dispense with 
        it as soon as possible. They want to "pay their own way." As Luther warns 
        in his commentary on Romans, they are sometimes in too great a haste to 
        become pure and sinless saints. The Reformer likened the situation of 
        the rescued sinner to the man who was rescued by the good Samaritan. The 
        good Samaritan, Christ, pours wine and oil into the wounds of the sinner 
        and takes him to the inn for further cure. He asks the innkeeper to take 
        care of the man, with a promise to repay the keeper's efforts upon his 
        return. The sick man has begun to recover, but nothing would harm him 
        so much as to imagine that he is entirely well. So, as Luther said, the 
        church is an inn or an infirmary for the sick or the convalescing. It 
        is the fold of grace, wherein the inmates are the objects of Christ's 
        special solicitude and care. As long as they keep counting themselves 
        as sinners and imploring God's mercy, God keeps counting that they are 
        righteous. When the fanatical spirits in Germany tried to get above the 
        truth of justification by faith, Luther exclaimed: "May God in His mercy 
        preserve me from a church in which there are none but saints. I wish to 
        be in fellowship with the humble, the feeble, the sick, who know and feel 
        their sins, and who sigh and cry continually to God from the bottom of 
        their hearts to obtain His consolation and support."
      <P>The truth of being continually justified by grace (Rom. 3:24 [note the 
        present continuous tense] is for the comfort and consolation of the saints. 
        It is not a soft pillow for hypocrites to put their heads on, nor an invitation 
        to the presumptuous to carouse on the mercy of God. In case some antinomian 
        spirit may pervert the truth into encouragement to sin with an easy conscience, 
        we also say this: He who thinks he can continue to trample on God's law 
        that grace may abound (Rom. 6:1; 1 John 3:9) is a thief and robber who 
        tries to get into the fold of grace by a way other than the door (John 
        10:1). Those who live by grace know what it has cost God and Christ to 
        get it for them. They delight in God's law after the inward man, and they 
        mourn only because they fall so far short of its requirements (Rom. 7:22-25). 
        They would rather die than commit a known sin; yet they know that their 
        best acts are unworthy before God.
      <P>The law of God has not been set aside by the death of Jesus, but only 
        its penalty and condemnation to those in the kingdom of grace. It still 
        has its function to magnify sin to the believer so that he will ever be 
        conscious that grace must continue to "much more abound" (Rom. 5:20).
      <P><B><font size="4">The Kingdom of Glory</font></B>
      <P> While sinners enter the kingdom of grace, only sinless beings can enter 
        the kingdom of glory. Says the apostle, "Now this I say, brethren, that 
        flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption 
        inherit incorruption." 1 Cor. 15:50. 
      <ul>
        <font size="2">"Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, 
        but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, 
        at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be 
        raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must 
        put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when 
        this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall 
        have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that 
        is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 0 death, where is thy sting? 
        0 grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength 
        of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through 
        our Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Cor. 15:51-57. </font> 
      </ul>
      </font> <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Little is said in the 
        Bible about this future, immortal state. " . . . it doth not yet appear 
        what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be 
        like Him . . . " 1 John 3:2. As Luther has said, we know as little about 
        the next life as a baby in the womb knows about the life he is about to 
        enter. But every believer knows this: In the gift of the Holy Spirit, 
        God has given him a foretaste, the first fruits, the down payment of the 
        powers of the world to come (Heb. 6:4, 5; Rom. 8:23; Eph. 1:14). He knows 
        that life is not, and cannot be, fulfilled within the historical process. 
        Just as a great change&mdash;the new birth&mdash;took place when he entered the kingdom 
        of grace, so another great change must take place before he enters the 
        kingdom of glory. This final change takes place at the resurrection, at 
        the coming of Christ. This is the only genuine and valid second blessing 
        taught in the New Testament. The truth of justification by faith (the 
        kingdom of grace) gives meaning and hope to the doctrine of the second 
        coming of Jesus (the kingdom of glory).<BR>
