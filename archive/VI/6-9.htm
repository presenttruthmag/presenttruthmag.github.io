</blockquote><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The practice of so-called "unknown 
          tongues" is not only on the increase in Christendom, but it has been moving 
          up from the circles of the one-time unsophisticated Pentecostals into Lutheran, 
          Episcopalian, Catholic and other circles. The twentieth-century movement 
          is infiltrating everywhere and bringing with it confusion, doubt, strife 
          and discord. Much of Christendom sits by, at a loss as to what to do about 
          the movement, hoping with Gamaliel (Acts 5:38, 39) that it is not of God 
          and that it will therefore fail. That, in my estimation, is not the solution. 
          What is needed is a diligent effort to inform Christians on the matter so 
          that they will be able to meet it with knowledge and understanding.</font>
</p>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More than thirty years ago, while 
        I was still a student in the seminary, I was spending a holiday in Chicago. 
        Finding myself bored one evening, I went for a walk, looking for excitement. 
        I found it less than two blocks from where I was staying&mdash;in a former Jewish 
        synagogue being used by a group of Pentecostals. A service was in progress, 
        and curiosity drew me in. The fairly large auditorium held a scattering 
        of people. On the stage sat the clergyman. I took my position as an observer 
        in the balcony. There was no order to the service. The preacher would 
        preach or pray in a monotonous, high-pitched tone of voice. Someone would 
        start singing a catchy gospel hymn and be joined by the rest of the congregation. 
        There were clapping of hands and stamping of feet. Noisy periods were 
        interspersed with long moments of absolute silence. I had sat through 
        perhaps thirty minutes of this when, out of a period of silence, a woman 
        rose and began to speak with unintelligible sounds. That was my introduction 
        to the gift of tongues. Though I was only a very young man at the time, 
        it was apparent to me that the entire service had been geared to overwhelm 
        the emotions and that what I had witnessed was not a gift of the Spirit 
        of God but emotional intoxication or hysteria.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John L. Sherrill, in his book, 
        <em>They Speak With Other Tongues</em>, reports his investigation of the 
        tongues movement. As a newspaper writer, he conducted a very thorough 
        and seemingly unbiased investigation of the movement. He describes his 
        first experience with a Pentecostal service, and, except for the fact 
        that his experience took place in New York, I could have been persuaded 
        that he had attended the same service that I had. Later experience with 
        Pentecostals and other revivalistic groups, however, has satisfied me 
        that they all use the same techniques, playing on the emotions until the 
        emotionally weak or responsive give way to manifestations of emotional 
        intoxication or hysteria. I do not mean to be disrespectful of Christian 
        womanhood or of womanhood in general when I say that evidence of this 
        is to be found also in the fact that women take a leading role in this 
        movement and are more readily responsive to the technique than men. Women 
        are simply more inclined to be emotional than are men.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The twentieth-century tongues 
        movement had its start at the very beginning of the century when, in the 
        year 1900, a young Methodist minister, Charles F. Parham, felt that there 
        was something wrong with his spiritual life and set out to find a solution 
        to his spiritual problem. He gathered together a commune of some forty 
        "Bible students" &mdash; men, women and children &mdash; in an abandoned mansion in 
        Topeka, Kansas. He knew the direction that their studies would have to 
        take, and eventually the group came to the conclusion that they needed 
        the "baptism of the Holy Spirit" manifested in the gift of tongues. On 
        New Year's Eve, 1900, the group met together and prayed from dawn to dark 
        for the gift of tongues, but in vain. Finally a young woman recalled that 
        in the book of Acts, in two instances (Sherrill says "often"), the gift 
        of tongues followed the laying on of hands. According to Sherrill, she 
        asked Parham to lay his hands on her while praying for the gift, and while 
        he did so she immediately began to speak in an unknown tongue.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In every instance that Sherrill 
        reports in detail of people receiving the gift, there are details that 
        are common to them all: (1) the person is dissatisfied with his spiritual 
        life; (2) his quest for spiritual satisfaction leads him to the book of 
        Acts; (3) he becomes convinced that the solution to his problem is the 
        baptism of the Spirit manifested in the gift of tongues; (4) he prays 
        for hours on end for the gift; (5) he speaks in ecstatic utterances unintelligible 
        even to himself. Much more can be said about this, but let us simply note 
        the common denominators in other terms: the gift seems more readily available 
        to those who are spiritually disturbed, emotionally troubled, physically 
        and emotionally exhausted, especially responsive to suggestion, auto-suggestion 
        or self-hypnosis. Let us note also that invariably they themselves diagnose 
        their own spiritual illness, prescribe what is needed for their cure, 
        and storm the throne of God with prayer until He gives in and gives them 
        what they insist they must have.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does the Holy Spirit really 
        give these people the ability to speak in unknown tongues? We cannot deny 
        that the Spirit gave that gift to the disciples on the first Christian 
        Pentecost, causing them to speak in tongues unknown to themselves but 
        intelligible to the foreigners gathered in the city of Jerusalem. We cannot 
        deny that it is possible for the Spirit to give that same gift today. 
        But I have neither read nor heard of any convincing proof that the Spirit 
        does today give the gift of tongues. Oh yes, I have heard and read many 
        strange stories of people relating their own experiences, or of people 
        relating second hand the experiences that others claimed to have had. 
        John Sherri II, for example, relates the case of a man who received the 
        gift, rushed out into the street and spoke in an unknown tongue to a stranger. 
        The stranger responded in an unknown tongue&mdash;unknown to the man with the 
        gift&mdash;and eventually asked the tongues-speaker how he could speak such 
        perfect Polish if he himself could not understand it. And another story 
        is told of a man who receives the gift, speaks to a girl in a park in 
        the unknown tongue, and is informed that he is speaking archaic Arabic. 
        But invariably the two or three witnesses, by whose testimony the truth 
        of the stories might be established, are not available; the identity of 
        the Polish man or the girl in the park are not made known. Sherrill's 
        efforts to have taped tongues-speaking played back to language scholars 
        revealed no known language on many hours of tape.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">The Original 
        Pentecost</font></B></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The one incident of tongues-speaking 
        in the Scriptures which is documented in detail is that of the disciples 
        on the first Christian Pentecost. They testified of Jesus Christ our Savior 
        in known languages so that foreign-language people in the city might know 
        the wonderful works of God in Jesus for the world's salvation. Today the 
        gift of tongues is not spoken of as a means of communicating the gospel 
        to those who cannot understand our own language, but as a special gift 
        of God to give the speaker spiritual and emotional assurance that he has 
        received the gift of the Spirit&mdash;a purely subjective, emotional experience. 
        The Pentecostals, at least in their early history, insisted that the gift 
        of tongues, when used publicly, be matched with the gift of interpretation&mdash;that 
        someone receive the special gift of being able to interpret that which 
        was said in the unknown tongue. Sherrill notes that this happens in his 
        investigations, but at the same time he notes that there is no relation 
        between the amount of speaking that is done by the speaker and the amount 
        of speaking done by the interpreter in the interpretation. He also notes, 
        incidentally, that the interpretation is invariably couched in the words 
        and phraseology of the King James Version of the Bible.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tongues-speakers point 
        out that the gift of tongues is often, frequently spoken of in the Bible, 
        especially in the book of Acts. As far as the book of Acts is concerned, 
        it is not mentioned often. In addition to the story of the first Christian 
        Pentecost, it is specifically mentioned twice: (1) In the story of the 
        conversion of Cornelius and his family at Caesarea, we are told that the 
        gift of the Spirit had been poured out upon the household of Cornelius; 
        and those who had come with Peter were amazed, for, according to Acts 
        10:46, " . . . they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God." 
        (2) When Paul came to Ephesus, he found disciples who knew nothing of 
        the Holy Spirit, having been baptized only in John's baptism. Paul told 
        them of Jesus, and then we are told in Acts 19:5, 6: "On hearing this, 
        they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid 
        his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with 
        tongues and prophesied." We note in both of these passages the implication 
        that the tongues spoken were not ecstatic utterances but, as on the first 
        Christian Pentecost, were known languages; for we are told that those 
        who spoke in the one instance glorified God, and in the other instance 
        "prophesied."</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">The Corinthian 
        Problem</font></B></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For light on the tongues movement, 
        we must turn to the most detailed statement in the Bible on the subject: 
        1 Corinthians 12, 13 and 14. This section is much quoted by the Pentecostals 
        in support of the movement; yet, oddly enough, it was not written in support 
        of the gift of tongues but, rather, to put the gift of tongues, as then 
        employed, in the proper place and perspective. Paul was writing to a troubled 
        congregation, answering a letter in which questions had been asked about 
        some of their problems, among which was this on the gift of tongues. Quite 
        apparently, then as today, the gift of tongues had become a very divisive 
        element in the Corinthian church. Those who had it not only felt, but 
        also gave indication that they thought themselves superior to those who 
        did not have the gift. Then, as today, there was strife, dissension and 
        apparent lovelessness in dealing with the problem&mdash;lovelessness on both 
        sides, but especially disturbing as it was revealed by those who supposedly 
        had received the Holy Spirit into their hearts and lives. It is in introducing 
        this answer to a specific question on the subject that Paul writes, "Now 
        concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be uninformed." 
        And now let us just touch the highlights of the section.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who has received the Holy Spirit? 
        Paul says, ". . . no one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy Spirit" 
        (12:3). In other words, everyone who believes on Jesus as Lord and Savior 
        can be sure that he has been baptized with the Spirit. He does not need 
        some special manifestation of the Spirit's presence in his life. This 
        is one of the sad things of the Pentecostal movement. It not only promotes 
        a Christian community divided into two classes (those who have the gift 
        and those who do not), but it also raises doubts in the minds of many 
        of those who do not have the gift as to whether they are truly Christian.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul then points out that there 
        is a variety of the gifts of the Spirit, all given by the same Spirit 
        (12:4-11) and given for the common good (12:7). He enumerates these gifts 
        of the Spirit as (1) the utterance of wisdom, (2) the utterance of knowledge, 
        (3) faith, (4) gifts of healing, (5) the working of miracles, (6) prophecy, 
        (7) the ability to distinguish between spirits, (8) tongues and (9) the 
        interpretation of tongues. Note that of the nine gifts, tongues and related 
        interpretation are listed last and least of all. I cannot believe that 
        this is an accidental listing on Paul's part, for later in the chapter 
        (12:28-30) Paul gives the list in another way: ". . . God has appointed 
        in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers 
        of miracles, then healers, helpers, administrators, speakers in various 
        kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? 
        Do all work miracles? Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with 
        tongues? Do all interpret?" In short, I sense that Paul tactfully tries 
        to minimize the gift of tongues among all the gifts that the Spirit gives. 
        He condemns, as it were, by the use of faint praise.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the next section of 1 Corinthians 
        12, Paul uses his illustration of the church as the body of Christ, in 
        which each member, with the particular gifts given by the Spirit, contributes 
        to the well-being of the whole body. Usually treated out of context merely 
        as a description of the members of the church working together in Christ, 
        in context this reveals something of the problem that the Corinthians 
        were experiencing and the problem experienced in modern congregations 
        when the tongues movement has entered in. In summary of the section, Paul 
        says, in effect, that it is the purpose of the eye to see, the ear to 
        hear, the tongue to speak, etc. If all members of the body were to have 
        the same function, then the body itself could not function. The eye cannot 
        therefore despise the foot because it cannot see, nor dare the tongue 
        lord it over the nose because it cannot speak. God wisely made the body, 
        Paul says, "that there may be no discord in the body, but that the members 
        may have the same care for one another" (12:25). Yet we find in the tongues 
        movement a tendency on the part of the Pentecostal element to look down 
        upon those who do not have the gift as incomplete Christians, to think 
        themselves superior to all others and their gift the most important gift 
        in the body of Christ. This attitude, perhaps more than anything else 
        in the tongues movement, accounts for the emotional opposition to, and 
        rejection of, the movement by those who do not have the gift. Paul does 
        not have that high regard for the gift of tongues. After enumerating the 
        gifts of the Spirit for the second time, with the gift of tongues at the 
        end of the list, he concludes the chapter: "But earnestly desire the higher 
        gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way" (12:31).</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With that, Paul embarks on 
        his wonderful chapter on love&mdash;love so apparently lacking in the situation 
        in Corinth&mdash;one of the three greatest of God's gifts (faith, hope and love), 
        and the greatest of the three. Here we must comment that we cannot but 
        pray that all Christians might be disturbed about their spiritual condition 
        and seek improvement of the same. Here we cannot help but comment that 
        the cure can be known&mdash;and it is not the gift of tongues, but it is love. 
        Here we cannot help but comment: let not the spiritually disturbed prescribe 
        to God the gift of tongues as the cure, but seek from God the increase 
        of love for God and for fellow man by the indwelling power of the Spirit 
        of God.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="4">Edifying 
        the Church</font></B></font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is in 1 Corinthians 14 that 
        Paul makes his most telling statements on the subject of the gift of tongues. 
        "Make love your aim, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially 
        that you may prophesy" (v. 1)&mdash;not that you may have the gift of tongues 
        but that you may prophesy&mdash;that you may have the ability to teach, exhort, 
        admonish, comfort and build up one another in your Christian faith and 
        love. "For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for 
        no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. On the 
        other hand, he who prophesies speaks to men for their upbuilding and encouragement 
        and consolation. He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who 
        prophesies edifies the church. Now I want you all to speak in tongues, 
        but even more to prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks 
        in tongues, unless some one interprets, so that the church may be edified" 
        (vs. 2-5). The Pentecostals here find encouragement for speaking in tongues 
        but ignore the fact that Paul calls the gift of prophecy greater. I here 
        find the apostle Paul speaking, as we say, with tongue in cheek, minimizing 
        a practice in the Corinthian congregation that is not common to the Christian 
        church but which has been taken over in Corinth from the mystery religions 
        of the Hellenists.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What does the gift of tongues 
        contribute to the kingdom of Christ? Those who have the gift will tell 
        you how wonderful it makes them feel, how it has increased the dimensions 
        of their spiritual life. It does give them evangelistic zeal&mdash;to propagate 
        their Pentecostal form of religion. It does lead them to search the Scriptures&mdash;to 
        filter the Scriptures through their bias to find what they can interpret 
        to support their pursuit of the gift of tongues. Evangelistic zeal and 
        love for Bible study, properly directed and employed, is something we 
        could wish to see more of among all Christians. Then they would be less 
        prone to be swept up by every passing error and religious fad such as 
        the tongues movement.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What does speaking in tongues 
        contribute to the church? Paul says: "Now, brethren, if I come to you 
        speaking in tongues, how shall I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation 
        or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? If even lifeless instruments, such 
        as the flute or harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know 
        what is played? And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get 
        ready for battle? So with yourselves; if you in a tongue utter speech 
        that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will 
        be speaking into the air. There are doubtless many different languages 
        in the world, and none is without meaning; but if I do not know the meaning 
        of the language, I shall be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker 
        a foreigner to me. So with yourselves; since you are eager for manifestations 
        of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church" (vs. 6-12). 
        Further comment is hardly necessary except to note that Paul states that 
        our goal in all that we do in the body of Christ, the church, should be 
        directed toward building up the church&mdash;to win those who have not yet received 
        the gospel, to build up the faith, knowledge, love and life of those who 
        have been brought into the fellowship of the church through the power 
        of the Spirit in the preaching of the gospel.</font>

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next section of 1 Corinthians 
        14 contains words much quoted by the Pentecostals. Paul says, "I thank 
        God that I speak in tongues more than you all . . . " (v. 18). See, Paul 
        speaks in tongues! But Paul does not say that he speaks in ecstatic utterances 
        as do the Pentecostals. As an educated and well-traveled man, I have no 
        doubt that Paul could say this literally, referring to known languages 
        of the world in which he was conversant. But let us concede that he might 
        have spoken in tongues in the Pentecostal sense. Then hear the words in 
        the context in which they have been written: "Therefore, he who speaks 
        in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret. For if I pray in a 
        tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. What am I to do? I 
        will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing 
        with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also. Otherwise, if you 
        bless with the spirit, how can any one in the position of an outsider 
        say the 'Amen' to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are 
        saying? For you may give thanks well enough, but the other man is not 
        edified. I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all; nevertheless, 
        in church I would rather speak five words with my mind, in order to instruct 
        others, than ten thousand words in a tongue" (vs. 13-19).</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Pentecostals feel that 
        they have attained spiritual maturity when they have gained the gift of 
        tongues. This makes them superior to the spiritual babes who have not 
        yet received the gift. How does Paul rate the gift with regard to spiritual 
        maturity? He continues, "Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; 
        be babes in evil, but in thinking be mature" (v.20). That is a reprimand! 
        He is telling the Corinthian tongues-speakers: You are being childish! 
        Grow up! He had implied the same thing in 1 Corinthians 13:11:</font>
      <ul>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"When I was a child, I spoke 
        like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I 
        became a man, I gave up childish ways."</font>
      </ul>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul continues in explaining 
        why the gift of tongues was given in the early church as on the first 
        Christian Pentecost: "In the law it is written, 'By men of strange tongues 
        and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then 
        they will not listen to Me, says the Lord.' Thus tongues are a sign not 
        for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is not for unbelievers 
        but for believers. If, therefore, the whole church assembles and all speak 
        in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that 
        you are mad? But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, 
        he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all, the secrets of 
        his heart are disclosed; and so, falling on his face, he will worship 
        God and declare that God is really among you" (14:21-25). The tongues-speakers 
        use the prophecy of Isaiah 28:11 as a prophecy of tongues-speaking, but 
        Paul does not quote the prophecy as a prophecy of speaking in tongues&mdash;which 
        it is not. H is emphasis is on the thought that all the speaking in unintelligible 
        words will convert no one: " ' . . .even then they will not listen to 
        Me. . . ' "As originally recorded, the words are nothing but a pronouncement 
        of judgment upon Israel. Israel would not listen to the prophets sent 
        by God. He would bring foreign invaders and oppressors upon her. But not 
        even these speakers of foreign languages would persuade Israel to listen 
        to the precepts of God.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the first Christian Pentecost, 
        speaking in tongues unknown to the speakers did convert 3,000 to faith 
        in the Lord Jesus. But the tongues spoken were known to the foreigners 
        gathered in Jerusalem, and the converting power was not in the fact that 
        the disciples spoke in tongues unknown to themselves, but in the fact 
        that they proclaimed the wonderful work of God through the Lord Jesus 
        Christ for the redemption of the world from sin and eternal damnation. 
        Speaking in unintelligible gibberish can only antagonize the unbelieving 
        and contributes nothing to the spiritual growth of the believer. Believers 
        are benefitted by, and unbelievers are converted by, the gift of prophecy, 
        which proclaims Jesus Christ as the world's only hope for salvation.</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As practiced in Corinth, the 
        gift of tongues was a confused and confusing mess as those who claimed 
        the gift apparently vied with one another to show off the gift in public. 
        Those who claimed the "lesser" gifts were also apparently involved in 
        striving to show them off. And so Paul continues: "What then, brethren? 
        When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a 
        tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification. 
        If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and 
        each in turn; and let one interpret. But if there is no one to interpret, 
        let each of them keep silence in church and speak to himself and to God. 
        Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. 
        If a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first be silent. 
        For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be 
        encouraged; and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. For God 
        is not a God of confusion but of peace" (vs. 26-33).</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We noted earlier that women 
        have taken a leading role in the tongues movement, that they are more 
        easily swayed emotionally and are more readily responsive to the techniques 
        of those who promote the gift of tongues. In every instance with which 
        I am personally acquainted, it is the woman who has led her husband and/or 
        household into the tongues movement and is the first to have received 
        the gift. This was quite apparently true also in Corinth. It is in the 
        context of the statement on tongues that Paul speaks the words that have 
        long been used out of context to oppose woman suffrage in the church. 
        In a less permissive society than ours, when women were little more than 
        chattels and pawns of the male of the species, the women of Corinth apparently 
        found in the gift of tongues an opportunity to assert themselves and to 
        show that they could excel over the men&mdash;at least in things spiritual and 
        religious. And Paul says in this context, "As in all the churches of the 
        saints, the women should keep silence in the churches" (vs. 33, 34).</font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="4">Concluding Remarks</font></b></font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The concluding words of the chapter and section include these words: "So, my brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues; but all things should be done decently and in order" (vs. 39, 40). When I read these words of Paul, " . . . do not forbid speaking in tongues . . ." I remember also the words of Gamaliel: " 'So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men [the Christians] and let them alone; for if this plan or this undertaking is of men, it will fail; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You might even be found opposing God!'" Acts 5:38, 39. I do not go along with the advice of Gamaliel to ignore the Christian movement. It was his responsibility, as a scholar and as a spiritual leader of the Jews, to help the Jews to avoid error and to uncover the truth. If he had done that in this case, he would no doubt have been led to accept the Lord Jesus as the Christ and his Savior. But the caution he gave to the Jews that they might find themselves opposing God Himself, coupled with Paul's words telling the Corinthians not to forbid speaking in tongues, led me to careful second thoughts about taking up opposition to the tongues movement. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am satisfied in my own heart and mind that I must speak out on the subject and stand in opposition to it. I can understand Paul's advice in the Corinthian setting: immovable objection to, and prohibition of, speaking in tongues under the circumstances might only have aggravated the situation and hardened the tongues-speakers in their attitudes. To some extent I would heed the advice of Paul. Anyone who thinks he has the gift of tongues and takes Paul's advice to employ it only privately, is responsible only for himself and to himself and to God. Any who would use the supposed gift publicly and endeavor to propagate the practice among others, I would oppose and forbid to practice tongues-speaking among those over whom the Lord has given me spiritual responsibility&mdash;until it could be proven that the gift was truly a gift of God bestowed spontaneously upon the recipient by the Spirit of God.</font>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have yet to read or hear of a single instance that convinces me the 
          gift is from God. I was even more convinced that it was not a gift of 
          God in reading Aglow with the Spirit, by Dr. Robert Frost, one of the 
          shining lights of the Pentecostal movement. He tells of a minister observing 
          a woman who had come for the so-called "infilling" of the Spirit but who 
          repeatedly expressed herself with only one little syllable that sounded 
          like stammering. But the minister had a vision of a little stalk-like 
          shoot which grew upward each time she uttered the syllable. Presently 
          she found another syllable, and a branch appeared on the shoot. With each 
          new syllable she found, there was another branch on the shoot, until the 
          vision portrayed a beautiful, symmetrical tree. Anyone can perform the 
          same thing by starting with a single syllable and adding other syllables 
          until one is able to speak fluently and at great length&mdash;unintelligibly. 
          Further, I am reminded of the old days when the South was filled with 
          all kinds of tiny "holiness" groups known as Holy Rollers, Holy Weepers, 
          Holy Laughers, Holy Clappers. Whatever the particular group considered 
          an evidence of the baptism of the Spirit or of "getting religion," that 
          was the manifestation which would take place in their revivals. Getting 
          religion or the Spirit would cause the Holy Rollers to roll on the floor, 
          Holy Weepers to weep, Holy Laughers to laugh, and Holy Clappers to clap. 
          And where speaking in tongues is considered a manifestation of the Holy 
          Spirit, a necessary evidence that one is a full Christian, there will 
        be speaking in tongues. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But enough of this, though 
        I could say much more. What I have said is the fruit of independent thinking, 
        of reading authors who are supporters of the tongues movement, and of 
        searching the Scriptures. I pray that I have not succeeded merely in alerting 
        you to, and setting you against, speaking in tongues. I would much rather 
        that we would all learn from those who have gone off at a tangent in this. 
        So many of them got started because they became concerned about their 
        spiritual apathy, indifference and coldness&mdash;and this is a concern that 
        we should all share, for we are certainly not aglow with the Spirit; our 
        lives do not radiate the love, the concern, the dedication to God and 
        our fellow man to the extent that they should. Pentecostals mistakenly 
        seek the solution to their problem in the gift of tongues. They pray for 
        the gift of tongues for their personal assurance of salvation. We should 
        pray that the assurance of salvation, which we possess solely and alone 
        through our God-given faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, will so possess 
        us through the power of the Spirit that it will bring forth in us all 
        the wonderful fruits of the Spirit: "love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, 
        goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control" (Gal. 5:22, 23). Their 
        concern is to propagandize and proselytize and infiltrate for and with 
        their Pentecostal error. Our concern should be to propagandize and proselytize 
        for Jesus Christ our divine Savior and to infiltrate the entire world 
        with the precious gospel of salvation through the atoning blood of our 
        Lord. Amen.</font>
