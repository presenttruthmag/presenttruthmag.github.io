  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><img src="HANDSHAK.GIF" alt="The Handshake" width=400 height=215 border=0 align="right">We are living in an age of unprecedented ecumenical acceleration.</strong> Such is due to the three great &quot;neo's&quot; of the current religious scene neo-Pentecostalism, neo-Romanism and neo-evangelicalism.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Optimism is at an all-time high with regard to the religious ferment of today. Not so long ago, for instance, <em>Christianity Today</em> quoted John A. McKay as saying that the future of Christendom may well lie with a reformed Catholicism and a mature Pentecostalism. Not a few see the &quot;awakening&quot; of today as the greatest religious awakening since Pentecost!</font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The three great &quot;neo's&quot; are
    diverse, and this makes generalizations even more hazardous than usual. However,
    the responsibility of assessing the
    current religious scene, amid its diversity, must not be evaded. It is not
    our intention to magnify excesses or successes but to arrive at the fundamental
    drift
    of the religious ferment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Surely one of the basic aspects
    of any movement or conglomerate of movements is <em>the place of the Bible</em>. In
    the three &quot;neo's&quot; there are passionate
      assertions abounding with reference to the Bible. &quot;The baptism in
      the Spirit&quot; is
      said to give a greater love for the Bible; the &quot;charismatic experience&quot; is
      said to have unlocked the Bible for many. Few have not heard about Rome's &quot;new
      approach&quot; to the Scriptures, her new &quot;open attitude&quot; even
      to the fundamental tenets of Reformation theology. It behooves us to inquire
      into
      these
      assertions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What does the evidence reveal? What
    is the fundamental drift with regard to the Bible? Can it be stated with
    relative safety in a short compass?
        Notwithstanding exceptions here and there, we believe that the general
        drift with reference
        to
        the Scriptures is cause for alarm. For the most part the Bible is subordinated
        to experience. The general drift is toward experience over the Word.
          We suggest that this is anything but a sound platform for the future
          of the
        church! </font></p><p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Neo-Romanism</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following statements
            may be made about new-face Catholicism and the Bible:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">1.</font></strong> Neo-Romanism views the
            Bible in itself differently from the traditional Roman Catholic view
            of the Scriptures. Although the
                Bible was subordinated
      to the Church in traditional Romanism, nevertheless she held a high view
                of the inspiration and inerrancy of the Scriptures. Neo-Romanism
                holds only to
      a qualified inerrancy and authority. This (as is to be expected) is stated
      variously by the different scholars in the progressive movement of the
                  Church of Rome.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="CARDINAL.GIF" alt="Cardinal Newman" width=200 height=243 border=0 align="right"></font><font size="5">2.</font></strong> If the Bible has only a qualified inerrancy and authority, what has absolute authority? In order to come to grips with this question, we recommend that interested readers study the influence of the nineteenth century <strong>John Henry Newman</strong> in Vatican Il's approach to the Bible and revelation. We can only state the crux of his view here: Newman believed that Scripture has reduced only a part of special revelation to written form. There is also revelation which is not found in Scripture &#8211; a nonpropositional revelation. The mind enables the Christian to come to grips with the written revelation, whereas "intuition" (also called "insight") allows access to unscripturated revelation. The revelation grasped by intuition "fills the gaps and puts flesh on the ribs of that which has been committed to writing."<sup>1</sup></font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The famous and popular Hans Kung reflects the same qualification of Biblical authority. Not all the Bible is the Word of God for Kung. In fact he would rather speak of &quot;the infallibility of religious encounter&quot; than the infallibility of the Bible. For Kung the Bible is the nearest that the theologian can come to describing the reality of God and of Christ. This being the case, both the words of the Bible and the theologian are defective.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">3.</font></strong> To sum up, if the Bible
            does not have <em>absolute</em> authority, then absolute authority must be
            placed in man. Despite the obvious
                  differences between new-face
      and old-time Catholicism, this tragic positing of final authority outside
                  the Bible itself is common to both. The religious experience
                  of man still stands
      over the written Word.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Neo-Pentecostalism</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As mentioned earlier, claims
            of greater love for the Bible are not infrequently heard among charismatics
            (and sometimes outside
                the charismatic movement). &quot;The
          baptism in the Spirit&quot; is said to &quot;unlock the Bible&quot; for charismatics.
          To what does the evidence point when we look into charismatic literature? It
          points to the subordination of the Bible to the human spirit &#8211; experience
          over the Word. We make the following observations regarding the charismatic
          use of the Bible:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">1.</font></strong> Frequently
            the Bible is quoted <em>out of its context</em>. When this takes place, a meaning from
            without is imposed on a text or passage. The
            word of man
            is placed over the Scripture and is then called the Word of God.
            We can do this
            with great fervor and enthusiasm, eulogizing the text. But falsification
            of the Word has taken place. &quot;Text out of context is pretext.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">2.</font></strong> In so much charismatic writing there is an alarming <em>superficiality </em>evident in the use of Scripture. A lack of careful consideration of a
              text or passage
              is not the sign of preoccupation with its meaning. A meaning which comes
              from a framework other than the Bible is imported into the Scripture
              despite the
              fact that a closer examination of the text will show another meaning.
              For instance, consider the frequent use of Acts 5:32 to show that obedience
              is a condition
              for the gift of the Spirit. In actual fact the meaning is exactly the
              opposite
              of what the charismatics seek to show. The text says God has given (past)
              the Holy Spirit to those who are now obeying Him (present). Obedience
              is the sign
              of the Spirit, not its precondition! Many other passages could be quoted
              along with references from charismatic literature, but such would be
              space-consuming. Superficiality with regard to the Bible is hardly a
              sign of increased devotion
              to the meaning, the real meaning of Christ's Word!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">3.</font></strong> A third and tragic aspect
            of the charismatic approach to the Bible is that <em>it is just ignored </em>in too many instances. This
                  ignoring of the
                Bible
                is done
                with a show of spirituality, but it is none the less serious
                  and tragic. Frequently, ignoring the Bible takes place under
                  an appeal to the Spirit.
                This appeal,
                however, is an appeal to the Spirit <em>apart from</em> and even <em>over </em>the Word.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example, Dorothy and
            Kevin Ranaghan in their book, <em>Catholic Pentecostals </em>(Parmus, N.Y.:
            Paulist Press, 1969); extol ideas
                  solely upon the
                  basis of experience. Also, in an appendix it is seriously argued
                  that &quot;the values of Pentecostalism
                  as a meaningful and valid part of Christianity can be appreciated
                  from both the theological left and right.&quot; &mdash; p. 261. By
                  the left is meant the radical stream of Robinson and Bultmann,
                  who have plainly
                  discarded
                  the orthodox
                  view
                  of the Bible; and by the right is meant those who still hold
                  to the historic orthodox view. Apparently the Spirit is quite
                  indifferent
                  to the Word. It
                  makes no difference whether the Bible is believed or denied;
                  the Spirit still comes
                  in His glory!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Should Protestants take
            refuge because the preceding citation comes from Roman Catholics,
            here are a couple no less disturbing
                    citations from
                    a Protestant
                    charismatic, J. Rodman Williams, president of Melodyland
                  School of Theology:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;&#8230;
                we often in the past argued the nice points of the &quot;Real Presence&quot; among
                          ourselves. Such now is completely done away, and in the fellowship
                          of the Spirit we sit down together at the Lord's Table not to discuss
                          the Real Presence,
                          but to enjoy it.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I can . . . recall occasions
              of full participation at the Lord's Supper in traditions as widely
              different as
                    Roman Catholic
                            and Assembly of
                            God, Episcopalian
                            and Church of Christ.&quot; &mdash; J. Rodman Williams,
                            <em>The Era of the Spirit </em>(1971), p.45. </font></p>
        </blockquote>        
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The import of what Williams
            says is that the baptism in the Spirit has rendered meaningless the
            old disputes.
                  It appears
                        as though
                        there is
                        a fellowship
                        of the Spirit which is <em>apart from the Word</em> &#8211; yes,
                        even <em>above</em> the Word. Yet nowhere in the Scriptures can
                        we find love for the
                        Bible expressing itself
                        by deliberately ignoring the Word. The tragedy is that
                        such quotations as those
                        just given could be multiplied ad nauseam.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">4.</font></strong> The final point concerning
            charismatics and the Bible is that, essentially, the charismatic
            method of handling
                          the Word
                          is derived
                          from evangelicalism.
                          The charismatic uses an evangelical approach to the
                  Bible and comes up with a different account of the Christian
                          life (though
                          in our estimation,
                          not all
                          that different).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All the things we have said
            about the charismatic's use of the Bible are applicable to evangelicalism
                  also. It
                            is impossible
                            to raise serious
                            questions
                            about the
                            way the charismatic uses the Scriptures without at
                            the same time
            questioning well-entrenched evangelical methods.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This final point, it must
              be remembered, is not expressed by one who is not an evangelical,
              but by one who
                                is evangelical and the principal
                                of
                                an evangelical
                                Bible college in Australia. Behind this last point
                                lies the observation of evangelical young people
                                and their
                                use of
                                the
            Scriptures.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Neo-Evangelicalism</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we come to speak of
            neo-evangelicalism, we do not wish to deny the great benefits that
            have come from neo-evangelical scholarship in Biblical studies.
        The fact remains, however, that the great bulk of evangelical folk have
            their Biblical theology molded by popular convention speakers and
            authors and not
        by solid, sober theologians and exegetes from evangelical ranks. The
            big names in popular evangelicalism are not the names of our better
            theologians
        and exegetes. Often when the work of such scholars is consulted, it is
            consulted in the already fixed framework of the one doing the consulting.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">1.</font></strong> We repeat for emphasis
            that what has been previously said about the neo-Pentecostal and
            the Bible is true of the neo-evangelical
                  Christian. Frequently the Bible
        is treated as a contextless repository of information supportive of a
                  (very unsatisfactory) preconceived view of Christian existence.
                  Superficiality marks
        so much of influential speaking and writing in evangelical circles today.
                  Also, not infrequently, the Bible is just simply ignored. Only
                  recently I was reading
        an earnest statement concerning Christian existence which was quite wide
                  of the Biblical perspective. One of the chief characteristics
                  of the presentation
        was the well-nigh complete absence of Scriptural support.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two chief characteristics
            of so many of the young folk who apply to our college in Australia.
            First, a self-confessed
                  ignorance
          of the Bible.
          (Most of them give the reason for coming to college as &quot;To get
          to know the Bible.&quot;) Second, an unshakable dogmatism in what they
          believe! Wherever they get their theology, it is not from the Word
          of God!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">2. </font></strong>When we say that the
            Bible is so much ignored in neo-Pentecostalism and neo-evangelicalism,
            this raises the question, Where does
            their
            information
            come from? In many instances it comes directly from the Lord Himself &#8211; or
            His Spirit! More than once I have heard popular and influential leaders
            say things which could only be attributed to a &quot;private session
            with the Lord Himself only the night before&quot;! This, we might
            add, apart from the Word!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes evangelical leaders
            will even lay claim to special visions and revelations as the source
            of their (sometimes quite bizarre)
              views. We
              call this &quot;evangelical
              guruism.&quot; But alas, how dominant is this type of thing! This
              is appeal to the Spirit apart from the Word. It is not unfair to
              say that if such
              a position is challenged, there is even appeal to the Spirit over
            the Word!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">3. </font></strong>This leads us to a third
            characteristic of so much popular evangelicalism &#8211; <em>the
                determinative role of experience</em>. If the neo-Pentecostal or the
            neo-evangelical has experienced it, then the Bible must teach it!
            This appeal to experience
            over the Word takes different forms.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example, one of the
            most frequently encountered forms is &quot;the changed
                  life criterion.&quot; How difficult it is to suggest something
                  may not be Biblical if it has changed the person's life! Have
                  you ever tried to get a charismatic
                  to rethink his view when he keeps telling you how great a change
                  it has brought into his life? How much more he loves Jesus
                  because of the experience! This
                  is the pragmatic approach: &quot;It works!&quot; It works;
            therefore it is Biblical.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another form is &quot;<em>the
            great numbers criterion.</em>&quot;&nbsp; If a particular Bible
                    teacher has great crowds flocking to hear him, then surely
            this is a sign that the Lord is endorsing his message. Would the
            charismatic movement be endorsed
                    so heartily were it not so huge and widespread? Would Bill
            Gothard's Institute in Basic Youth Conflicts seem so true if it were
            attended by only 200 people
                    in an obscure part of Los Angeles rather than 18,000 in the
            Los Angeles coliseum? &quot;Might
                    means right&quot; is more a part of our mentality than we
                    realize! It amounts to the fact that great crowds are seen,
                    ipso facto,
                    as the blessing and
                    endorsement of the Lord. The basis of this is a legalistic
                    premise&mdash;the Lord only blesses
            us when we are right.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How difficult it is to get
            people to consider what a person says if that person is in the minority!
            Minority is inferiority
                      while
                      majority
                      is
                      superiority in
            so much evangelical thinking.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In conclusion we suggest
            that the three great &quot;neo's&quot; are fundamentally
                        agreed in this subordination of the Bible to the human
            spirit. Though there are outward differences and even some exchange
            of hostility, herein lies the
            fundamental affinity of the three &quot;neo's.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we speak of experience over the gospel, we are asserting
                          that the<em> message</em> of the Bible is subordinated to the
                          message of man.
                          And when
                          we speak of experience
                          over the Word, we are saying that the <em>meaning</em> of the
                          Bible is subordinated to the meaning which man imposes
                          on the
            Word.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This focuses, we believe,
            the fundamental drift of the current religious scene. We do not suggest
            for
                            a moment
                            that there
                            are no long-lost
                            Biblical elements
                            coming through the three &quot;neo's&quot; (e.g.,
                            the denial of papal infallibility and other emphases
                            of
                            Dr. Kung, the
                            stress of the wide distribution of
                            the gifts of God by the charismatic movement, etc.).
                            But such Biblical elements
                            are within a fundamentally wrong frame-work. We are
                            all, because of our sinfulness, saddled with error.
                            However, it is better
                            to have elements
                            of error in a correct
                            Biblical framework than to have elements of truth
                            in a fundamentally incorrect framework. In this last
                            instance
                            even the elements
                            of truth serve the deeper-lying
            error.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notwithstanding the imperfections
            of the sixteenth century Reformation, it was a Reformation in the
                              true sense of
                              the word. The Word
                              of God dictated the
                              thinking of the Reformers. Today in the supposed
                              reformation to end all reformations, we suspect
                  that the reformers
                              are dictating to
                              the Word
                              what it should say
                              and when it should say it. But there is no genuine
                              movement of the Spirit without a genuine movement
                              of God's gospel
                              and the
                              Word.</font><BR>
