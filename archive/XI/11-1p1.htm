              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="CROWD.GIF" alt="Crowd" width=500 height=200 border=0 align="right"></font>            <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the last few years great changes have taken place in three branches of the
  Christian church &#8211; Pentecostalism, Romanism, and Evangelicalism.</font>
<P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. Pentecostalism</strong></font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The modern Pentecostal movement
    is an off-shoot of the American holiness movement. It made its appearance
    in this country in 1900. One of its
          leaders has called
      it &quot;the greatest ecstatic movement in the history of the Christian
      church.&quot; It
      is distinguished by its overwhelming emphasis on experience &#8211; often
      called the baptism in the Holy Spirit. This baptism is usually, if not
      always, identified
      by ecstatic speech, which Pentecostals call the gift of tongues.&quot; This
      gift of tongues is regarded as the sign that one is baptized in the Holy
      Spirit.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before 1960 Pentecostalism was a
    movement outside the mainstream of the Protestant church. It was very sectarian,
    and most churches looked
          upon Pentecostalism
        as a divisive, offbeat type of religious fanaticism.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About 1960 Pentecostalism took a
    new turn. It began to jump denominational barriers. The ecstatic experience
    of speaking in tongues began to appear
          among conservative Episcopalians, orthodox Lutherans, staid Presbyterians &#8211; indeed
          there was hardly a Protestant church that escaped the Pentecostal invasion.
          This new interdenominational phase of Pentecostalism became known as
          neo-Pentecostalism, or the charismatic movement.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whereas the old (&quot;classical&quot;)
    Pentecostalism was regarded as a divisive and sectarian movement, neo-Pentecostalism
    appears to be uniting
          and non-sectarian.
          Demonstrating a new openness toward all branches of the church, the
    charismatic movement has the ability to break down nearly all denominational
    barriers.
          The Pentecostal experience seems to be available to people of vastly
    different religious traditions, to liberals or conservatives.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the neo-Pentecostal movement
    was getting under way in the Los Angeles area in the early 1960's, I talked
    to an Assembly of God
          preacher about
            the phenomenon. He said, &quot;We used to be the leaders in experiencing
            the baptism in the Holy Spirit, but not since the Spirit has visited
            the great historic
            and Protestant churches. I know an Episcopalian priest in this city
            who is so liberal he neither believes in the virgin birth nor the
            resurrection. Yet
            he has recently received the baptism in the Spirit and exhibits a
            marvelous power in his ministry.&quot; The Pentecostal preacher shrugged
            his shoulders and added, &quot;I can't understand why God would give
            all that power to a fellow so far out on the liberal left.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few months ago a group of Pentecostal
    Christadelphians invited me to talk to them. Christadelphians not only deny
    the divinity
          of Jesus
              Christ,
              but
              also his pre-existence before His birth in Bethlehem. They also
          deny the personality
              of the Holy Spirit. Yet here were a group of Christadelphians who
            claimed the baptism in the Holy Spirit and spoke with tongues.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I cite these cases to show that
    it makes no difference where one stands in the theological spectrum when
    it comes to participating
                in the Pentecostal
                experience. The &quot;gift of the Spirit&quot; seems to be available
            regardless of almost any denominational or doctrinal loyalty.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 1969 the Pentecostal movement
    has made a remarkable penetration into the Roman Catholic Church. Pentecostalism
    appears to be
                  the first factor
                  for more than 400 years which is able to bridge the gulf between
                  Romanism and Protestantism.
                  Dr. Henry van Dusen suggests that it has the potential of healing
                  the wound of the sixteenth century. Pentecostals and Roman
          Catholics are
                  no longer
                  bitter religious rivals in South America. And all over the
          world Protestant and Catholic
                  Pentecostals are meeting together to sing, &quot;We are one
                  in the Spirit.&quot; Says
                  <em>Christianity Today</em> (Feb. 4, 1972, p. 8), &quot;This movement
                  [Pentecostalism) ..., is now becoming ecumenical in the deepest
            sense.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking at the Presbyterian Charismatic
    Conference in March of 1973, the cardinal also said: Our unity has to be
    done quickly
                      because
                      the Holy Spirit
                      is leading
                      it, God is desiring it, and the world is in need, badly
    in need, of that visible unity. . . . I see the heads of the Christian
                      churches
                      coming
                      together. . .
                      . Let us come back home: home means the Upper Room, Pentecost.
                      &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>.,
            pp.8-9.</font>
<P><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. Romanism</strong></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the last few years the Church of Rome has emerged with a new stance. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>a. First</strong>, she appears to be more open to the Bible. Rome has allowed her people free access to the Bible; some of her scholars are foremost in Biblical studies; and Catholics have worked shoulder to shoulder with Protestants in producing new translations from the ancient Biblical texts.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><img src="SUENENS.GIF" alt="Cardinal Suenens" width=300 height=372 border=0 align="right">b. Second</strong>, Rome has, since 1967, shown a real openness toward the neo-Pentecostal movement. Thousands of her priests and nuns are embracing the charismatic movement. In June of this year, more than 20,000 Roman Catholic Pentecostals gathered at Notre Dame University for the seventh Charismatic Renewal Conference. One of the featured speakers was a powerful prince of the Church, <strong>Cardinal Suenens</strong> from Belgium. He came to give his enthusiastic approval to the charismatic movement within the Catholic Church. Said he:</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The charismatic renewal has extraordinary ecumenical implications Many important breakthroughs are happening in a wonderful way in the charismatic renewal. It will be a great impetus for Christian unity. Christians of different churches need to experience themselves as belonging to the same family, as being brothers, and that is happening in the charismatic renewal. &mdash; <em>New&nbsp; Covenant</em>, June, 1973, p.5. </font></p>
</blockquote><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The cardinal stood before the Presbyterians,
      holding the hands of two of their leaders (Jim Armstrong and Rodman Williams)
      and singing, &quot;We are one in
    the Spirit.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>c. Third</strong>, Rome
    has become far more open toward evangelicals. <em>The Catholic Digest,</em> July,
    1972, presented a
  feature
      article lauding Dr. Billy Graham. The Jesuit
      author wrote, &quot;Billy Graham is orthodox. I have read nothing by him
      that is contrary to Catholic faith.&quot; In some places priests are being
      instructed to become familiar in the use of evangelical terminology like &quot;getting
      saved&quot; or being &quot;born again.&quot; Witness how Roman Catholics
      are now able to join with evangelicals in cooperative efforts like Key
      '73. This
      is neo-Romanism &#8211; marked by a new openness to the Bible, to Pentecostals
      and to evangelicals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"><strong>3. Evangelicalism</strong></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the last few years a new
          evangelicalism has also emerged. Neo-evangelicalism began a few years
          ago with many worthy aspirations. It wished to avoid the
    obscurantism (anti-intellectualism), extreme Biblicism, and narrow separatism
    of the right wing fundamentalists. Evangelicals felt a real desire to enjoy
    fellowship with other evangelicals across denominational boundary lines.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently the neo-evangelical
          movement has shown an increasing openness and sympathy toward the charismatic
          movement. If we may take <em>Christianity Today</em>      as representative of the neo-evangelical movement, we may discern a real
          warming of the relationship between evangelicals and Pentecostals.
          A few years ago
          <em>Christianity Today</em> was decidedly negative toward Pentecostalism. Then it
          became tolerant. Now it is very sympathetic. In February, 1972 <em>Christianity
          Today</em>      said: </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">The force that appears to be making the greatest contribution to
                    the current Christian revival around the globe is Pentecostalism.
                    . . . A new era of the
            Spirit has begun. An evangelical renaissance is becoming visible along
                    the Christian highway from the frontier of the sects to the high
                    places of the
            Roman Catholic Communion.</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then in the September, 1973
          issue, well-known evangelical scholar Clark H. Pinnock writes: </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">The new Pentecostal movement seems to this observer
                to be a genuine movement of the Spirit of God renewing His church&#8230;.
                It thrills my soul to see multitudes of people allowing the Spirit
                to operate freely in their
                midst.</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like many evangelicals, Dr.
          Pinnock expresses concern about the excesses of Pentecostalism, but
          one gets the feeling that if these periphery
              excesses could
              be trimmed away, all would be well between evangelicals and Pentecostals.
              We might therefore ask, Is the only difference between evangelicals
              and Pentecostals
              a difference of style? Degree of enthusiasm? Liturgical taste?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Evangelicals are also exhibiting
          a new openness toward Romanism. There is a great deal of optimism about
          the changes which appear
                to be taking
                place in
                the Roman Catholic Church. The June, 1973 issue of <em>Christianity
                Today</em> made this glowing appraisal of Rome's new openness to Pentecostalism:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Call it spiritual renewal,
            revival, or whatever, something big is happening in the Roman Catholic
            Church. . . . [Cardinal
                          Suenens] told <em>Christianity
                            Today</em> that he not only endorses the charismatic renewal
            as an authentic move of the
                            Spirit, but also hopes it will become the mainstream
            of the Catholic Church.</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>A Threefold Union</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neo-Pentecostalism exhibits a new openness toward evangelicals
                            and Roman Catholics. Neo-Romanism shows a new openness
              toward Pentecostals and
                            evangelicals. Not
                            to be outdone, neo-evangelicalism shows a new openness
              toward Pentecostals and Roman Catholics.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This &quot;neo-trio&quot; is
          moving closer and closer together in a growing bond of sympathy. There
          is a reason for this. Each of the &quot;neo-trio&quot; places
                              a unique emphasis on inner experience. The uniting
          factor is that the message of each &quot;neo&quot; is the centrality
          of religious experience.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We choose the words carefully &#8211; &#8220;the
          centrality of religious experience.&quot; No
                                one who believes the Bible questions the importance
          of religious experience, the place of genuine heart religion. But the &quot;neo-trio&quot; has
                                moved religious experience to the center of its
          message.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. Pentecostalism
            and the Centrality of Experience.</strong> Neo-Pentecostal literature is devoted almost
                                  exclusively to experience. It
                                  promotes what promises
                                  to be the exciting or satisfying experience
                of being baptized in the Spirit. Great
                                  use is made of personal testimony. A minister
                                  tells of how he felt a great sensation of peace &quot;right
                                  down to the balls of my feet.&quot; In
                                  the <em>Christian Herald</em> of September, 1972, a
                                  Presbyterian woman testifies of
                                  what it is like

                                            classical medieval doctrine of <em>gratia
                                            infusa</em> knows that the mystical
        inward
      experience of infused grace is the central concern of Roman Catholic piety.
      The charismatic emphasis has found great acceptance in the Roman Church
                                            because, as its theologians have
                                            recognized, Pentecostalism &quot;is
                                            in profound harmony with the classical
                                            spiritual theology of the Church.&quot; Fr.
                                            Edward O'Connor, <em>The Pentecostal
                                            Movement in the Catholic Church</em>,
                                            p. 183. Rome, who has traditionally
      been very uncomfortable with the Protestant doctrine of salvation by imputed
      righteousness, is very much at home where inward experience is the supreme
      emphasis. Roman Catholics have not only embraced the charismatic movement,
      but, as Presbyterian Rev. Robert Whitaker publicly declared, &quot;Catholics
      have brought a depth and a breadth and a sanity which have saved this movement.

        is well
        into the act of selling the gospel of marvelous inward experience. This
        is not a new thing in the evangelical movement. For years revivalism

        laid
        great stress on a very dramatic heart experience. Evangelicals have generally
        had far more to say about the subjective experience of conversion than
        about the mighty acts of our salvation in Christ. Groups like Campus
                                            Crusade for
        Christ make their focus the inward experience of receiving Christ into
