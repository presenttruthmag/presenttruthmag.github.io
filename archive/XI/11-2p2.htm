  Calvin and the Appeal to the Spirit</font></b></FONT><br>
  
<font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="calvin.gif" alt="John Calvin" width="300" height="231" border="0" align="left">Geoffrey J. Paxton</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  
</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Book 1, chapter 9, of his <em>Institutes of the Christian Religion</em>, John Calvin has some timely and helpful comments concerning the Spirit and the Word of God.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>First</strong>, Calvin speaks of a wrong appeal to the Spirit. There is, he says, an extolling of the Spirit which amounts to nothing less than contempt for God's Word. Those who extol the Spirit in this manner effect a separation between the Spirit and the Word. Such a separation finds absolutely no precedence in the apostles of Christ. Calvin proceeds to quote Isaiah 59:21:</font>
  <ul>
    <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My Spirit which is in you, and the words I have put in your mouth, will not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your seed . . . forever.</font>
  </ul>
  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All who separate Spirit and Word separate that which the prophet joined together with an inviolable bond. Calvin then gives us a memorable statement:</font>

<ul>
  <font size="2">
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">". . . the Spirit promised to us [by Christ] has not the task of inventing new and unheard-of revelations, or of forging a new kind of doctrine, to lead us away from the received doctrine of the Gospel, but of sealing our minds with that very doctrine which is commended by the Gospel." &mdash; <em>Institutes,</em> Bk. 1, ch. 9.1.
  </font></font>
</ul>



<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Calvin speaks to all who would separate the Spirit from the Word, whether
  they be ethicists of a situationist stamp, charismatics, or evangelicals. Here
  we have a sober Scriptural injunction: Do not make an appeal to the Spirit
  apart from the teaching of the Scripture. To do so is to put asunder that which
  God has joined together. If we wish to know the Spirit, let us know the Word.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Second</strong>, Calvin tells us how we may
    recognize the Spirit:</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;
          . . . if any spirit passing over the wisdom of God's Word, foists another doctrine
          upon us, he justly deserves to be suspected of vanity and lying.&quot; (Gal.
          1:6-9). &mdash; I<em>bid.</em>, ch. 9.2.</font></p>
</blockquote><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After this statement Calvin poses
    the important question, &quot;. . . what
        authority will the Spirit have among us unless he be discerned by a most
    certain mark?&quot; Satan, we are reminded, disguises himself as an angel
    of light (2 Cor. 11:14). What is this &quot;most certain mark&quot; by which
    we are able to recognize the Spirit and not be tricked by the evil one? The
        answer,
        pure and simple, is <em>the Spirit's agreement with Scripture</em>.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is this putting a test on the Spirit?
    We may say this if we wish. However, Calvin hastens to add that &quot;it
    is a test by which it pleased him to establish his majesty among us.&quot; The
    Spirit is the Author of Scripture, and </font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He cannot vary and differ from Himself. Hence, he must ever remain
                just as He once revealed Himself there. This is no affront to Him...</font>
  </p>
</blockquote><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If teaching does not square with Scripture, then it matters not how
            enthusiastically, influentially, or emotionally it is presented, it
            does not issue from
            the Spirit of God. To honor the Spirit we must honor the Bible; and
            to honor
            the Bible
            means to seek above all things else to arrive at its precise meaning.
            Honoring the Spirit and careful Biblical exegesis are two ways of saying
            the same
            thing.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Third</strong>, for Calvin <em>Word
      and Spirit not only agree, but belong inseparably together.</em> Calvin says that Paul
    calls his ministry &quot;the ministration of the Spirit&quot; (2
            Cor. 3:8), meaning, </font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...doubtless, that the
      Holy Spirit so inheres in his truth, which he expresses in Scripture, that
      only when
        its proper
          reverence and dignity are given
                      to the Word does the Holy Spirit show forth his power.
      &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>.,
          ch. 9.3.</font>
  </p>
</blockquote><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God, Calvin goes on to say, has
    so ordered things that when the Spirit shines, &quot;the
            perfect religion of the Word may abide in our minds.&quot;</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We hear much today about &quot;the
    outpouring of God's Spirit&quot; and the
                    new and epochal &quot;shining of the Spirit.&quot; We must
                    ask, Where is the perfect religion of the Word? A grand display
                    of the
                    Spirit
                    will mean
                    a grand
                    display of the Word. There are those today who see the current
                    charismatic awakening as the greatest revival since Pentecost.
                    Ought we not to
                    see the greatest revival of Biblical preaching and teaching
                    since Pentecost?
                    Alas,
            we see it not!</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Calvin throws some good light upon
    a phrase which is thrown about a lot today: &quot;Quench
                      not the Spirit.&quot; 1 Thess. 5:19. This is often understood
                      to mean that if we are skeptical about so much of today's
                      spirit-centeredness,
                      we are,<em> ipso facto</em>, quenching the Spirit. What is not realized
                      is that it appears from the
                      passage in 1 Thessalonians that the way the Spirit is quenched
                      par excellence is by having a wrong approach to the preaching
                      of the
            Word! Calvin says:</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By this, no doubt, he [Paul] intimates
        that the light of the Spirit is put out as soon as prophecies fall into
              contempt.</font></p>
</blockquote><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Refusing to become preoccupied with
    the Spirit is not to quench the Spirit, but rather the Spirit is quenched
                          when
                          the Word
                          falls into
              contempt.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chapter 9 of the first book of Calvin's
    <em>Institutes</em> is only a short chapter. But how packed full of wisdom
          and insight
                          it is! The current
                          religious
                          scene needs this Biblical and therefore spiritual balance.
                          We fear that the appeal
                          to the Spirit in neo-Pentecostalism, neo-Romanism,
          and neo-evangelicalism is an appeal which, in the final analysis,
                          deprecates the
                          Holy Word of God. If
                          the claims of the enthusiastic adherents of these movements
                          are correct, this age ought to be second only to the
                          apostolic age in the preaching
                          and teaching
                          of the Word. We should be treated to gospel preaching
                          and teaching which overshadows even that of the Reformers
                          and
                          Puritans!
                          Alas, how conspicuous
                          is the lack
            of such today!</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Calvin challenges us to beware
    of falling into the clutches of the one who masquerades as an angel
                            of light.
                            Beware of
                            crying, &quot;The Spirit, the
                            Spirit!&quot; without crying, &quot;The gospel, the
                            gospel!&quot; or, &quot;The
                            Word, the Word!&quot; Any appeal to the Spirit, if
                            it is created by the Spirit Himself, will mean, automatically,
                            an appeal to the
                            Word of God.
                            Those who
            have ears to hear, let them hear. </font>
