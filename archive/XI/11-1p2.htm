  of the New Testament</font></b></FONT><font color="#80000">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="JESCROSS.GIF" alt="Jesus Hanging on the Cross" width=300 height=202 border=0 align="right"></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The apostles were men whose burning passion was the message of God's redemptive acts in Jesus Christ. They turned the world upside down with the preaching of the gospel, not by running around telling people about their exciting religious experiences.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Can you imagine the apostle Peter standing up on the day of Pentecost and declaring, &quot;Friends, I want to tell you about the marvelous experience we had this morning when we were baptized in the Holy Spirit. I felt a great sensation of peace right down to the balls of my feet...&quot; </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Can you imagine one of the Marys
    adding her glowing testimony, &quot;I want to tell you what a thrill it is to speak with
    tongues. All the joys of my life were blended together in one ecstatic moment&mdash;the
    fun of childhood, the excitement of my first date, the exultation of the finished
    sex longing. . .&quot; Ridiculous! This plain fact stands out in Holy Writ:
    Spirit-filled people were so preoccupied with the message of their crucified,
    risen and ascended
    Lord that they made scarcely any reference to their own experience. Their experience,
    of course, was real and genuine. It was the experience of being caught up in
    and identified with the Christ event.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Luke is the New Testament writer
    who makes frequent references to people who were &quot;filled with the Holy
    Spirit.&quot; When Zacharias was &quot;filled
      with the Holy Ghost&quot; (Luke 1:67), he opened his mouth and proclaimed
      God's redemptive works. When the praying disciples were &quot;all filled
      with the Holy Ghost,&quot; Luke very pointedly adds, &#8220;&#8230;and
      they spake the Word of God with boldness&#8230;. And with great power gave
      the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.&quot; Acts.
      4:31, 33.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This pinpoints the vital difference between the Holy Spirit's illumination
          and religious mysticism. When the Spirit is poured out, something is <em>said</em>.
          In mysticism
          something is <em>felt.</em> The one bears testimony to the <strong>objective</strong> message of
          God's redemptive activity on behalf of His people. The other bears testimony
          to
          some <strong>subjective</strong> happening. </font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Nature of the Gospel</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have said that the burning passion
    of the apostles was the gospel &#8211; the
    good news about the Christ event. The gospel is something historical and
    objective. This we must never forget.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When people believe the gospel and
    become preoccupied with God's marvelous work for them in Jesus Christ, it
    certainly brings them a new experience.
      It radically changes them, regenerates, and sanctifies them to a new sort
      of existence
      altogether. All this is the <em>fruit</em> of the gospel. But it is <em>not </em>the
      gospel. The greatest treachery takes place when men take what should be
      the fruit
      of the gospel and make it the gospel. It is like using God's gift of grace
      to
      rob Him of His glory. The New Testament order is:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the gospel does
    not hold first place, it holds no place. Paul's greatest difficulty was with
    people and churches who were continually inclined to place
  the gospel in a subordinate role to their own religious experiences. See it
  in the church at Corinth. What was the issue? Some of the Corinthians were
  becoming so preoccupied with their spiritual gifts that they were forgetting
  the gospel. So Paul had to say to them:</font><font color="#000000">
  </font>
<blockquote>
  <center>
    <p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Moreover,
            brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you,
            which also ye
                  have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved,
            if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed
            in vain.
                  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
            how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and
            that He was buried,
                  and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.1
            Cor. 15:1-4.</font></font><font color="#000000"> </font></p>
    </center>
  </blockquote>
<center>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It
      is not so hard to reconstruct what was happening at Corinth, Galatia, and
      Colosse seeing
      that the believers there faced identical temptations
              to ours.
          False teachers came among the believers, saying, &quot;Paul brought
          you the gospel. That is fine &#8211; just what is needed to start the
          Christian life. Now you must go on and rise higher. We bring to you
          the secret of the deeper
          life, the full gospel, the real secret of victorious living.&quot; This
          was <em>the</em> great heresy of the New Testament church. It was the heresy
          of relegating
          the gospel to something that has great significance at the time of
          Christian initiation; but after that believers were supposed to go
          on to higher things.</font><font color="#000000">

  <p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Luther
      had to contend with the same sort of mentality in his day. The enthusiasts
      were prepared
      to admit that Luther made a good start
            with the doctrine
            of justification through faith in God's work in Jesus Christ. But,
            like neo-Pentecostal
            Dr.
            Rodman Williams of today,<sup>1</sup> they felt that the great Reformer was
      very deficient in his doctrine of the Holy Spirit's work in human lives.
            Wishing to go
            beyond justification by grace, the radical evangelicals cried, &quot;The
            Spirit, the Spirit!&quot; The center of their interest was God's
            work in the human heart, but tragically, like all those who make
            this the center of their message; they
            could not see anything higher than their own spiritual navels.</font><font color="#000000">

  Spirit, who comes to us (because of Christ's atonement) with no modified energy
  but with fullness of divine power. Nothing
  less than Pentecost is needed to see what Christ has done for us. This fact
  is clear from the New Testament record. No gospel sermon was preached until
  Pentecost. Why? It was not until Pentecost that the real significance of the
  Christ event dawned upon the disciples. It was Pentecost which gave to the
  disciples that illumination into Christ's Person and work. Not until Pentecost
  did they fully realize that they had actually been living in the presence of
  the Lord of glory. By the gift of the Spirit they were lost in the awesome
  wonder of the Incarnation, and they could talk of nothing else.</font>

    a visit to this planet in the Person of His Son. It was the Creator of heaven
    and earth who
    was born in that donkey's feed box. It was
  the Lord of glory who was wrapped in those swaddling clothes. He who owned
  the cattle on a thousand hills had not where to lay His head. It was the Judge
  of all who was arrested at midnight by sinful men and arraigned before corrupt
  courts where He was abused, spat on and bruised by unfeeling men. The Judge
  of all became the judged of all. The vile rabble judged Him worthy of death &#8211; not
  a decent death, but the cruelest, most shameful kind of execution reserved
  for those regarded as the scum of the earth. He was treated as a snake, a venomous
  serpent fit only to be crushed and cast out of human society. Thus He became
  the antitype of the serpent which Moses lifted up in the wilderness (John 3:14).
  See Him suspended between earth and heaven as that forsaken, cursed Man. Lifted
  up from earth because earth had refused Him. But not only earth, for heaven
  also numbered Him with the transgressors. God laid our sins upon Him and treated
  Him as we deserve.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we survey God's
    awesome act of atonement in Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit gives us faith
    by hearing the
    message of Christ (Rom. 10:17).
            As John Calvin
          said, &quot;Faith is the principal work of the Holy Spirit.&quot; &mdash;
          John Calvin,<em> Institutes of the Christian Religion,</em> Bk. 3, p. 541. Faith
          is the eye of the
          soul that sees our identity with Jesus Christ. Namely:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He became our Man.
    He took our human nature upon His divine nature. He was our Representative.
    Just as we were
    united to Adam, our first
            head,
            and were
            in Adam when he sinned (and were made sinners by his act of disobedience&mdash;
            Rom. 5:18-19), so it is faith that enables us to see ourselves in
          Jesus Christ. The good news is not only that He lived, died and rose
          again
            for us, but
            that,
            as believers before God, we were in Christ when He lived, died, rose,
            and ascended to glory. It was actually our human nature that lived
            a perfect
            life in Jesus
            Christ 2,000 years ago. It was our humanity which was punished, slain
            and buried in Joseph's new tomb. And when Christ rose from the dead
            and ascended
            into
            glory, we rose in Him and were made to sit down on the right hand
          of God's favor with Him (Eph. 2:5,6). In Christ, God purged us, perfected
            us and
            took us to the throne of glory. The good news is that we have been
            washed clean
            in Jesus Christ and taken into perfect fellowship with God. The good
            news is not, &quot;Be patient, God is not finished with me yet,&quot; but
            it is the message that God has finished with us in Jesus Christ,
            for &quot;ye are complete
            in Him.&quot; Col. 2:10.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We say again that
    the Spirit's chief work is to give us faith &#8211; faith
              which comes by the Spirit's exegesis of the Christ event. Faith
    is the eye of the soul that can see nothing but the glory of Jesus Christ.
    Like the eye,
              it cannot see itself. New Testament faith is not faith in our experience &#8211; it
              is not faith in our new birth; it is not faith in our commitment
              and surrender; it is not even faith in our faith. It is faith in
              Christ's Person and work.</font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Paul reaches his glorious climax in presenting His gospel thesis to the
  Romans, he challenges tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness,
  peril, sword, death, life, angels, principalities, powers, things present and
  things to come to condemn or separate him from the love of God which is in
  Christ Jesus. Upon what was Paul's confidence based? On his Spirit-filled life
  (for Romans 8 is the great chapter on the Spirit-filled life)? Does Paul encourage
  himself by thinking of his new birth, his Spirit-filled ministry or great missionary
  experiences? No! His Spirit-filled life may rightly be called a faith-filled
  life. Faith in what?</font></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who is he that condemneth?
                      It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who
                      is even at the right hand of
                            God, who also maketh intercession for
        us. Rom. 8:34.</font></p>
              </blockquote>              <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">See how the foundation of the apostle's confidence is completely objective.
      It is based wholly on historical, gospel verities.</font></p>

              <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
                  Christ event and the coming of the Holy Spirit &#8211; here are the two
          great themes that must be correctly related. These must not be seen
                  as two focal points which compete for our attention. The New
                  Testament knows of one
          focal point &#8211; the Christ event. The Spirit comes to unfold and
          exegete the significance of that to us.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We
                  therefore must state that the burning passion of the current
                  religious scene
                  lacks the New Testament evidence of the
                        Holy Spirit's work. Instead
            of being
            preoccupied with Christ's Person and work as were the apostles and
            Reformers, the current religious scene is preoccupied with religious
            experiences.
            This is a very serious observation, but most of the current religious
            literature must be thus judged on its own testimony. &quot;Out of
            the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wherever the Spirit is poured out, there you will find men and women
              preoccupied with the gospel&mdash;Christ our Representative, Christ our
              Substitute, Christ
              the Surety of the better covenant, Christ our high-priestly Intercessor
              at the
              right hand of God, Christ guiding the affairs of human history toward
              the day of His coming in glory. We say again that where God's people
              are thus
              preoccupied
              with Christ, there is the true evidence of the Holy Spirit.<br>
