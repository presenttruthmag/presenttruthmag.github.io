      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This brief dialogue illustrates the stark contrast between the character of God and the character of the natural man. God is concerned for man. Man is concerned only for himself. Through sin he has become the wretched victim of subjectivism.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The worst form of subjectivism is religious subjectivism. Man is a sinner precisely because his own experience is the center of his concern; but how much worse when this tendency is stimulated and &quot;sanctified&quot; by religion. A few weeks ago, while on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley, I saw a poster advertising an Eastern religion. The caption read:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You go in 
              and in and in,<br>
          And then you go in and in and in,<br>
          And after that you go in and in and in and in.&quot; </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eastern religions 
        are not the only ones that &quot;go in and in and in.&quot; Subjectivism 
        is the common denominator of all false religions. Instead of curing the 
        sin problem, they make men prisoners within themselves many times more 
        than before. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Objective 
        Nature of the Gospel</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God's cure for subjectivism 
        is the gospel of Jesus Christ. Says the apostle Paul:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Moreover, 
          brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which 
          also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, 
          if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed 
          in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, 
          how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that 
          He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the 
        Scriptures.&quot;1 Cor. 15:1-4.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Christian religion is unique in that it is the only historical religion; i.e., it proclaims a salvation that is based on concrete historical events: the life, death and resurrection of Christ. It is not centered in the worshiper's own experience but in the saving acts of God in Christ &#8211; historical acts that were accomplished outside, above and beyond the sinner's own life. The gospel message is therefore an objective reality.</font> </p>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul's statement of the gospel is all the more remarkable when we consider it in the context of his first letter to the Corinthians. The church at Corinth had become confused about spiritual gifts. Ecstatic religious demonstrations and marvelous experiences were thought to be the proof of the higher Christian life. In chapters 12 to 14 Paul uses a variety of arguments to point out the fallacy of this &quot;charismatic&quot; distortion. But his crowning argument is in chapter 15. He calls the Corinthians back to reconsider the <em>objective</em> gospel. They were in danger of apostasy (2 Cor. 11:3-4).</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul's definition of the gospel seems to be startlingly simplistic: Christ died for our sins, was buried, and rose again the third day. This statement of the gospel makes no reference to subjective religious experience at all. The Corinthians were already far too preoccupied with their &quot;marvelous&quot; religious experiences. Paul seems to be saying to them, &quot;You who are making your boast in your high and mighty experiences are forgetting the gospel which brings you salvation and acceptance with God. None of your charismatic experiences are able to save you or recommend you to God's favor.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The human tendency is to forget the <em>objective</em> gospel and gravitate back to <em>subjectivism</em>. The heretic says, &quot;Who doesn't know that Jesus died and rose again? We can't be forever talking about this. We must rise higher.&quot; Failing to see the glory of the mystery of Christ, he does not see that there is no truth or experience higher than the revelation of Christ crucified.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christ's death, burial and resurrection need to be considered in the light of His position as the second Adam.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;For 
          since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. 
          For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.&quot; 
          1 Cor. 15:21-22.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;Therefore 
          as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; 
          even so by the righteousness of One the free gift came upon all men 
          unto justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were 
          made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.&quot; 
          Rom. 5:18-19.</font><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p><font size="3">Adam was the first head of the human race. Because the 
        whole human race was incorporated in him, he stood before God as if he 
        were every man. When he sinned, the whole race of men became sinners in 
        the sight of God. When he fell, all fell in him. We did not become sinners 
        because of something we did or experienced but by something that happened 
        completely outside of us in the person of Adam, i.e., by a historical, 
        objective event.</font></p>
      </font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God did not redeem us by doing something within our experience. 
        While we were dead in trespasses and sins, He provided humanity with another Father (Isa. 
        9:6), a new Head, a second Adam. Christ now stood before the bar of eternal 
        justice as the representative Man; for by His Incarnation, humanity was 
        legally incorporated in Him as it was in Adam. He stood before God as if He were 
        every man. When He lived, humanity lived <em>in Him</em>; when He was punished, 
        humanity was punished <em>in Him</em>; when He died, humanity died<em> in Him</em>; and 
        when He rose again, humanity was restored to God's favor <em>in Him</em>. All that 
        a father does and acquires belongs to the children. As Luther declared 
        in a sermon preached in 1519 regarding the repentant believer in Christ, &quot;Therefore a man can with confidence 
        boast in Christ and say: 'Mine are Christ's living, doing, and speaking, 
        His suffering and dying; mine as much as if I had lived, done, spoken, 
        and suffered, and died as He did.' &#8220;<em>Luther&#8217;s Works</em> 
        (Philadelphia: Muhlenberg Press, 1957), Vol. XXXI, p.297.</font></p>

          . the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.&quot; 
          Rom. 5:18. God's act of liberation in Christ includes all, even as Adam's 
          fall includes all. In Christ, God has forgiven the sin of the race and 
          reconciled the world unto Himself (Rom. 5:10). &quot;. . . if One died 
          for all, then were all dead.&quot; 2 Cor. 5:14.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"> &quot;There is not one for whose sin and death He did not die, 
              whose sin and death He did not obliterate on the cross, for whom He 
              did not positively do the right, whose right He has not established. 
              There is not one to whom this was not addressed as his justification 
              in His resurrection from the dead. There is not one whose man He is 
         not, who is not justified in Him.&quot; &mdash; Karl Barth, <em>Church Dogmatics</em> (Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1936), Vol. IV, Bk. 1, p.630. </font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A football fan goes 
        to see a super bowl game. As he sits watching from the bleachers, his favorite 
        star gets the ball and makes a spectacular touchdown. His team wins. The 
        fan rises from his seat, throws his hat into the air with ecstasy and 
        cries, &quot;We have won!&quot; He does not hesitate to say &quot;we&quot; 
        even though the whole game was won without any effort on his part. If 
        people can become so excited over the exploits of a few men running around 
        with a bit of pig skin, what profound joy should animate the heart of the repentant believing sinner 
        as we consider the greatest contest of all eternity! Christ, the Son 
        of the eternal God, came to earth to take our very place in the arena 
        of life and death. In our name and on our behalf He ran to the finish 
        line to win for us an eternal victory. &quot;It is finished!&quot; he 
        cried. By His death He destroyed sin &#8211; our sin (Heb. 1:3), crucified 
        our old sinful nature (Rom. 6:6), defeated Satan &mdash; our foe (John 16:11; 
        Heb. 2:14), abolished death (2 Tim. 1:10), perfected His believing repentant people forever 
        (Heb. 10:14) and brought in everlasting righteousness (Dan. 9:24). There 
        is no more need to serve sin, obey our sinful nature, do Satan's bidding 
        or fear death. Looking to Christ's substitutionary work, we can triumphantly 
        cry, &quot;We have won!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Picture a raging stream 
        that we are required to cross in order to be saved. Treacherous rapids 
        beat on murderous rocks and defy any hope of our swimming across. Then 
        comes a mighty athlete who takes our cause upon himself. He plunges in 
        and strikes across for the other shore. At times it seems that he must 
        surely perish in the boiling, rocky stream. Finally he struggles up yonder 
        bank and raises his arm in a salute of victory. Now Christ is not such 
        a One who stands on the other side and cries, &quot;I showed you how to 
        do it. Now plunge in and do as I have done.&quot; When He crossed that 
        river of death and destruction, we were in Him, and He carried the believer
        across in Himself. We triumphed in Him. That is the gospel.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gospel is about 
        Christ (Rom. 1:3) &#8211; about His doing and dying, and about God's awesome 
        act of redemption <em>in Him</em>. This historical, objective event is the believer's salvation 
        and the science and song of the unfallen angels. Any human experience, 
        other than Christ's experience for us, is very small by comparison and 
        should never be the focal point of our concern, much less of our Christian 
        witness. No wonder Paul declared to the experience-centered charismatics 
        at Corinth, &quot;I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus 
        Christ, and Him crucified.&quot; 1 Cor. 2:2.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Says one, &quot;I 
        know that the gospel is about what Christ did for me. But what about the 
        Holy Spirit? The full gospel is the good news of what God does in me.&quot; 
        Instead of leading men to bask in the light of the gospel, this &quot;full 
        gospel&quot; leads multitudes to wallow and drown in a sea of subjectivism.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus said, &quot;When

          to Himself. This profound statement, expressed so simply, indicates 
          that the entire ministry of the Spirit is away from Himself. All endeavors, 
          whether by the individual Christian or by a church or denomination, 
          to place the Holy Spirit at the center of their attention and instruction 
          is, therefore, under divine censure.&quot; &mdash;Victor Matthews, <em>Growth

      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Holy Spirit does 
        not speak of Himself. Neither will anyone who is filled with the Spirit. 
        Many times we have had people stand up in our forums and declare something 
        like this: &quot;I am a Spirit-filled believer. Now let me tell you about 
        my experience. . . &quot; They want to tell what it feels like to receive 
        the Holy Spirit. Others write in detail about how the Spirit gives them 
        marvelous religious sensations, as one clergyman said, &quot;right down 
        to the balls of my feet.&quot; But can we imagine Peter standing up on 
        the Day of Pentecost, proclaiming, &quot;Men and brethren, I have just 
        received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and I want to tell you how wonderful 
        it is. When it came upon me, it was like being thrilled with a vital electric 
        current. I felt such a beautiful love and peace thrill through my whole 
        body, right down to the balls of my feet . . . &#8220; On the contrary, 
        Peter made no reference to himself or to his feelings. His message was 
        Jesus Christ and Him crucified: &quot;Ye men of Israel, hear these words; 
        Jesus of Nazareth, a Man approved of God...&quot; Acts 2:22.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;He shall not 
        speak of Himself.&quot; The great affirmation of the apostles was the 
        gospel &mdash; God's act of redemption in Jesus Christ. They did not turn the 
        world upside down by telling people about their own exciting experiences 
        in the Spirit. (Pride is never so high as when it has a startling experience 
        to relate, especially a religious experience!) The record says, &quot;With 
        great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord 
        Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.&quot; Acts 4:33. In his Corinthian 
        letters, Paul shows how repugnant it was to him to parade his experiences 
        as the charismatic &quot;apostles&quot; did (see 2Cor. 11).</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;He shall glorify 
        Me.&quot; The Holy Spirit's work is to make men Christ-conscious. He never 
        causes men to focus on their own subjective experiences but leads sinners 
        out of themselves to behold what God has done outside of themselves in 
        the person of Jesus Christ. In this the Spirit's work is objective.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have seen that 
        the work of reconciliation has been done for all men <em>in Christ</em>. Christ was born, 
        died and has risen for the sake of all. God's act of liberation in Jesus 
        has been effected and offered for all who believe in Him, and all 
        repentant believing sinners <em>shall</em> <em>personally</em> be justified when they believe and <em>keep on</em> believing (Rom. 5:18). </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, all men have not as yet heard, <em>received</em> and possessed their possessions<em> in Christ</em>. Here is the Spirit's work. 
          Without the work of the third Person of the Godhead, the sacrifice of 
          Christ would be of no avail. Men must hear the gospel of what Christ has 
          done, and they must be persuaded to believe and accept God's gracious 
          provision in His Son. This is the Spirit's work. He comes to create faith 
          by the preaching of the gospel. &quot;Now we have received, not the spirit 
          of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things 
          that are freely given to us of God.&quot; 1 Cor. 2:12.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Faith is not self-generated. 
        Calvin expressed the view of all the Reformers when he said,&quot;. . 
        . faith is the principal work of the Holy Spirit.&quot; Again he says, 
        &quot;We have said that perfect salvation is found in the person of Christ. 
        Accordingly, that we may become partakers of it, 'He baptizes us in the 
        Holy Spirit and fire' [Luke 3:16], bringing us into the light of faith 
        in His gospel. . . &quot; John Calvin,<em> Institutes of the Christian 
        Religion</em>, (Philadelphia: the Westminster Press, 1960), Bk. III, pp.541-542.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Salvation has been 
        freely provided for all in Jesus. The Spirit first works  to bring conviction of  guilt and sin to all who hear God's word. Then He enables convicted sinners to find forgiveness and eternal life by faith in the sinless life and atoning death of Christ on the cross of Calvary. </font></p>

            (John 3:36; 1 John 5:10). The unpardonable sin is to believe not. If any 
            reason could be given for it, it would not be unpardonable. We cannot

        Faith &mdash; not feelings, euphoria, ecstasy or demonstrative spiritual exercises 
        &mdash; is the principal work of the Spirit. Feelings, rapture, and extraordinary 
        spiritual manifestations are subjective. The Christian is not saved by 
        them nor can he live in security before God by these things. But faith 
        is objective. It is always &quot;faith to God-ward&quot; (1 Thess. 1:8). 
        It is the eye of the soul. Like the eye, it cannot see itself. It looks 
        to the glory of the person of Christ and appropriates the merit of His sinless life and atoning death on the cross for the 
        needy soul. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no saving virtue in faith itself but in the <em>object</em>        of faith&mdash;Christ Himself. Just as the football fan identifies himself with 
          his favorite team and cries, &quot;We have won!&quot; so by faith the 
          believing guilty soul identifies with Christ and says, &quot;When Christ lived, I lived 
          in Him; when He died, I died in Him; and when He arose, I arose in Him.&#8221; &#8220;Mine are Christ's living, doing, and speaking, His suffering and

          died as he did'&quot; (see <em>Luther's Works, loc. cit</em>.).</font></p>            
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again we say, Faith 
        is <em>objective</em>, for it glories alone in Christ's <em>doing and dying</em>. Although 
        it is rooted in the heart, it rests upon something which is completely 
        <em>outside</em> the heart. It is the eye of the soul that beholds the glory of 
        Christ. And faith is the Spirit's work. When religious people are devoid 
        of the &quot;Spirit of faith,&quot; they try to find some confirmation 
        and security in <em>tangible</em> demonstrations; hence the temptation to put God 
        to the test in the appeal for charismatic manifestations.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now faith, being a 
        gift of God through the Spirit, becomes a living, busy, active principle 
        in the life of the believer. As Paul explained to the Galatians, faith works by love (Gal. 
        5:6). Love is also objective. It &quot;seeketh not her own&quot; (1 Cor. 
        13:5). Self is not the center of its concern. It is self-forgetful, for 
        faith has released the soul from the intolerable burden of looking for 
        salvation and forgiveness within its own experience. Through Isaiah, God rebukes subjective 
        religiosity and calls men to serve Him by <em>unselfish</em> service for others, 
        feeling or no feeling:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Is not this 
          the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo 
          the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break 
          every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou 
          bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, 
          that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?&quot; 
          Isa. 58:6-7.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Love is obedient.<sup>1</sup>        Bible obedience is not a matter of following uncertain voices within our 
        own hearts, confounding human impulse with the movings of the Holy Spirit. 
        The Holy Spirit teaches believers to obey God by conforming the life to 
        the objective Word and law of God as the unerring, absolute standard of 
        right and wrong.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Karl Barth was once asked what was 
        the most profound thought he had discovered in a lifetime of study. He 
        replied:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Jesus loves 
          me! This I know, <br>
          For the Bible tells me so.&#8221;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That old song for 
        children proclaims a gospel theology,  
        because its criterion of truth is objective.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gospel of Christ 
        is objective, for it points the guilty sinner (a victim of subjectivism) to something 
        which is completely outside of his own experience. The Holy Spirit comes 
        to cause the repentant sinner to make the experience of Christ the foundation of his hope 
        and crown of his rejoicing. By beholding the glory of Christ through the 
        revelation of the Spirit, he is brought out of himself to live in Jesus 
        Christ. His life has a new center. He is delivered from the prison of 
        subjectivism. This is what Paul means when he says, &quot;Therefore if 
        any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; 
        behold, all things are become new.&quot; 2 Cor. 5:17</font>.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><sup>1</sup> It is commonly and erroneously 
        thought that <em>agape</em> love is an emotion. The charismatic movement 
        confounds <em>eros</em> with <em>agape</em>. In this kind of revivalism, 
        people can become very infatuated with a sensual and exciting experience 
        which is called &quot;love.&quot; But <em>agape</em> is a <em>principle</em> that 
        transcends any feelings of rapture.</font></p>
