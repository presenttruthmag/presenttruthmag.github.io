      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Word of God is a sharp, two-edged sword (Heb. 4:12). The two cutting edges are the law and the gospel. As the Protestant reformer Melanchthon points out in his <em>Apology of the Augsburg Confession</em>, &quot;All Scripture ought to be distributed into these two principal topics&quot; (see <em>Book of Concord</em> [St. Louis, Mo.: Concordia Publishing House,1957], p.32). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the Formula of Concord <sup>1</sup> declares:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;These two doctrines belong together and should always be urged by the side of each other, but in a definite order and with a proper distinction, and the Antinomians or assailants of the law are justly condemned, who abolish the preaching of the law from the church, and wish sins to be reproved, and repentance and sorrow to be taught, not from the law, but from the gospel... These two doctrines, we believe and confess, should ever and ever be diligently inculcated in the Church of God even to the end of the world.&quot; </font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&#8212;</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em> Ibid</em>., pp.260-261.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such clear statements are not confined to the Lutheran confessions, but similar statements are also found in the founding articles of the Reformed and Anglican Churches. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We agree with Edmund Schlink, who says, &quot;As the law cannot be preached without Christ, so Christ's work cannot be preached without the law.&quot; </font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&#8212;</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Edmund Schlink, <em>Theology of the Lutheran Confessions</em> (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1961), p.86. The gospel is no great glory to those who have never stood before Mount Sinai, so to speak, and trembled before the awesome majesty of God's law. Those who have never felt the strength of sin (which is by the law) can never appreciate the joy and sweetness of the gospel. See how the apostle Paul uses the law in Romans (chs. 1-3) to prepare our hearts for the hearing of the gospel. It is certain that those who do not hear the law cannot hear the gospel. Neither can Christ's work for us be understood or appreciated apart from the law.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <p><font size="4"><strong>The Law of Love</strong></font></p>
      <p>Law is the basis of all good government. No government can exist without 
        law. God has a law which is the basis of the divine government. One word 
        may be used to summarize that law: love (Rom. 13:8-10).</p>
      <p>Love is not a feeling of ecstatic pleasure. It is not a high religious 
        rapture. It is an eternal principle, or law, of life. God has not left 
        sinful mortals to work out their own interpretation of love but has carefully 
        shown what is involved so that only the most obstinate need remain in 
        ignorance.</p>
      <p><a name="tencommandments" id="tencommandments"></a>If you pass light through a spectrum or glass prism, it breaks down into 
        the colors of the rainbow. We then realize that light is the combination 
        of the colors of the rainbow. When love is placed under the prism of God's 
        Word, we may see that it is a combination, or blending, of ten eternal 
        principles. These ten aspects of love are verbalized in the Ten Commandments:</p>
      </font>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. Loyalty.</strong> &quot;Thou shalt have no other gods before 
            Me.&quot; God is our Creator and Redeemer. Therefore we should love Him 
            before everything else. He is to be first and last and best in everything. 
            Love is loyal.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. Faithfulness.</strong> In forbidding us from worshiping a 
            god of our own making, the Lord says, &quot;I the Lord thy God am a jealous 
            God.&quot; He is the Husband of His people. Love requires faithfulness 
            in our covenant to love Him with the kind of devotion that belongs to 
            no other. The Bible uses the marriage covenant and relationship to illustrate 
            the kind of faithfulness that love to God requires. The prophets likened 
            Israel's unfaithfulness to the covenant-keeping Yahweh as harlotry and 
            whoredom. Apostasy is spiritual adultery.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>3. Reverence.</strong> God's name is holy and is to be held in 
            awe and reverence. Reverence is the foundation of all true worship. God 
            cannot do anything with an irreverent man. Popular revivals often try 
            to make God into a popular somebody. The irreverence of much within the &quot;Jesus movement&quot; is blasphemy. As Luther said about the charismatics 
            of his day, &quot;They talk to God as if He were a shoemaker's apprentice.&quot; Love is reverent.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>4. Holiness.</strong> The fourth precept of the Decalogue was 
            given to inculcate and illustrate holiness&mdash;wholeness for God, sanctification, 
            separation, and dedication to His service. Holiness is not rapture or 
            the exercise of a high degree of religious feelings under extraordinary 
            circumstances. It is doing the will of God, obeying His Word with unquestioning 
            confidence. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Love is holy and by resting from his labors on the Sabbath the believer acknowledges not only Christ as his Creator, but also Christ the Savior   who justifies and sanctifies all who trust in His finished work  on  Calvary. Just as Christ the Creator declared  the creation week to be finished and rested on the Sabbath, so Christ hung upon the cross and cried out, &quot;It is finished&quot; and rested in the tomb on the seventh day having finished His work of redemption. Even so the believer is invited to rest in His finished work of redemption by resting with Him on the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a celebration of a <em>finished</em> creation <em>and</em> a <em>finished</em> work of redemption. </font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hebrews 4:3-11   For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said: &quot;So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest,' &quot; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. 4 For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: &quot;And God rested on the seventh day from all His works&quot;; 5 and again in this place: &quot;They shall not enter My rest.&quot; 6 Since therefore it remains that some must enter it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience, 7 again He designates a certain day, saying in David, &quot;Today,&quot; after such a long time, as it has been said: &quot;Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts.&quot; 8 For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day. 9 There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. 10 For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His. 11 Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience. </font></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>5. Respect for Authority.</strong> The fifth commandment enjoins 
            respect, not only for parents, but for all legitimate authority. Love 
            is not lawless or disorderly. It does not disrespect those over us in 
            positions of authority. Paul warned Timothy, &quot;This know also, that 
            in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of 
            their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient 
            to parents, unthankful, unholy... &quot; 2 Tim. 3:1-2.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>6. Respect for Life.</strong> &quot;Thou shalt not murder,&quot; 
          like the other commandments, is exceedingly broad. In His Sermon on the 
          Mount, Jesus showed that He did not come to weaken, much less do away 
          with, the Decalogue, but to show its far-reaching claims. To be angry 
          with a brother without cause or to rail on him is to be in danger of judgment 
          and hell-fire. Love will seek to preserve and promote life, not destroy 
          and murder, even as Christ said, &quot;The thief cometh not, but for to 
            steal, and to kill, (murder) and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, 
            and that they might have it more abundantly.&quot; John 10:10. Paul also 
            said, &quot;What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy 
            Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?&quot; 
          1 Cor. 6:19. &quot;If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God 
            destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.&quot; 1 Cor. 
            3:17. Multitudes of professed Christians live intemperately, abuse their 
            health and indulge themselves in debilitating habits, not knowing that 
            for all these things God shall bring them into judgment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>7. Purity.</strong> 
          Love is pure. Jesus warned us that the last days would be marked by the 
          kind of widespread immorality which existed in the time of Noah and Lot. 
          We scarcely need to be reminded that we are living in the midst of an immoral 
          revolution. The church is supposed to be the salt which preserves society 
          from utter corruption, but what can we expect when professed churches of 
          Christ become a cage of every unclean and hateful bird? <em>The San Francisco 
          Chronicle</em> of January 5, 1972 reported:</font> </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Homosexuals 
                were blessed as psychologically fit for the ministry by a narrow vote 
                of the First Congregationalist church yesterday. (Resolution to ban 
                them was defeated by 68 votes to 63).&quot;</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the minority 63 delegates 
            did not get up and get out of a church like that, they too have lost all 
            sense of the abominable condition of such a church.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>8. Honesty.</strong> 
          Love is honest, and it always gives good measure, pressed down and running 
          over.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>9. Truthfulness.</strong> 
          Jehovah is a God of truth, and His Spirit is called the Spirit of truth. 
          We are commanded to speak the truth in love (Eph. 4:15).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>10. Contentment.</strong> 
          The selfish heart will always covet; but where love is, there will be 
      &quot;godliness with contentment.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is love. Love is loyal, 
        faithful, reverent and holy. It respects authority and life. It is pure, 
        honest, truthful and contented. The Ten Commandments describe the kind 
        of people God will have in His kingdom. Everything contrary and rebellious 
        to these eternal principles of a righteous character will be shut out. 
        Sin needs to be clearly defined, and in the Ten Commandments it is so 
        clearly defined that both learned and ignorant may understand. Sin is 
        the transgression of this law (1 John 3:4), and the wages of sin is death 
        (Rom. 6:23).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To transgress the Decalogue 
        is an affront to the awesome majesty of a sin-hating God. That Israel 
        might know something of the terrible majesty and sacred character of His 
        law, God brought them to Mount Sinai. As God spoke the Ten Words in the 
        hearing of the people, the whole mountain was enveloped in fire and smoke, 
        and the earth shook at the voice of the Eternal. The people were in fearful 
        terror, and even Moses declared, &quot;I exceedingly fear and quake.&quot; 
        The people cried, &quot;Let not God speak with us, lest we die.&quot; 
        Sinful mortals were not even able to hear the law, much less do it!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When God invited the people 
        at Sinai to enter into covenant with Him, they confidently declared, &quot;All 
        that the Lord hath spoken we will do.&quot; Ex. 19:8. The Lord said to 
        Moses, &quot;They have well said all that they have spoken. O that there 
        were such an heart in them, that they would fear Me, and keep all My commandments 
        always, that it might be well with them. ... &quot;Deut. 5:28-29. God 
        knew that the sinful heart of man would not keep its best resolutions. 
        Within a few days Israel forgot God and entered into the wildest religious 
        orgy. And as long as anyone has nothing better to trust in than his promises 
        to God, he will be under the law without hope of justification or pardon.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The New Covenant</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new covenant is based on 
        better <em>promises</em> (Heb. 8:6) &#8211; not a better law or a better government 
        or even better conditions, but a promise based on an oath (Heb. 6:16-18). 
        A covenant has two parties. The old covenant was between God and the people. 
        The new covenant was between God and Christ (Zech. 6:12-13). It was an 
        everlasting covenant, a plan which existed from times eternal (see Rom 
        16:25, R.S.V.).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the new covenant, Christ 
        stands in the place of the people. He becomes the Substitute and Surety 
        for them. In their name and on their behalf, He makes an oath to God: 
        &quot;All that the Lord hath said I will do.&quot; Thus, &quot;when the 
        fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, 
        made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might 
        receive the adoption of sons&quot; (Gal. 4:4-5).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Righteousness is obedience 
        to the law. This the sinner owes to the law, but he is incapable of rendering 
        it (Rom. 8:3). With infinite pity, the Son of God looked upon the lost 
        race, but He could not indulgently save them. If He was to save them, 
        He must save them in a way consistent with the perfect justice of a righteous 
        law. He chose to undertake for them, to step down, to stand in their place 
        and to render to the law all that it required. He did it because His love 
        called Him that way. For Him heaven was not a place to be desired while 
        we were without God and without hope in the world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the person of His Son, the 
        eternal God came to this planet. He humbled Himself to take the form of 
        man, as a man He humbled Himself to become a servant, and as a servant 
        He humbled Himself to death, even the death of the cross (Phil. 2:5-8).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second Person of the Godhead 
        partook of the substance and essence of human nature as it was <em>affected</em> 
        by sin but not <em>infected </em>by sin. As true man &#8211; indeed, as 
        the representative Man &#8211; He lived the law of God. He was the law, 
        the Word, the Ten Words made flesh; &#8220;&#8230; (and we beheld His 
        glory, the glory as of the Only Begotten of the Father,) full of grace 
        and truth&quot; (John 1:14). In our name, He gave to the law a life that 
        equaled its broadest claims. The obedience of Jesus was the obedience 
        that the law required of us. He was always loyal (&quot;I must be about 
        My Father's business&quot;), faithful, reverent, holy, respectful, pure, 
        honest, truthful and contented.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The righteous demands of the 
        law could not be met alone by the holy living of our Substitute. We have 
        sinned, and justice demands that the death penalty be executed. Here again, 
        Christ took our place to make entire satisfaction to the law on our behalf.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Jesus entered the Garden 
        of Gethsemane on the night of His betrayal, His soul was overwhelmed with 
        a superhuman sorrow. He said to His disciples, &quot;My soul is exceeding 
        sorrowful, even unto death.&quot; Leaving them at the entrance of the 
        garden, He staggered on alone. The sins of the whole world rolled like 
        a mountain on His divine soul until He began to sweat drops of blood. 
        It was in a garden that the first Adam sold the race to Satan. It was 
        in a very different garden that Jesus made the final decision to redeem 
        the race.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Behold now! The Judge of all 
        becomes the Judged of all. Adam in Eden blamed God for his sin. So has 
        every sinner. God says, &quot;Very well, I will take the blame!&quot; 
        The Judge steps down and invites sinners to judge Him. And judge Him they 
        did. He was arrested at midnight as if He were a wild animal. He was arraigned 
        before corrupt courts, abused, spat upon, derided, lashed, crowned with 
        thorns. When Pilate invited men to choose between Jesus, the Son of God, 
        and Barabbas, the murderous robber, they overwhelmingly called for Barabbas; 
        as if to say, &quot;Barabbas is a very saint compared to Jesus.&quot; 
        He was judged as if He were a snake, a venomous, poisonous snake, unfit 
        to live on this planet. &quot;Away with Him I&quot; they cried. &quot;Let 
        Him be crucified!&quot; And so He was led forth before the rage of an 
        infuriated mob to die a most cruel and shameful death.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mystery of human sin is 
        that they hated Him &quot;without a cause&quot; (John 15:25). But greater 
        yet is the mystery of love, that He could love them without a cause. The 
        blacker the night, the more brilliant the stars. His love for sinners 
        became stronger and stronger as they hated Him more and more.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He was lifted up from earth 
        on the cross because earth had refused her King. And not only earth but 
        Heaven too, for He was now the sinner in the awful reckoning of God. </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As Moses lifted 
          up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted 
          up&#8230;&quot; John 3:14. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For He hath 
          made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the 
          righteousness of God in Him.&quot; 2 Cor. 5:21.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Transgressors cannot 
          dwell with God.<br>
          They have no ray of light;<br>
          So Christ saw not the Father's face,<br>
          Only eternal night.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the darkness and despair 
        of eternal separation from God gathered about the soul of Christ, He suffered 
        anguish so great that His physical pain was hardly felt. This was infinite 
        suffering that would make the suffering of all the holy martyrs combined 
        appear as nothing. This was infinite humiliation, for there was no lower 
        place for the King of glory to go.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The awful sense of being separated 
        from God forced from His parched lips the awful cry, &quot;My God, My 
        God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?&quot; The answer is in Romans 3: &quot;Because 
        there is none righteous, no, not one. No one understands, no one seeks 
        after God.&quot; But we may now cry, &quot;My God, my God, why hast Thou 
        accepted me?&quot; And the gospel answers: &quot;Because there is One 
        righteous, yes, just One.&quot; God promised Jeremiah that He would spare 
        Jerusalem from the Babylonians if he could find one righteous man in it 
        (Jer. 5:1). But more amazingly, God covenanted to save the world for one 
        righteous Man. Christ chose to be that One. Said Luther:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Our most merciful 
          Father, seeing us to be oppressed and overwhelmed with the curse of 
          the law, and so to be holden under the same that we could never be delivered 
          from it by our own power, sent his only Son into the world and laid 
          upon him all the sins of all men, saying: Be thou Peter that denier; 
          Paul that persecutor, blasphemer and cruel oppressor; David that adulterer; 
          that sinner which did eat the apple in Paradise; that thief which hanged 
          upon the cross; and briefly, be thou the person which hath committed 
          the sins of all men; see therefore that thou pay and satisfy for them. 
          Here now cometh the law and saith: I find him a sinner, and that such 
          a one as hath taken upon him the sins of all men, and I see no sins 
          else but in him; therefore let him die upon the cross. And so he setteth 
          upon him and killeth him. By this means the whole world is purged and 
          cleansed from all sins, and so delivered from death and all evils. Now 
          sin and death being abolished by this one man, God would see nothing 
          else in the whole world, especially if it did believe, but a mere cleansing 
          and righteousness.&quot; &mdash; Martin Luther, <em>Commentary on Galatians</em> 
          (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans' Publishing Co., 1930), p.272.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the cross, Christ exhausted 
        the penalty of the law and provided a pardon. He reconciled the prerogatives 
        of justice and mercy. Two things were accomplished: the integrity of God's 
        law was upheld, and salvation was provided for sinners. The object of 
        the atonement was not only redemption for the fallen race, but that the 
        divine law and government might be maintained and vindicated. As Flavell, 
        that great Puritan author, said, &quot;Never was the law of God more honored 
        as when the Son of God stood before its bar of justice to make reparations 
        for the sins of men.&quot; The cross enables God to justify sinners without 
        detracting from the dignity or claims of His righteous law.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having given to the law all 
        it required of the fallen race, Christ cried, &quot;It is finished!&quot; 
        On the cross He destroyed sin, abolished death, defeated Satan, opened 
        Paradise and shut the gates of hell. It was for us He did it. His victory 
        is ours. It was secured in our name. The incarnation means that we were 
        in Him when He lived and died. Therefore we have fulfilled the law in 
        Him. If the football fan can cry, &quot;We have won!&quot; when his team 
        wins, how much more should we cry, &quot;We have won!&quot; as we identify 
        ourselves with the life and death of Jesus. This is the gospel. We have 
        won &mdash; by Him and in Him. We have been redeemed by perfect obedience to 
        the law of God &mdash; not ours but His. (And yet, what is His is ours.) This 
        is an eternal victory. Genuine Christian experience comes by glorying 
        in His.</font></p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But one of 
          the soldiers with a spear pierced His side, and forthwith came there 
          out blood and water. And he that saw it bear record, and his record 
          is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.&quot; 
          John 19:34-35.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Blood.</strong> 
        &quot;Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved 
        from wrath through Him. &quot; Rom. 5:9. Sinners are justified by Christ's 
        perfect obedience and satisfaction which He gave to the divine law on 
        our behalf. The gospel takes the law seriously.&quot;. . . the doers of 
        the law shall be justified.&quot; Rom. 2:13. When we as repentant guilty sinners believe on Jesus, 
        His doing and dying are credited to us, and thus we are justified by perfect 
        obedience to the law. Justification and faith have no meaning apart from 
        the law of God.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Water.</strong> 
        &quot;He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his 
        belly shall flow rivers of living water. (But this spake He of the Spirit, 
        which they that believe on Him should receive&#8230;)&quot;John 7:38-39. 
        The benefits of the new covenant are renewal by the Holy Spirit as well 
        as forgiveness. Writes the apostle, &quot;&#8230;This is the covenant 
        that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put 
        My laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; and their 
        sins and iniquities will I remember no more.&quot; Heb. 10:16-17.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let those who want to major 
        on experience and the Holy Spirit, measure up to the great office work 
        of the Spirit. True experience is important. It is not rapture and ecstatic 
        feelings, but it is having the law which Christ died to vindicate written 
        in our hearts and carried out in our lives. This is worth more than all 
        the noise of the charismatic movement. The &quot;normal&quot; Christian 
        life of faithfulness and obedience must not be undervalued. It may not 
        be as spectacular as some other things that people tend to run after, 
        but it is of great price in the sight of God. Let those who value miracles 
        consider that the greatest miracle is a life that is loyal, faithful, 
        reverent, holy, respectful, pure, honest, truthful and contented.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Says Melanchthon in his <em>Apology</em>:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is written 
          in the prophet Jer. 31, 33: 'I will put My law in their inward parts 
          and write it in their hearts.' And in Rom. 3, 31, Paul says, 'Do we, 
          then, make void the Law through faith? God forbid! Yea, we establish 
          the law.' And Christ says, Matt. 19, 17: 'If thou wilt enter into life, 
          keep the commandments.' Likewise, 1 Cor. 13, 3: 'If I have not charity 
          it profiteth me nothing.' These and similar sentences testify that the 
          Law ought to be begun in us, and be kept by us more and more [that we 
          are to keep the Law when we have been justified by faith, and thus increase 
          more and more in the Spirit]. Moreover we speak not of ceremonies, but 
          of that Law which gives commandment concerning the movements of the 
          heart, namely the Decalogue. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because, indeed, 
          faith brings the Holy Ghost, and produces in hearts a new life, it is 
          necessary that it should produce spiritual movement in hearts. And what 
          these movements are, the prophet Jer. 31, 33 shows, when he says: 'I 
          will put My Law into their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.' 
          Therefore, when we have been justified by faith and regenerated, we 
          begin to fear and love God, to pray to Him, to expect from Him aid, 
          to give thanks and praise Him, and to obey Him in afflictions. We begin 
          also to love our neighbors, because our hearts have spiritual and holy 
          movements [there is now, through the Spirit of Christ a new heart, mind, 
          and spirit within]. &#8220;&mdash;<em> Book of Concord</em>, p.42.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <em>Formula of Concord</em> 
        well says:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For the Law 
          says indeed that it is God's will and command that we should walk in 
          a new life, but it does not give the power and ability to begin and 
          do it; but the Holy Ghost, who is given and received, not through the 
          Law, but through the preaching of the gospel, Gal. 3:14, renews the 
          heart. Thereafter the Holy Ghost employs the Law so to teach the regenerate 
          from it, and to point out and show them in the Ten Commandments what 
          is the [good and] acceptable will of God, Rom. 12:2, in what good works 
          God hath before ordained that they should walk, Eph. 2, 10.&quot; &mdash;<em> 
          Ibid</em>., p.262.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And yet we must always remember 
        that mortal man can never reach a point in the Spirit-filled life where 
        his fellowship with God does not rest entirely on justification by the 
        blood of Christ.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John the apostle says, &quot;Beloved, 
        believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: 
        because many false prophets are gone out into the world.&quot; 1 John 
        4:1. How shall we try the spirits? Isaiah declares, &quot;To the law and 
        to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because 
        there is no light in them.&quot; Isa. 8:20; cf. v.16. That is to say, 
        we must try them by the law and the gospel.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the &quot;fire &#8230;from 
        heaven&quot; deceives multitudes with sensational wonders (Rev. 13:13), 
        God will have a people whose faith and experience meet the two-fold test 
        of the law and the gospel. Says the revelator:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And I saw 
          another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel 
          to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and 
          kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, 
          and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship 
          Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters 
          . . . Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the 
          commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And I looked, 
          and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud One sat like unto the Son 
          of man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle. 
          And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to 
          Him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in Thy sickle, and reap: for the time 
          is come for Thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.&quot;
