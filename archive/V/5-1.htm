<font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the armies of Napoleon 
        began to overrun the historic European boundaries, William Pitt stood 
        up in the British parliament and cried, &quot;Roll up the map of Europe. 
        It will not be wanted for ten years.&quot;</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The charismatic 
        movement is on an unprecedented rampage through the churches of the United 
        States. It is crossing all denominational boundary lines, even blurring 
        the distinction between Catholic and Protestant. Roll up the historical 
        denominational distinctions. There is going to be a regrouping along new 
        religious boundary lines.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The charismatic movement (which 
        embraces Pentecostalism, neo-Pentecostalism, the Jesus movement and most 
        American revivalism) is not a passing fad. The editors and publishers 
        of this magazine believe that it is a definite fulfillment of Bible prophecy 
        (Rev. 13:13-14); and, without rashness or rancor, we must candidly state 
        our convictions that it is destined to sweep the whole world into the 
        delusive frenzy of an anti-gospel religious excitement.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also want to make clear 
        our position that many good Christian people are involved in different 
        phases of the charismatic movement. They do not see that it is leading 
        back to the religious philosophy of the medieval church and the Dark Ages, 
        or that it is absolutely inimical to every eternal principle of the Protestant 
        Reformation. We hope that many of these sincere people will read this 
        magazine. To them we make the appeal, &quot;Come, let us reason together.&quot; 
        No one can confront the realities of the everlasting gospel and remain 
        a part of the modern charismatic movement. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Churches and religious leaders 
        are deeply divided over the Pentecostal issue. In the last two months, 
        this editor has received volumes of mail from Protestant ministers. Some 
        Lutheran ministers are ashamed of their Protestant heritage, and they 
        feel that the charismatic movement is the true Reformation in contrast 
        to the one of the sixteenth century. Other Lutheran ministers are enthusiastically 
        behind our efforts to restore the primacy, supremacy and all-sufficiency 
        of the Reformation doctrine of righteousness by faith. Some Methodist 
        clergymen are wholly for ecumenism, for the charismatic movement and for 
        burying the great religious issues of the past, while other Methodist 
        ministers praise God for a voice to uphold the objective gospel. And there 
        are Baptists for and Baptists against the charismatic movement. We agree 
        with one minister who wrote to us, exclaiming, &quot;American Protestantism 
        is drowning in a sea of religious subjectivism!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many descendants of the Reformation 
        now feel guilty about the use of the word <em>Protestant</em>. It has become a 
        dirty word. Was Paul Tillich right when, about twenty years ago, he observed 
        that the Protestant era had come to an end? During the summer of 1972, 
        while in the U.S., we made out a simple five-point questionnaire which 
        dealt with the most basic issues between the medieval church and the Reformation. 
        Sample pollings showed that ninety-five per cent of the &quot;Jesus People&quot; 
        were decidedly medieval and anti-Reformation in their thinking. And among 
        churchgoing Protestants the ratings were nearly as high.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We could not state the situation 
        better than the words of a Lutheran pastor who wrote to us, saying, &quot;I 
        believe that the last times are marked by the opportunity to hear the 
        Word as never before, paralleled by the deception of Satan which causes 
        men, in the clear light of noonday, to be more blind, stupid and unbelieving 
        than ever before.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this special issue 
        of <em>Present Truth Magazine</em>, we have documented the material presented 
        in seminar by this editor. We trust that the written presentation will 
        bring forth the same earnest and enthusiastic response that was given 
        the oral presentations.</font></p>
