      <FONT SIZE="6" FACE="Arial Black" COLOR="Maroon">Protestant Revivalism, 
      Pentecostalism and the Drift Back to Rome</FONT><font size="6" face="Arial Black">&nbsp;</font>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="5-5.gif" alt="Everyone to Rome" width=416 height=355 border=0 align="right">The sixteenth century rediscovery of Paul's objective message of justification by faith invaded the consciousness of men with a tempestuous fury and changed the course of history. The Protestant movement was founded upon a restoration of the primacy, supremacy and all-sufficiency of justification by faith.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No one would want to contend that the Protestant Reformation completely recovered the purity of faith which existed in the apostolic church. The Reformers did not always agree among themselves. They were not always consistent in every area. And it was inevitable that the church did not all at once abandon every error of the Dark Ages. But in spite of differences and inconsistencies, the Reformers were absolutely united on justification by faith &mdash; its objective meaning and its absolute centrality in the Christian faith.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have already observed that there is a tendency in human nature to gravitate from the objective stance of the gospel to religious subjectivism, to shift the central focus from Christ's experience to Christian experience. This is what happened in the great &quot;falling away&quot; in the early church. And the same evolution has taken place within the Protestant movement.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Error 
        of the Sects</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even before the Reformers had 
        passed off the stage, different sects began to grow up within the Protestant 
        movement and to break from the founding churches. The sects said that 
        Luther made a good start in reviving the doctrine of justification by 
        faith, but they had the feeling that Luther stood only half way and that 
        they must go on, higher. These sects were generally not without some truth. 
        Often they emphasized something that was neglected by the founding churches 
        of the Reformation. But Luther discerned that they erred on the great 
        charter of Protestantism &#8211; justification by faith &#8211; and, as 
        far as he was concerned, if this was wrong everything was wrong. &quot;Whoever 
        departs from the article of justification does not know God and is an 
        idolater,&quot; wrote Luther. &quot;For when this article has been taken 
        away, nothing remains but error, hypocrisy, godlessness, and idolatry, 
        although it may seem to be the height of truth, worship of God, holiness, 
        etc.&quot; &mdash; <em>What Luther Says</em> (St. Louis, Mo.: Concordia Publishing 
        House, 1959), Vol.11, pp.702-704.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These sectarian teachers did 
        not deny justification as an <em>initiating</em> step in the Christian life. Their 
        error was the old one of relegating justification to something whereby 
        the believer can make a start and then go on to higher things. With them, 
        justification by faith was no longer the center. Their focus was away 
        from Christ's experience to their own, from the objective to the subjective. 
        Luther understood their mentality when he said:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For people 
          say, Why, this man can preach about nothing but baptism, the ten commandments, 
          the Lord's Prayer, and faith &#8211; matters which even the children 
          know nowadays. Why is it that he is forever dinning the same sermon 
          into our ears. Who cannot do this? One must not surely stay forever 
          with the same matter but continue and progress (say the sects). Dear 
          people, you have now heard the self same stuff for so long a time; you 
          must rise higher.&quot; &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>., Vol.III, p.1268.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the time of the Reformers, 
        the Munzerites and radical Anabaptists gave great prominence to the work 
        and gifts of the Spirit. Their cry was, &quot;The Spirit! the Spirit!&quot; 
        but Luther replied, &quot;I will not follow where their spirit leads.&quot; 
        They were the sixteenth century charismatics.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then there was Osiander. At 
        first a disciple and colaborer with Luther, he broke from the Reformation 
        teaching on justification by an imputed (outside) righteousness and began 
        to teach that the believer is justified by the indwelling of Christ and 
        His essential righteousness. Both Luther and Calvin recognized that Osiander's 
        teaching was a return, in principle, to the Roman Catholic idea of justification. 
        Some of the sects erred from the gospel in that they tried to go beyond 
        righteousness by faith to seeking a state of absolute sinlessness in this 
        mortal life on earth. The Reformers also recognized that this was actually 
        Roman Catholic perfectionism in new garments.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the time of the Reformers, 
        the Protestant movement went through the period known as <em>Protestant orthodoxy</em>. 
        Heresies were resisted by careful definition and redefinition of the Protestant 
        faith. Faith tended to become intellectualized; and although some good 
        theology was produced in this period, orthodoxy produced a sterile faith 
        and a dead church.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Germany, Pietism arose as 
        a reaction against the dead orthodoxy of the Lutheran Church. It cannot 
        be denied that many of the Pietist leaders were earnest, godly men; and 
        their witness did accomplish some good. But the definite tendency of Pietism 
        was to distort the objective gospel with an exaggerated emphasis on experience. 
        Much of the German Pietism recaptured the spirit of the great Catholic 
        mystics and resembled it in its sentimental (even effeminate) Christian 
        devotions.</font><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="Wesleyanism"></a>Wesleyanism</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="5-5c.gif" width="354" height="290" align="right"><img src="5-5b.gif" width="216" height="259" align="right">Eighteenth century England 
        witnessed a remarkable movement which was also a reaction to the dead 
        formalism of the Church of England. The truth of justification by faith 
        had been largely lost from the church. These were the days of the foxhunting 
        parsons who loved their dogs more than the flock. Moreover, there was 
        a growing working class, unchurched and untouched by an indifferent church. 
        John Wesley was probably the most outstanding man of the eighteenth century 
        in any country in the world. He was one of the most successful itinerant 
        evangelists since Paul. His effect on the whole national life of England 
        (especially on the working class) was so remarkable that some credit his 
        ministry with saving England from a revolution similar to that which engulfed 
        France.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Wesley believed in justification 
        by faith and taught it with power. His &quot;long suit,&quot; however, 
        was sanctification. He had been deeply influenced by Moravian Pietism 
        and certain of the great Catholic mystics. Wesley's emphasis on sanctification 
        was both the strength and weakness of the Methodist movement. It was the 
        strength of Methodism because such an emphasis was sorely needed. Among 
        many, the doctrine of imputed righteousness had become perverted with 
        antinomianism. Many were making the Reformation concept of imputed righteousness 
        an excuse for all sorts of ungodliness. Like a John the Baptist, Wesley 
        laid the ax at the root of the tree and called for fruit that was meet 
        for repentance. Along with justification by faith in the blood of Christ, Wesley 
        also emphasized repentance and the renewing power of the Holy Spirit in conforming lives to 
        true obedience to the law of God. Apart from sanctified obedience to the 
        law of God, Wesley declared that no soul would retain the blessing of 
        justification.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wesley's emphasis on sanctification 
        was also the weakness of Methodism. As Niebuhr has pointed out:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;. . . [Wesley's] 
          thought is rooted in the New Testament doctrine of forgiveness and justification. 
          However, he regards justification in essentially Augustinian terms, 
          as forgiveness for sins that are past; and he thinks of sanctification 
          as the higher stage of redemption.&quot; &mdash; Reinhold Niebuhr, <em>The 
          Nature and Destiny of Man</em> (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1949), 
          Vol.11, p.180.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wesley unfortunately developed a doctrine 
        of <em>entire</em> sanctification, known also as the &quot;second blessing&quot; 
        or &quot;Methodist perfection.&quot; He proposed that after justification 
        and a process of sanctification, the believer could receive by faith a 
        sudden second blessing which would completely purge the soul from inbred 
        sin  enabling the fully sanctified to feel nothing but perfect love. He 
        called this experience ''a still higher salvation,&quot; &quot;immensely 
        greater than that wrought when he was justified&quot; (<em>Plain Account</em>, 
        p. 7). Wesley and his preachers urged their hearers to seek this second 
        blessing of perfection with all diligence. They did, and gave proof of 
        it in lives of earnest (and sometimes frantic) piety.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With Paul and Luther, justification 
        by faith was the whole truth of the gospel. But in Wesleyanism, the centrality 
        and all-sufficiency of justification tended to be lost by being subordinated 
        to sanctification.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, it must be said to 
        the everlasting credit of John Wesley that, although he preached it to 
        others, till his dying day he frankly confessed he had not attained his 
        famous &quot;second blessing.&quot; He always sought it but only attained 
        to the hope of it. He was too humble and honest to confess anything but 
        that he still felt sin strong within him &mdash; although few men exhibited 
        the mastery over inbred sin as well as he did.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, not all of Wesley's 
        followers were as prudent or as humble as the great evangelist. The trouble 
        began when some of them did profess that they had attained the second 
        blessing of entire sanctification. A few were preachers, and some of these 
        soon fell to the temptation of imagining that they were superior to Wesley. 
        The great Methodist revival was therefore plagued and embarrassed by some 
        fanaticism. The problem did not come to the surface as long as all the 
        Methodists were <em>seeking</em> perfection. It boiled over when some claimed to 
        have <em>attained</em> it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This also must be said in Wesley's 
        favor: Most of his labors were directed in preaching the gospel to the 
        unsaved. Hence he was obliged to spend most of his time and energy preaching 
        justification by faith to sinners. This was a great providential blessing, 
        for it kept the evangelist in better balance. The same thing cannot be 
        said of all Wesley's spiritual children.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><img src="5-5d.gif" width="438" height="272" align="right">American Revivalism 
        and the Holiness Movement</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eighteenth and early nineteenth 
        century American Protestantism became heir of much of Methodism's religious 
        fervor. America developed its own style and brand of revivalism. It suited 
        the national temper and was unconsciously molded by the frontier spirit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Frontier life was rude, raw 
        and exciting. Some of the frontier people saw very little of churches 
        or preachers except once a year at a big tent revival meeting. As the 
        growing calves were rounded up once a year for branding, so the growing 
        youth needed to be gathered in and &quot;saved,&quot; while the older 
        people felt their need for a good &quot;clean-up&quot; in the yearly revival 
        time. As Vinson Synan has well said:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Those who 
          attended such camp meetings...generally expected their religious experiences 
          to be as vivid as the frontier life around them. Accustomed to 'braining 
          bears and battling Indians,' they received their religion with great 
          color and excitement.&quot; &mdash; Vinson Synan, <em>The Holiness-Pentecostal 
          Movement in the United States</em> (Grand Rapids, Mich., Wm B Eerdmans' 
          Publishing Co., 1971), p.25. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes the religious fervor 
        was accompanied by great emotional excesses such as &quot;godly hysteria,&quot; 
        falling, jerking, &quot;the holy laugh,&quot; barking like dogs and &quot;such 
        wild dances as David performed before the Ark of the Lord.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the nineteenth century, 
        Charles Finney was such a successful evangelist that, by 1850, revivalism 
        &mdash; Charles Finney style &mdash; became like the national religion of America. 
        Finney's <em>Systematic Theology</em> (still one of the most popular manuals 
        on theology in the Pentecostal churches today) is very critical of Luther 
        and Calvin with respect to their teaching of justification by faith through 
        an imputed righteousness. Finney's predominant emphasis is on sanctification 
        and God's work within human experience &#8211; an emphasis which is neither 
        Pauline nor Reformation. His preaching led people into a very emotional, 
        crisis experience, and a seeking after a holiness of experience that would 
        be acceptable to God.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In all these revival influences, 
        the predominant emphasis was to find God in a very dramatic, emotional, 
        empirical, inward experience of the heart. There was very little focus 
        on being acceptable to God by faith in an experience and a righteousness 
        not our own but outside of us in the person of Christ. American revivalism 
        was far more subjective than objective, far more experience-centered than 
        gospel-centered.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About the middle of the last 
        century, the Methodist Church (which was then the largest church in the 
        U.S.A.) experienced a remarkable resurgence of interest in the doctrine 
        of the &quot;second blessing.&quot; As Synan writes, &quot;The optimistic 
        idea that one could find perfection seemed to match the general optimism 
        that prevailed throughout American society.&quot; &mdash; <em>Ibid.,</em> p.22. 
        &quot;It was a kind of evangelical transcendentalism which thrived in 
        the idealism of a young and growing America.&quot; &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>., p.30. 
        &quot;The decade of the 1840's, therefore, witnessed a veritable flood 
        of perfectionistic teaching in the Methodist Church. Leading pastors, 
        bishops, and theologians led the movement, giving it institutional and 
        intellectual respectability.&quot; &mdash;<em>Ibid</em>., p.28.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This development spilled over 
        into other Protestant bodies, and by 1869 it became known as the &quot;holiness 
        movement.&quot; Independent &quot;holiness&quot; publications sprang up 
        all over the country. The movement spread to England and found expression 
        in the renowned Keswick Convention.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The emphasis that was popularized 
        in the holiness movement was concerning the victorious, Spirit-filled 
        life. Its focal point was not on justification or conversion but on the 
        attainment of an empirical experience of holiness and entire sanctification 
        subsequent to conversion. Boardman, Inskip, A. B. Simpson, Torrey, and 
        Andrew Murray were some of the best-known writers and leaders of the movement. 
        Hannah W. Smith's <em>The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life</em> (still 
        circulated today) expressed very well the aspirations of the holiness 
        people. Holiness-type books can generally be detected by titles that major 
        on experience rather than on the gospel (The Victorious Life, Keys to 
        Victorious Living, The Spirit-Filled Life, etc.). The punch line of these 
        books is generally on Romans 7 and Romans 8: &quot;Get out of Romans 7 
        into Romans 8&quot; (which, incidentally, is decidedly contrary to what 
        the Reformers all taught).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One could not disparage the 
        holiness contribution as all bad. But the objective nature and value of 
        justification and forgiveness cease to be the center of its thrust. They 
        are undervalued, even demeaned in the overwhelming preoccupation with 
        religious experience and perfectionism. The holiness movement goes aground 
        on the rocks of subjectivism, and because of this, it is basically more 
        in harmony with Roman Catholicism than with Protestantism.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the 1890's the Methodist 
        Church finally took an administrative stand against the holiness movement. 
        Consequently, between the years 1890 and 1900, twenty-three holiness denominations 
        were founded.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Pentecostal 
        Movement</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toward the end of the nineteenth 
        century, many within the holiness movement began to speak about and seek 
        for the &quot;baptism of fire.&#8221; One branch of the holiness movement 
        was called the &quot;Fire-Baptized Holiness Church&quot; (originating 
        in Iowa in 1895 and led by Benjamin Irwin). Those receiving &quot;the 
        fire&quot; would often shout, scream, fall in trances or speak in other 
        tongues. This &quot;baptism of fire&quot; was regarded as a miraculous 
        visitation of the Spirit that followed entire sanctification. The more 
        conservative teachers of the holiness movement rejected this &quot;third&quot; 
        blessing of fire, for they regarded the second blessing and the special 
        baptism of the Spirit as synonymous.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the radical &quot;fire&quot; 
        advocates continued to make an impact within the movement with fiery preaching 
        and publications like <em>Live Coals of Fire</em> (first published in 
        October, 1899). This paper spoke of &quot;the blood that cleans up, the 
        Holy Ghost that fills up, the fire that burns up, and the dynamite that 
        blows up.&quot; It is not hard to imagine the eccentric and mind-bending 
        manifestations that accompanied the blowing-up stage of this religious 
        high. The logical outcome of this religious trend was the appearance of 
        the twentieth-century Pentecostal movement, which generally traces its 
        beginnings to the ministry of Charles Parham at Topeka, Kansas in 1900. 
        Says Synan:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Pentecostal 
          movement arose as a split in the holiness movement and can be viewed 
          as the logical outcome of the holiness crusade which had vexed American 
          Protestantism for forty years . . . &quot;&mdash; Synan, <em>op. cit</em>., 
          p.115.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Frederick Dale Bruner also 
        says:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Out of the 
          world-wide holiness movements the Pentecostal movement was born. The 
          Pentecostal historian, Charles Conn, notes 'that the Pentecostal movement 
          is an extension of the holiness revival that occurred during the last 
          half of the nineteenth century.' &quot;&mdash; Frederick Dale Bruner, <em>A 
          Theology of the Holy Spirit</em> (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans 
          Publishing Co., 1970), p.44.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Says noted Catholic author 
        and contemporary ecumenist, Kilian McDonnell:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;John Wesley was father 
        to much of the 19th century American religious fervor; one of his children 
        was the Holiness Movement which gave rise to the Pentecostalism of the 
        20th century.&quot; &mdash; Kilian McDonnell, &quot;The Classical Pentecostal 
        Movement,&quot; <em>New Covenant</em>, Vol. I, No.11 (May, 1972), p.1. 
        (<em>New Covenant</em> is a monthly publication serving the Catholic charismatic 
        renewal.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Pentecostal movement came 
        into being directly on the issue of insisting that the physical sign of 
        speaking in tongues was the evidence of the baptism of the Spirit. This 
        issue of tongues caused a split between the holiness and Pentecostal movements; 
        yet the basic emphasis of the two movements remains the same. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pentecostalism is the inevitable 
        end of subjective revivalism. It is American revivalism in its final form 
        of development. The kind of revivals that operate in the United States 
        may not be overtly Pentecostal or charismatic, but they tend in that direction 
        because they are supremely orientated toward religious experientialism.</font></p>

        emphasis of the Reformation doctrine of justification by faith. It has 
        been a drift back to Romanism. A few years ago, noted Roman Catholic author, 
        Louis Bouyer, made these stunning observations:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Protestant 
          Revival . . . recalls the best and most authentic elements of the Catholic 
          tradition . . . &mdash; Louis Bouyer, <em>The Spirit and Forms of Protestantism</em> 
          (Cleveland, Ohio: World Publishing Co., 1964), p.186.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We see in 
          every Protestant country, Christians who owed their religion to the 
          movement we have called, in general, Revivalism, attain a more or less 
          complete rediscovery of Catholicism.&quot; &mdash; <em>Ibid.</em>, p. 188.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The contemporary 
          revivals most valuable and lasting in their results all present a striking 
          analogy with this process of rediscovery of Catholicism...&quot; &mdash;Ibid., 
          p.189. &quot;. . . the instinctive orientation of the revivals toward 
          the Catholic&#8230; would bring in that way a reconciliation between 
          the Protestant Movement and the Church&#8230; &quot;&mdash; <em>Ibid</em>., 
          p.197. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bouyer closes with an appeal 
        to his fellow Catholics to prepare for the inevitable return of the &quot;separated 
        brethren&quot; under the influence of contemporary revivals. The fact 
        that many revivalists regard themselves as anti-Catholic makes no difference, 
        for as Bouyer points out, they are simply in the dark about how the heart 
        of their emphasis is in profound harmony with Catholicism. If the reader 
        wants to know what Rome thinks about the most popular U.S. revivalists 
        today, he would be well advised to secure the July, 1972 issue of <em>The 
        Catholic Digest.</em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also a few years ago, Protestant 
        scholar Paul Tillich<sup>1</sup> observed that we have reached &quot;the end of the 
        Protestant era.&quot;</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For the kind 
          of Protestantism which has developed in America is not so much an expression 
          of the Reformation, but has more to do with the so-called Evangelical 
          Radicals. There are the Lutheran and Calvinistic groups, and they are 
          strong, but they have adapted themselves to an astonishing degree to 
          the climate of American Protestantism. This climate has not been made 
          by them, but by the sectarian movements. Thus when I came to America 
          twenty years ago, the theology of the Reformation was almost unknown 
          in Union Theological Seminary [New York] because of the different traditions, 
          and the reduction of the Protestant tradition nearer to the non-Reformation 
          traditions.&quot; &mdash; Paul Tillich, <em>A History of Christian Thought 
          </em>(London: S.C.M. Press, Ltd., 1968), pp.225-226. (From lectures 
          first given in 1953.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Luther's conflict 
          with the evangelical radicals is especially important for American Protestants 
          because the prevailing type of Christianity in America was not produced 
          by the Reformation directly, but by the indirect effect of the Reformation 
          through the movement of evangelical radicalism.&quot; &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>., 
          p.239.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last decade has more than 
        justified the observations of Bouyer and Tillich. The drift toward Rome 
        has become like that place in the Niagara River where the boatsman reaches 
        the point of no return as the water rushes on toward the falls. We must 
        now consider this development.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Neo-Pentecostal/Charismatic 
        Movement</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 1900 to 1960, the Pentecostal 
        movement continued to grow outside the mainstream of Protestantism. Yet 
        by 1960 it had attained a world-wide membership of about eight million. 
        At that time, men like Dr. Henry Van Dusen began to call the movement 
        the &quot;third force&quot; in Christendom.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then about 1960 a remarkable 
        change took place. Pentecostalism began to jump the denominational boundary 
        lines and to penetrate the mainline Protestant churches. As John Sherrill 
        says in his book, <em>They Speak With Other Tongues</em>, &quot;the walls 
        came tumbling down.&quot; Soon there were thousands, and then millions, 
        of Episcopalian, Methodist, Lutheran, Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist 
        and other Protestant Pentecostals. This interdenominational phase of the 
        movement became known as the neo-Pentecostal, or charismatic, movement. 
        It was no longer a separate denomination but an experience that transcended 
        all denominational boundary lines. Those sharing the experience in different 
        denominations saw themselves as having more in common with each other 
        than with non-charismatics of the same church. Many confidently predicted 
        that this was the beginning of the greatest revival the world had ever 
        known.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toward the end of the decade, 
        the neo-Pentecostal movement made two further astounding strides. It entered 
        the new youth culture and became known as the Jesus movement. (It is estimated 
        that ninety per cent of the Jesus People, as they are called, have some 
        form of Pentecostal experience.) Many from the drug culture became &quot;high&quot; 
        on Jesus instead of drugs. Then, to crown its success, the neo-Pentecostal 
        movement entered the Catholic Church in 1967. After a modest beginning 
        in its great centers of learning (Duquesne and Notre Dame), it is now 
        spreading rapidly in the Catholic Church, attracting the support of cardinals, 
        bishops and thousands of priests and nuns. <br>
        Since Roman Catholics are now receiving the identical Pentecostal experience 
        as Protestants, the old-line Pentecostals are having to re-evaluate their 
        attitude to Roman Catholicism. Traditionally anti-papal, the classical 
        Pentecostal churches are changing their stance since &quot;Pentecost&quot; 
        has come to Rome.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although Pentecostalism was 
        introduced to the Catholic Church initially by Protestant Pentecostals, 
        it is meeting even less resistance in Catholic circles than in Protestant 
        circles. In fact, as many Catholic authors are pointing out, Pentecostalism 
        is more at home in the ancient church. It is more at home there because 
        the overwhelming Pentecostal emphasis on the subjective experience is 
        in essential harmony with the tradition of the Roman Church. Says Benedictine 
        monk, Father Edward O'Connor of Notre Dame:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Although they 
          derive from Protestant backgrounds, the Pentecostal churches are not 
          typically Protestant in their beliefs, attitudes or practices.&quot; 
          &mdash; Edward O'Connor, <em>The Pentecostal Movement in the Catholic Church 
          </em>(Notre Dame, Ind.: Ave Maria Press, 1971), p.23.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;. . . it cannot 
          be assumed that the Pentecostal movement represents an incursion of 
          Protestant influence.&quot; &mdash;<em> Ibid., </em>p.32.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;&#8230;Catholics 
          who have accepted Pentecostal spirituality have found it to be fully 
          in harmony with their traditional faith and life. They experience it, 
          not as a borrowing from an alien religion, but as a connatural development 
          of their own.&quot; &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>., p.28. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;&#8230;the 
          spiritual experience of those who have been touched by the grace of 
          the Holy Spirit in the Pentecostal movement is in profound harmony with 
          the classical spiritual theology of the Church.&quot; &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>., 
          p.183.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;&#8230;the 
          experience of the Pentecostal movement tends to confirm the validity 
          and relevance of our authentic spiritual traditions.&quot; &mdash;<em>Ibid.</em>, 
          p.191.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Moreover, 
          the doctrine that is developing in the Pentecostal churches today seems 
          to be going through stages very similar to those which occurred in the 
          early Middle Ages when the classical doctrine was taking shape.&quot; 
          &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>., pp.193-194.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, neo-Pentecostalism 
        certainly does nothing to unsettle the faith of Catholics in their church 
        and traditions. Says Father O'Connor:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Similarly, 
          the traditional devotions of the Church have taken on more meaning. 
          Some people have been brought back to a frequent use of the sacrament 
          of Penance through the experience of the baptism in the Spirit. Others 
          have discovered a place for devotion to Mary in their lives, whereas 
          previously they had been indifferent or even antipathetic toward her. 
          One of the most striking effects of the Holy Spirit's action has been 
          to stir up devotion to the Real Presence in the Eucharist.&quot; &mdash; Edward 
          O'Connor,<em> Pentecost in the Catholic Church</em> (Pecos, N.M.: Dove 
          Publications, 1970), pp.14-15.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Ecumenical 
        Phase of Pentecostalism</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 1970's have brought us 
        to a great ecumenical phase of revivalism and the charismatic movement. 
        Says <em>Christianity Today</em> of February 1, 1972:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The force 
          that appears to be making the greatest contribution to the current Christian 
          revival around the globe is Pentecostalism. This movement, which began 
          several decades ago, and which in its early years was very sectarian 
          in character, is now becoming ecumenical in the deepest sense. A neo-Pentecostalism 
          has lately appeared that includes many thousands of Roman Catholics 
          . . . A new era of the Spirit has begun. The charismatic experience 
          moves Christians far beyond glossolalia&#8230;.There is light on the 
          horizon. An evangelical renaissance is becoming visible along the Christian 
          highway from the frontiers of the sects to the high places of the Roman 
          Catholic' communion. This appears to be one of the most strategic moments 
          in the Church's history.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The May, 1972 issue of <em>New 
        Covenant</em> (Catholic charismatic publication) features Catholics and 
        Protestants uniting in a great charismatic fellowship. It proclaims that 
        the charismatic movement holds the hope of healing the wound of the sixteenth 
        century. Dr. Henry Pitney Van Dusen (Union Theological Seminary) is featured 
        as saying:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The presence 
          of the charismatic (Pentecostal) movement among us is said to make a

          appear to future historians as a 'true reformation' (compared to that 
          of the 16th century) from which will spring a third force in the Christian 
          world (Protestant-Catholic-Pentecostal).&quot; &mdash; Henry Pitney Van Dusen, 
          New Covenant, <em>op. cit</em>., p.19.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="5-5e.gif" width="600" height="150" align="right">This union is not based on 
        objective truth but on subjective experience. American Christianity is 
        drowning in a sea of religious subjectivism. Charismatic literature (and 
        with it we include all this subjective revivalism) is infesting the land 
        like <strong>the frogs of Egypt</strong> (see Rev. 16:13-14). Never has such a mass of 
        literature been so devoid of the gospel of Christ. There is scarcely one 
        extrinsic, objective thought in it. It is all &quot;in and in and in&quot;; 
        a return to sentimental, effeminate, medieval mysticism. No wonder one 
        of the points of dialogue between Pentecostal leaders and the Roman Catholic 
        Church (a dialogue which is now in progress in Rome) is the remarkable 
        similarity between Pentecostalism and Catholic mysticism. The startling 
        fact of the crumbling of Protestant resistance to Pentecostalism illustrates 
        the decadence of the Protestant churches. Even the word Protestant is 
        becoming a dirty word.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>A Fulfillment 
        of Prophecy</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Multitudes are exulting that 
        the church is being stirred by the fires of revivalism. This is not a 
        passing fad but a remarkable fulfillment of Bible prophecy. If the Protestant 
        movement had not cast away the historical system of prophetic interpretation 
        (which was espoused by the Reformers) in favor of futurism and preterism 
        (developed by the Jesuits),<sup>2</sup> it might have escaped the delusion of these 
        last days.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Protestants once generally 
        accepted the fact that the two-horned lamb-like beast of Revelation 13 
        was a symbol of the papacy. Armed with the objective truth of justification 
        by faith, the Reformation broke the stranglehold of papal thought and 
        set the nations free from papal domination. But the modern Pentecostal 
        movement represents a restoration of the ancient Roman church&#8217;s 
        power to dominate the minds and enslave the consciences of men. The prophet 
        declares:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And he doeth 
          great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth 
          in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the 
          means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the 
          beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make 
          an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.&quot; 
          Rev. 13:13-14.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Fire . . . from heaven... 
        in the sight of men&quot; is an astoundingly accurate picture of American 
        Protestantism caught up in the fires of false revivalism and Pentecostalism. 
        Fire is the favorite symbol of the charismatic movement &#8212; and it 
        is the symbol God uses to describe that movement because it is a counterfeit 
        outpouring of the Holy Spirit. It is not really fire from heaven, but 
        it appears to be fire from heaven. It is &quot;fire&#8230;.from heaven&#8230;in 
        the sight of men.&quot; But by its influence it will cause &quot;the earth 
        and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly 
        wound was healed&quot; (Rev. 13:12).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last days are to be marked 
        by great religious deceptions. Working in the guise of &quot;fire &#8230;from 
        heaven&quot; (the pseudo-baptism of the Holy Spirit), &quot;the spirits 
        of devils&quot; will &quot;go forth unto the kings of the earth and of 
        the whole world, to gather them to the battle of the great day of God 
        Almighty&quot; (Rev. 16:14; see also 2 Thess. 2:8-12).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Already it is considered as 
        blasphemy to speak against the supernatural workings within the new Pentecostal 
        movement. A spirit of boastful certainty and arrogant intolerance has 
        often been manifested by those who &quot;have the Spirit.&quot; The preoccupation 
        with inward experience is leading multitudes back to the religious philosophy 
        of the medieval church. Rome knows the score. She reads what is to be. 
        Some well-meaning men seem to be as paralyzed as Mellanchthon was when 
        he did not know whether or not to speak out against the spiritualistic 
        enthusiasts who came to Wittenberg while Luther was hidden in the Wartburg 
        Castle. It was this issue that led the great Reformer to come out of hiding 
        and to risk his life. Cried the &#8220;Spirit-filled&#8221; leaders on 
        being granted an interview with Luther, &quot;The Spirit! the Spirit!&quot; 
        The Reformer was decidedly unimpressed, &quot;I slap your spirit on the 
        snout,&quot; he thundered. He saw that the great truth of justification 
        by faith was diametrically opposed to these &quot;German prophets,&quot; 
        as he styled them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have now come to the time 
        when the great issues of the sixteenth century have to be fought out again. 
        This time the conflict will be more severe, and it will be final. Roll 
        up the old denominational boundary lines. There is going to be a regrouping 
        of the religious world. On the one side there will be a grand union of 
        Catholics, pseudo-Protestants, and Pentecostals in what appears to be 
        a movement for the conversion of the whole world. This movement is described 
        in Revelation 13. On the other side there will be a movement to restore 
        the everlasting gospel in its pristine purity and power. This movement 
        is described in Revelation 14. In our concluding study we must consider 
        the features of God's final message.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
