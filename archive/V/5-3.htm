          by Faith<br>
          and the Baptism of the Spirit</FONT><br> &nbsp;<BR> <P><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
            we consider the message of Saint Paul, one word stands out &#8212; 
            <em>justification</em>. His letter to the Romans is the great 
            beacon light on the doctrine of justification.</font>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The words <em>justify</em> 
            and <em>justification</em> are legal words, closely related to the 
            idea of a court trial and judgment. Justification with God implies 
            that one has stood before the divine court and has been forgiven and declared just, 
            or righteous.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Being a legal 
            word,<em> justification </em>is also closely related to <em>law</em>. 
            The divine court has a holy, just and good law (Rom. 7:12) which must 
            be reckoned with in the matter of justification. At the outset of 
            his epistle, the apostle declares,&quot; . . . the doers of the law 
            shall be justified.&quot; Rom. 2:13. The law demands perfect obedience, 
            and unless this demand is met, no man will ever be justified.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The human predicament, 
            however, is that absolutely no man can render an obedience that will 
            satisfy the law. &quot;Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall 
            no flesh be justified in His sight: for by the law is the knowledge 
            of sin.&quot; Rom. 3:20. Let a man climb the alpine heights of holy 
            living, and the law will say, &quot;Not good enough.&quot; A man might 
            just as well reach up and touch the stars as satisfy the law with 
            his obedience. Not only is it true that &quot;all have sinned,&quot; 
            but all &quot;continue to come short <sup>1</sup> of the glory of God&quot; (Rom. 
            3:23).</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus does Paul 
            use the law to level all men and show that a man has to look outside 
            of his own experience for justification.</font></p>
          <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Three 
            Objective Aspects of Justification</strong></font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The justification 
            and forgiveness of sinners is the redemptive work of  God (Rom. 8:33). Just as God has revealed Himself to us in His word as God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, so there are three aspects to God's 
            way of declaring men righteous. It is said to be:</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>By grace</strong> 
              &mdash; (the Father) <br>
              <strong>By Christ</strong> &mdash; (the Son) <br>
              <strong>By faith</strong> &mdash; (the Spirit). </font></p> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Being 
              justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in 
              Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through 
              faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission 
              of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.&quot; Rom. 
              3:24-25.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>By Grace. 
            </strong>Grace in this context is not a quality <em>infused</em> into man but 
            is simply God's attitude of favor and mercy toward undeserving sinners. 
            Justifying grace is qualified by the word <em>freely</em>, which is elsewhere 
            translated &quot;without a cause.&quot; Grace therefore is unearned 
            and unmerited. The sinner must not look for it in his own heart but 
            only in the heart of God. Grace means to be accepted in spite of being 
            unacceptable.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>By Christ. 
            </strong>Justification is said to be &quot;by Christ&quot; (Gal. 2:17), 
            or &quot;by the obedience of One&quot; (Rom. 5:19). We have seen that 
            the law demands perfect obedience. This the sinner owes to the law, 
            but he is incapable of rendering it. Christ became the sinner's Substitute. 
            By His doing and dying (His sinless life and atoning death) He satisfied the demands of a righteous law 
            in the sinner's name. Salvation comes through perfect obedience to 
            the law of Jehovah &#8211; not ours but His. Men are saved by good 
            works &#8212; not theirs but His.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justification 
            by Christ means that repentant believers are accepted before God by means of a substitute 
            life. We are accounted righteous because Jesus is righteous. We are 
            pleasing in the sight of a holy God because Jesus is pleasing.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>By Faith. </strong>Repentance towards God and faith in the blood of Christ are created in the sinner's heart by the mighty working of the 
            third Person of the Godhead. When the gospel is proclaimed, the Spirit 
            persuades the sinner that it is true, and creates in his heart both 
            the desire to repent and the willingness to accept the salvation which is in 
            Jesus.</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Acts 20:20-21  I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,  21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Acts 2:21   21 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John 12:31-33 1 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. 32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. 33 This he said, signifying what death he should die. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John 15:26 26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me: </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John 16:7-8 7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. 8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John 16:13 13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come. </font></p>
          </blockquote>                    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no saving 
            merit in faith, but faith brings to God the obedience of Jesus Christ, 
            and the Lord places the obedience of His Son to the repentant sinner's account. 
            This is how faith is counted (reckoned or imputed) as righteousness 
            (see Rom. 4:5-6, 9-10, 21-25).</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justification 
            with God comes by an <em>imputed</em> righteousness. The word 
            <em>impute</em> is very different from the word infuse. Imputed righteousness 
            means that this righteousness is outside of the believer, in the person 
            of Jesus Christ. It is, as Luther said, an <em>alien, 
            foreign</em>, and <em>extrinsic</em> righteousness. 
            It is not on earth but<em> in heaven</em>. Justification therefore is God's 
            verdict of righteousness upon the fallen repentant sinner for the sake of Christ 
            in whom the sinner believes. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christ's sinless life and atoning death are a <em>finished</em> work that God <em>has done</em> for man, and 
              must not be confused with what He does <em>within</em> man. As John Bunyan 
              said, &quot;That man will be at a loss that looketh for a righteousness 
              in himself, when it is to be found nowhere but in Jesus Christ.&quot; .....&quot;Indeed this is one of the greatest mysteries in the world &#8211; 
              namely, that a righteousness that resides with a person in heaven 
              should justify me, a sinner, on earth.&quot; &mdash; John Bunyan, <em>Justification 
              by an Imputed Righteousness</em> (Swengel, Penn.: Reiner Publications, 
              1967).</font></p>          
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, the grace 
            which justifies is outside of us, the doing and dying of Christ which 
            justifies us is outside of us, and the righteousness  which is by faith is that righteousness which is outside of us and which 
            justifies. There is no room for sentimental subjectivism in Paul's 
            doctrine of justification by faith.</font></p>
          <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The All-Sufficiency 
            of God's Justification</strong></font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The life which 
            Jesus lived for us and in our name was equal to the broadest demands 
            of an infinite law. In Him was &quot;all the fullness of the Godhead 
            bodily&quot; (Col. 2:9) &#8211; a life of infinite perfection, a life 
            superior to sinless Adam or highest angel. Christ's righteousness 
            was the very righteousness of God (2 Cor. 5:21), and all this and 
            nothing less than this is imputed to the believing sinner. The &quot;righteousness 
            of God&quot; Himself (Rom. 3:21-22), in all its infinite plenitude 
            and immeasurable totality, is ascribed to the believer in Jesus. God 
            does not impute His righteousness in degrees but gives it all &#8211; 
            all the accumulated wealth of eternity, all the virtue of Jesus Christ. 
            The gift of justification is an exceeding and eternal weight of glory. 
            It cannot be infused into mortal man; it cannot be reduced to an intra-human 
            experience. But this unspeakable inheritance is put to the believer's 
            credit in the bank of heaven. In the sight of God and in the verdict 
            of the supreme Judge of the universe, the believing forgiven sinner is righteous 
            &#8211; as righteous as Jesus Himself. He is faultless, blameless 
            and perfect (Col. 1:20-22; 2:10; Heb. 10:14). He stands as one who 
            has perfectly fulfilled the law of God and as one who is in harmony 
            with all its righteous precepts (Rom. 10:4). The repentant believing sinner has rest for his troubled conscience and assurance before God as  he trusts and continues to trust <em>only</em> in the blood of Christ for his forgiveness and acceptance with God and the free gift of eternal life. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God is not playing 
            make believe in this matter of imputed righteousness. Christ took 
            humanity unto Himself. The believer's real life is <em>in Christ</em> (Col. 
            3:3-4), and that life is pure and sinless &mdash; indeed, it is the very 
            righteousness of God (2 Cor. 5:21). Furthermore, faith unites the 
            sinner to Jesus. By faith he is &quot;married to Another, even to 
            Him who is raised from the dead&quot; (Rom. 7:4).</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Luther said 
            in one of his great passages: </font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Faith 
              . . . unites the soul with Christ, like a bride with the bridegroom, 
              and from this marriage, Christ and the soul become one body, as 
              St. Paul says (Eph. 5:30). Then the possessions of both are in common, 
              whether fortune, misfortune, or anything else; so that what Christ 
              has, also belongs to the believing soul, and what the soul has, 
              will belong to Christ. If Christ has all good things, including 
              blessedness, these will also belong to the soul. If the soul is 
              full of trespasses and sins, these will belong to Christ. At this 
              point a contest of happy exchanges takes place. Because Christ 
              is God and man, and has never sinned, and because His sanctity is 
              unconquerable, eternal, and almighty, He takes possession of the 
              sins of the believing soul by virtue of her wedding ring, namely 
              faith, and acts just as if He had committed those sins Himself. 
              They are, of course, swallowed up and drowned in Him, for His unconquerable 
              righteousness is stronger than any sin whatever. Thus the soul is 
              cleansed from all her sins by virtue of her dowry, i.e., for the 
              sake of her faith. She is made free and unfettered, and endowed 
              with the eternal righteousness of Christ, her bridegroom. Is not 
              that a happy household, when Christ, the rich, noble, and good bridegroom, 
              takes the poor, despised, wicked little harlot in marriage, sets 
              her free from all evil, and decks her with all good things? It is 
              not possible for her sins to damn her, for now they rest on Christ 
              and are swallowed up in Him. In this way she has such a rich righteousness 
              in her bridegroom that she can always withstand sins, though they 
              indeed lie in Wait for her.&quot; &mdash; B.L. Woolf, <em>Reformation 
              Writings of Martin Luther</em> (London: Lutherworth Press, 1952), 
              Vol. I, pp. 363-364.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This beautifully 
            illustrates how the sinner may be righteous through faith; and whoever 
            has this faith is righteous &#8211; fully and completely. He is ready 
            for anything &#8211; life, death, judgment, Christ's coming, the day

            of the Holy Spirit</strong></font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having viewed 
            the greatness and all-sufficiency of God's act of justifying the sinner, 
            we should be ready to answer the question, &quot;Does God's verdict 
            of righteousness upon the fallen sinner qualify him to receive the 
            baptism, or infilling, of the Holy Spirit?&quot; Of course! The justified 
            forgiven sinner stands before God, not only as if he had never sinned, but 
            as righteous as Jesus Himself. Is not Jesus righteous enough to receive 
            the baptism of the Holy Ghost? And we may ask, If God's act of justification 
            does not qualify the believer to receive the infilling of the Spirit, 
            what else will?</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The doctrine of 
            Paul is that the Holy Spirit fills <em>every</em> soul who is justified by 
            faith in the doing and dying of Christ, and fills that soul immediately upon his justification:</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Being 
              justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus 
              Christ . . . the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the 
              Holy Ghost which is given unto us.&quot; Rom. 5:1, 5.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the Galatians 
            Paul declared:</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Christ 
              hath redeemed us from the curse of the law.. .. that the blessing

              Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through 
              faith.&quot; Gal. 3:13-14.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Faith in the gospel 
            not only justifies sinner, but brings to the justified believer the measureless 
            gift of the Holy Spirit as soon as he believes. Paul challenged the 
            Galatians, &quot;Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or 
            by the hearing of faith?&quot; Gal. 3:2. And to the Ephesians he wrote,&quot; 
            . . . after that ye believed [or literally, having believed), ye were 
            sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise . . . &quot; Eph. 1:13. This 
            agrees with the words of Jesus, &quot;He that believeth on Me, as 
            the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living 
            water.&#8221;(But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that believe 
            on Him should receive. . .) John 7:38-39. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the book of 
            Romans Paul deals very specially with two gifts: 1.) the gift of justificatiion and the forgivenss of sin 
            (Rom. 5:17) and 2.) the gift of the Spirit (Rom. 5:5; Rom. 8). The gift 
            of righteousness is <em>imputed</em> (reckoned) for our forgivenss and justification; 
            the gift of the Spirit is <em>imparted</em> (infused) for 
            our renewal and sanctification.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <em>imputed</em> gift 
            of righteousness and the <em>imparted</em> gift of the Spirit must not be <em>confused,</em>            but must be properly distinguished. Justification is what God does 
            <em>for us</em>; the infilling of the Spirit is what He does <em>in 
            us</em>. Our renewal in the Spirit is not the meritorious cause of our justification 
            in whole or in part. Justification is by <em>imputed</em> righteousness <em>alone</em>            &#8211; that is, it rests on something completely without us, namely the sinless life and atoning death of Christ. Renewal 
            and sanctification of the Spirit are the <em>fruit</em> of justification (see 
            Rom. 5:1-5).</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While we must 
            be careful not to confuse God's work for us (justification) and God's 
            work in us (the infilling of the Spirit), we must be equally careful 
            not to <em>divorce</em> one phase of His work from the other. His work for 
            us (justification and forgiveness) brings the gift and infilling of the Spirit. Indeed, 
            this gift of the Spirit is the seal, pledge and guarantee that we 
            have been justified (Eph. 1:13-14; Rom. 8:14-16). Consequently, where 
            there is no renewal by the transforming power of the Spirit, no fruit 
            of the Spirit, it is certain that justification has never taken place. Repentance involves both sorrow for sin and a turning away from willful, high-handed dissobedience to the Law of God. The Law of God begins to be written in the heart of the believing repenting sinner. </font></p>
          <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Gift 
            of the Holy Spirit in the Book of Acts</strong></font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The book of Acts 
            amply illustrates what Paul teaches &#8211; namely, that the acceptance 
            of Christ for our justification brings the gift of the Holy Spirit. The book of Acts begins with Jesus' command to His apostles and small 
            band of followers:</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;&#8230;and, 
              being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should 
              not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, 
              which, saith He, ye have heard of Me. For John truly baptized with 
              water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days 
              hence.&quot; Acts 1:4-5.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus commanded 
            His disciples to &quot;wait&quot; for the baptism of the Spirit. Waiting 
            is hardly the posture of heroes, but it does accentuate the truth 
            that the Spirit is <em>given</em>, not <em>obtained</em>. Jesus did not say, &quot;Pray 
            for the promise of the Father.&quot; Doubtless the disciples did pray, 
            but the accent is on <em>waiting</em>, because the Spirit, being a promise 
            and a gift, does not come upon men as a result of their activity.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then the next 
            chapter of Acts continues:</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And when 
              the day of Pentecost was fully come, they <sup>2</sup> were all with one accord 
              in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of 
              a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were 
              sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of 
              fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with 
              the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit 
              gave them utterance.&quot; <br>
              Acts 2:1-4.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Luke wanted 
            to emphasize that prayer or some other activity brought down the Holy 
            Spirit, he missed a wonderful opportunity. The scripture does not 
            say that the 120 were praying when the Spirit fell, but that &quot;they 
            were sitting.&quot; There appears to be a definite effort to play 
            down any great activity on the part of the disciples in connection 
            with the baptism of the Spirit.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The crowd gathered, 
            and finally Peter stood up to preach that great Pentecostal message. 
            In explaining the gift of the Holy Spirit, he did not say, &quot;This 
            Spirit has been poured out upon us because we have waited for it, 
            and for many days we have prayed earnestly for it.&quot; Never! Peter 
            made no reference to his activities. Here is what he said:</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This Jesus 
              hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore being 
              by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father 
              the promise of the Holy Ghost, He hath shed forth this, which ye 
              now see and hear.&quot; Acts 2:32-33.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Spirit was 
            given because of Christ's <em>atonement</em>, not the believer's <em>attainment</em>. 
            He destroyed sin, conquered death and removed every barrier that kept 
            the Holy Spirit from His people. At Christ's ascension into heaven He was glorified in the presence 
            of the Father, exalted far above principalities and powers with glory impossible 
            to describe. But in His exaltation He could not forget His toiling, 
            struggling ones on earth. He longed to share His glory with those 
            who believed on Him. Pentecost was Christ <em>sharing</em> His glory &#8211; 
            all that mortal beings could endure &#8211; with His disciples. It 
            was a gift, the fulfillment of a promise, and came upon the fledgling 
            church solely because Jesus was glorified.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At Pentecost the 
            gospel was preached under the demonstration and power of the Spirit. 
            Like arrows from the Almighty, the truth went home to the hearts of 
            the hearers. They cried out, &quot;Men and brethren, what shall we 
            do?&quot;</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Then Peter 
              said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the 
              name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive 
              the gift of the Holy Ghost. &#8230;Then they that gladly received 
              his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them 
              about three thousand souls.&quot; Acts 2:38, 41.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now it is imperative 
            that we understand how the 3,000 souls received the Holy Spirit. They 
            were not told to wait. The disciples had waited. But after Pentecost 
            there is no command or suggestion that believers should wait for the 
            Spirit. The Spirit had come upon the church in a once-and-for-all 
            event. Peter did not tell his hearers, &quot;First you be baptized 
            for the forgiveness of sins. After that you must wait for the Spirit 
            like we did.&quot; No! Since Pentecost, the message of the gospel 
            is <em>believe</em> and <em>receive</em>. All who believe receive the Spirit. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not only did the 
            3,000 have no need to wait, but there is no suggestion that the Spirit 
            came upon them with a sound of wind, appearance of fire, and speaking 
            in foreign languages.<sup>3</sup> The great inaugural events of redemption &#8211; 
            Christ's death, resurrection, ascension and glorification (Pentecost) 
            &#8211; were attested to by great signs and wonders. At His death 
            the sun was darkened, at His resurrection there was an earthquake, 
            angels appeared to the disciples at His ascension, and wind, fire 
            and tongues were associated with His glorification and the Spirit's 
            initial outpouring upon the church. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Men are now called upon to identify 
              and participate in the benefits of Christ's death, resurrection, ascension 
              and glorification. It would be as wrong to demand wind, fire and foreign 
              languages to accompany the gift of the Spirit today as to expect to 
              see the sun darkened when we experience dying with Christ or an earthquake 
              when we rise to walk with Him in a new life. We are justified by faith, 
              and by faith (not sight, sound or feelings) we receive the Holy Spirit. 
              Miraculous demonstrations may or may not accompany the gift of the 
              Spirit. Faith does not rest on these, however, but rather on the infallible 
              Word of promise.</font></p>          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Acts 2:38 shows 
            us that, since Pentecost, the Spirit is given at the time of Christian 
            initiation. The baptism of the Spirit is associated with the baptism 
            into Christ. We are not here concerned with the mode of Christian 
            baptism<sup>4</sup>but with the <em>principle</em> of baptism. Baptism means that one 
            is identified with the death and resurrection of Christ (see Rom. 
            6:3-7). Faith unites and identifies the soul with Jesus. Those who 
            thereby share in Christ's death and resurrection, share in His glorification 
            at the right hand of God. This is why the Holy Spirit accompanies 
            Christian baptism. The book of Acts amply demonstrates that baptism 
            and the gift of the Holy Spirit belong together.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peter preached 
            Jesus to the Gentiles at the home of Cornelius. He said:</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;&#8230;God 
              anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who 
              went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the 
              devil; for God was with Him&#8230;To Him give all the prophets witness, 
              that through His name whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission 
              of sins. While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell 
              on all them which heard the Word. And they of the circumcision which 
              believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that 
              on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
              For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered 
              Peter, Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, 
              which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?&quot; Acts 10:38, 
              43-47.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What a clear testimony 
            to the truth that faith in Jesus for justification, or forgiveness 
            of sins, brings the gift of the Holy Spirit! This is further illustrated 
            by Paul's visit to Ephesus:</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And it 
              came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed 
              through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, 
              he said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? 
              And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there 
              be any Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye 
              baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. Then said Paul, John 
              verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the 
              people, that they should believe on Him which should come after 
              him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were baptized 
              in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands 
              upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, 
              and prophesied.&quot; Acts 19:1-6. </font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is strange 
            how some people will use this scripture in support of a post-conversion 
            baptism of the Holy Spirit, or &quot;second blessing.&quot; It would 
            be more consistent if they would use the passage to support the idea 
            of two water baptisms &#8211; one to become a Christian, and one more 
            to get the Holy Spirit. Paul's vital question, &quot;Have ye received 
            the Holy Ghost since ye believed?&quot; is not to be read as if Paul 
            were asking if they had gone on to receive the second blessing. The 
            Revised Standard Version more correctly translates the question, &quot;Did 
            you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&quot; Paul is really 
            saying, &quot;If you did not receive the Holy Spirit when you believed, 
            you have not true Christian faith.&quot; That is Paul's doctrine &#8211; 
            the Spirit comes when men believe in Jesus. But these disciples of 
            John had not shared in the blessing of Pentecost, for they had not 
            heard about Christ's atonement and glorification. The information 
            which they lacked was not information about the Holy Spirit as such, 
            but information on the gospel of Christ. Paul told them about Christ, 
            baptized them in the name of Jesus, and they shared in the blessing 
            of Pentecost. Thus, the gift of the Spirit must accompany Christian 
            baptism, else something is very wrong.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our Pentecostal 
            friends will then say, &quot;What about Acts 8? Philip preached the 
            gospel in Samaria. The people believed and were baptized. But they 
            did not receive the Holy Spirit until the apostles came down and prayed 
            for them.&quot;</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Now when 
              the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received 
              the Word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: who, when they 
              were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy 
              Ghost: (for as yet He was fallen upon none of them: only they were 
              baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) Then laid they their hands 
              on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.&quot; Acts 8:14-17.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will admit 
            that this is an exceptional case. But rather than prove that the Spirit 
            does not come at the time of conversion, it really proves the opposite. 
            According to Acts 2:38, the disciples knew that the gift of the Holy 
            Spirit should accompany baptism. But at Samaria (their first missionary 
            outreach to non-Jews) it did not. This led them to take immediate 
            steps to remedy the abnormal situation. That believers should be baptized 
            without having the gift of the Holy Spirit was unthinkable, a contradiction. 
            The apostles hastened down, prayed for the Samaritans, and they also 
            shared the blessing of Pentecost.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why did God work 
            this way in Samaria? When we consider the historical situation, the 
            reason is not difficult to determine. The Jews and the Samaritans 
            were traditionally hostile to each other. They were divided racially 
            and religiously. The Lord did not want this division to continue in 
            the Christian church. If the Samaritans had received the full blessing 
            of the gospel apart from the church at Jerusalem, they might have 
            been inclined to have a Christian church of their own. On the other 
            hand, the apostles were still inclined to be prejudiced against the 
            Samaritans. The leaders of the church needed to see that God put no 
            difference between the believing Jews and the believing Samaritans. 
            Acts 8 shows how the Spirit worked to preserve unity in the developing 
            church.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The idea of a 
            post-conversion, second-blessing gift of the Holy Spirit is unknown 
            in the book of Acts. When Paul preached the gospel to the heathen 
            Galatians, they believed and received the Spirit (Gal. 3:2). When 
            Paul and Barnabas returned to them, the apostles did not say, &quot;Last 
            time we preached to you the gospel. Now we want to give to you the 
            full gospel.&quot; No, for Paul's gospel was only and always the full 
            gospel &mdash; the gospel of Christ. But what did Paul tell them on his 
            second visit?</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;. . . 
              confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue 
              in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into 
              the kingdom of God.&quot; Acts 14:22.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no second 
            blessing suggested here. As men received Christ Jesus the Lord, so 
            they must walk in Him (Col. 2:6). Nowhere in the New Testament are 
            Christians exhorted to wait for the Holy Spirit; but through the Spirit 
            they are exhorted to wait, hope and expect the coming of Jesus Christ 
            in power and great glory (Gal. 5:5; Rom. 5:2; 8:23-24; Heb. 9:28; 
            1 Thess. 1:10). The coming of Jesus Christ and the glorification of 
            the saints are the real second blessing of the New Testament.</font></p>
          <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Why Modern 
            Pentecostalism Is a Complete Negation of the Truth of Justification</strong></font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The central thesis 
            of the Pentecostal movement is that the baptism, or infilling, of 
            the Spirit is a definite second blessing which comes at a time subsequent 
            to conversion. This Pentecostal thesis is a complete negation of the 
            truth of justification by faith. This is a most serious charge, and 
            we realize that it comes as a great shock to many Pentecostals who 
            think that they believe in justification by faith. It is true that 
            sometimes Pentecostals sound quite orthodox when dealing with justification; 
            but it is impossible to embrace the Pentecostal doctrine and hold 
            to the primacy, supremacy and all-sufficiency of justification by 
            faith, for the following reasons:</font></p>
          <p><strong><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Pentecostal 
            idea of a post-conversion baptism of the Spirit implies that God's 
            act of justification is not sufficient to bring the infilling of the 
            Spirit. But if God's gift of His own righteousness cannot qualify 
            the believer for the baptism of the Spirit, what else will? In the 
            light of Paul's message about the all-sufficiency of justification, 
            Pentecostalism is an awful error. If God's greatest work for the sinner 
            does not bring the Holy Spirit's infilling, then man must resort to 
            his own works &mdash; and so there are books and papers which advocate five 
            steps, seven steps or ten steps to receive the Spirit. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Psychological 
            gimmicks, &quot;emptyings,&quot; &quot;letting go,&quot; &quot;absolute 
            surrender&quot; and tricky inner doings are supposed to bring the 
            Holy Spirit.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Paul were here, 
            he would ask, &quot;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you were 
            justified (that is, when you believed)?&quot; If our answer were &quot;No,&quot; 
            Paul would reply, &quot;Then you have not received Christian justification.&quot; 
            He would not take us on to higher things; he would take us back to 
            fundamental things. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">2. </font></strong>The Pentecostal 
            teaching implies (and sometimes states explicitly) that the experience 
            of being baptized in the Spirit is something greater and beyond the 
            justification which comes by faith. Out of the abundance of the heart 
            the mouth speaks. Luther talked about justification most because to 
            him it was the chief doctrinal jewel of the Bible. Pentecostals talk 
            about their experience more than anything else simply because they 
            feel it is greater than the gift of justification. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justification 
            is the gift of God's righteousness, in all its totality, to the believing 
            sinner. In God's act of forgiveness, the entire inheritance of Jesus 
            Christ, the exceeding and eternal weight of glory, is given to the 
            believer. This gift can never be superseded, for in it God gives absolutely 
            all the accumulated treasure of eternity. So far from being greater, 
            the experience of being filled with the Spirit is called the &quot;firstfruits&quot; 
            (Rom. 8:23), guarantee or down payment (Eph.1:13-14) of that infinite 
            inheritance.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is as if a 
            man, journeying abroad, finds himself in need. A benefactor gives 
            him $30 million &#8212; a sum so large that it cannot be contained 
            on the traveler's person. So it is deposited to his account at home. 
            In the meantime, however, he draws $100 from the account as spending 
            money on the way. As he extol Is the goodness of his benefactor, which 
            does he talk about most &#8212; the $30 million or the $100?</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The grace which 
            is above us is always infinitely greater than the grace that is within us. Justification is like the whole ocean of water that 
            covers and surrounds the little shell. The experience in the Spirit 
            is like the bit of water the shell contains.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Pentecostalism 
            would make it appear that the down payment of the inheritance is greater 
            than the inheritance, that the $100 is more wealth than $30 million, 
            that the shell full of water is more than the ocean. In all this it 
            represents a serious distortion of the gospel message.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">3. </font></strong>Pentecostalism 
            presents an unfortunate dichotomy of receiving Christ and receiving 
            the Holy Ghost. Not only is the impression often left on minds that 
            the Holy Spirit gives a greater and richer blessing than the blessing 
            of the Savior, but Christ is not presented as a complete gift. The 
            Pentecostal doctrine declares that there is more to the gospel than 
            simply receiving Christ as a Savior. In fact, Pentecostal literature 
            often speaks demeaningly about those who only know Christ as a Savior. 
            But we are glad to affirm our faith in the all-sufficiency of Christ. 
            To know and receive Him as Savior is to receive all that God has to 
            give. He is both the power and wisdom of God (1 Cor. 1:24). To have 
            Jesus is to have all wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption 
            (1 Cor. 1:30). It is not only vain, but a positive denial of the gospel, 
            to look for a fullness that is outside or beyond Him. This was the 
            heresy that threatened the church at Colosse. But Paul affirmed before 
            the church the absolute all-sufficiency of Christ. &quot;In Him dwelleth 
            all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete [made 
            full) in Him&#8230;&#8221; Col. 2:9-10. </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, to 
            possess Christ is to possess all of the Godhead in Him. The Spirit 
            in all His infinite plentitude is given to every believer in Jesus. 
            Everything Christ has belongs to those who are &quot;married&quot; 
            to Him. Therefore, the gospel of Christ is the full gospel; and anything 
            that offers Christ plus something else is Judaising with another gospel.</font></p>

            makes two different events of the baptism into Christ and into the 
            Spirit. It proposes that the church is composed of ordinary (&quot;carnal&quot;) 
            Christians and Spirit-filled Christians &#8211; as if the church were 
            like one of those passenger ships with first- and second-class berths. 
            But the church is a one-class ship. There is &quot;one Lord, one faith, 
            one baptism&quot; (Eph. 4:5).</font></p>

            Christian baptism is therefore the baptism of the Father, it is the 
            baptism of Christ, and it is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. In proposing 
            another baptism and another experience, Pentecostalism goes beyond 
            the gospel of Christ and confesses that neither Christ nor His justification 
            is a complete gift of the Father.</font></p>
