        teacher that ever lived. God committed the teaching of righteousness by 
        faith to his trust. His understanding of this gospel truth was in advance 
        of all the other apostles. When the Reformers were struggling to get out 
        of the darkness of Romanism, only the writings of Paul could bring them 
        the needed deliverance. It was his clear utterances on &quot;the righteousness 
        which is of faith&quot; that gave birth to the Reformation:</font> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;He [Abraham) 
          received the sign of circumcision, a seal of<strong> the righteousness 
          of the faith</strong>.&quot; Rom. 4:11</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For the promise, 
          that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his 
          seed, through the law, but through<strong> the righteousness of faith</strong>.&quot; 
          Rom. 4:13</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Gentiles, 
          which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, 
          even <strong>the righteousness which is of faith</strong>.&quot; Rom. 
          9:30</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The <strong>righteousness 
          which is of faith</strong> speaketh on this wise.&quot; Rom. 10:6</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For we through 
          the Spirit wait for the hope of<strong> righteousness by faith</strong>.&quot; 
          Gal. 5:5</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;&#8230; <strong>the 
          righteousness which is of God by faith</strong>.&quot; Phil. 3:9</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Noah&#8230; 
          became heir of<strong> the</strong> <strong>righteousness which is by 
          faith</strong>.&quot; Heb. 11:7</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What Is Righteousness?</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is in the book of Romans, 
        more than any other epistle, that Paul most fully explains the truth of 
        the righteousness which is by faith. When Paul speaks of this saving, justifying righteousness, 
        he means nothing but the righteousness and purity of God Himself:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But now the 
          <strong>righteousness of God</strong> without the law is manifested 
          . . . even <strong>the righteousness of God</strong> which is by faith 
          of (in) Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe.&quot; Rom. 
          3:21, 22 </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God's righteousness was so 
        infinite, so incomprehensible, so beyond the ability of angels to endure, 
        that no language of heaven or earth could describe it. But God unfolded 
        it and put it on display in the gospel of His crucified sinless Son:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For I am not 
          ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation 
          to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 
          For therein is<strong> the righteousness of God revealed</strong>&quot; 
          Rom. 1:16-17</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;&#8230; being 
          justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ 
          Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in 
          His blood, to declare <strong>His righteousness</strong> for the remission 
          of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, 
          I say, at this time <strong>His righteousness</strong>: that He might 
          be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.&quot; Rom. 
          3:24-26</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hanging on the cross for guilty 
        sinners, Christ was the gospel. In this act God revealed His righteousness 
        to angels and to men.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How Much Righteousness?</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When God gave His Son to die 
        on behalf of sinful men, He gave His own life and perfect sinless righteousness for their 
        justification and acceptance before God. This was so because in Jesus was not only the sinless life of the 
        Father, but because of Christ's eternal divinity His life was the <em>total</em> life of the Father. Jesus could say, &quot;All things 
        that the Father hath are Mine.&quot; John 16:15. And Paul declared: &quot;For 
        in Him the complete being of God, by God's own choice, came to dwell.&quot; 
        &quot;For it is in Christ that the complete being of the Godhead dwells 
        embodied.&#8221; &quot;. . . in Him lie hidden all God's treasures of wisdom 
        and knowledge.&quot; Col. 1:19; 2:9, 3, N.E.B.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus Christ was not only sinless and perfect, 
        but <em>infinitely</em> perfect. His life was of infinite value because He was 
        the embodiment of divine life and righteousness. He came to the cross 
        and freely gave this life of infinite value for the worthless lives of 
        sinful men. Jesus was the total outlay of heaven's treasure, the accumulated 
        love and wealth of eternity, the totality of God's righteousness. When 
        we raise our little minds to comprehend the gospel, we are surveying the 
        biggest thing in the universe &mdash; the righteousness of God Himself. And 
        it is by His righteousness, <em>all</em> of His righteousness, and nothing less 
        than all of it, that sinners are justified.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again we ask, by whose righteousness 
        are sinners justified? By God's righteousness alone! And how much of God's 
        righteousness does it require to justify sinners? All of it! Such is the 
        value of the sacrifice made on Calvary. If one could collect all the righteousness 
        of all the angels and all the saints and total it together, it would be 
        as nothing compared to the incomprehensible and infinite righteousness 
        which was poured out for the salvation of guilty sinners. Such is the 
        righteousness which is &quot;unto all and upon all them that believe&quot; in Jesus. This righteousness is that of God Himself in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. </font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Justified 
        by Righteousness <em>Imputed</em></strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once we grasp the truth that 
        it is God's righteousness which justifies, and that it requires all of 
        it to justify, we can appreciate Paul's doctrine of justification by the 
          <em>imputation</em> of righteousness. The great error of Romanism consists in the 
        idea that a sinner can be justified by having righteousness poured into 
        him. As if the full glory and dimension of God's righteousness could be 
        reduced to an intra-human experience! How could the little human temple 
        contain the sum total of the accumulated treasure of eternity? Thus does 
        the mind of antichrist try to reduce the unspeakable gift </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="3">(&quot;Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!&quot; 2 Cor. 9:15</font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">) of God to something no bigger than a little human experience. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Imagine yourself standing beside 
        the mighty Amazon River, awed by the sheer vastness of its ceaseless stream. 
        Then in your thirst you step down to its bank with your little cup. Would 
        you be foolish enough to think that you could contain it all in your stomach? 
        Yet that Amazon is only a little thing in this little dot of a world, 
        which is only a dot in our solar system; and our solar system is but a 
        speck in the great galaxies of the universe. But above, beyond and greater 
        than all, is the mighty God and His righteousness; and even ten thousand 
        million Amazons could only faintly portray the mightiness of His righteousness. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet all of it has been poured out as a mighty stream of grace for my justification; 
          and it requires all of it, and nothing less than all of it, to justify 
          me, a sinner. Therefore, in order to be justified by an infused righteousness, 
          I would be confronted with something more impossible than drinking one 
          million Amazons. Remember, it takes the whole stream of God's grace to 
          give me right standing with God. Therefore I could never contain enough 
          in my experience in order to be justified.</font></p>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you received the news that 
        you had inherited a gift of thirty billion dollars, would you run to collect 
        it in a couple of suitcases? Why, it would be so vast that you could only 
        deposit it in your account at the bank. So God's gift of righteousness 
        in Jesus Christ is so incomprehensibly vast that He credits it to him 
        who believes and receives Jesus as a personal Savior. The little human 
        temple is far too small, too finite, to contain all of the immeasurable 
        wealth of God's favor; yet God freely imputes all of it for the repentant believer's 
        justification.   Christ  suffering   on the cross of Calvary  is the full revelation of the righteousness of God. This alone  draws us to Him as our Savior and Lord in repentance for our sins: </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? Romans 2:4 </font></p> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But to him 
          that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, 
          his faith is <strong>counted</strong> for righteousness. Even as David 
          also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God <strong>imputeth 
          </strong>righteousness without works . . .&quot; Rom. 4:5, 6. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Believer's 
        Justifying Righteousness Is in Heaven</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the little human temple 
        cannot contain all of the righteousness of God, it is utterly impossible 
        to stand justified by a &quot;within&quot; righteousness. There is only 
        one temple great enough to contain this saving righteousness, and that 
        is the temple in heaven (Hebrews 8:1-2). </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hebrews 8:1-2  We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,  a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man. </font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And more glorious yet, there is 
            a Man in that temple who contains the sum total of God's righteousness. 
            This is the mystery of the incarnation. That Man is the God-Man, and in 
            Him dwells &quot;all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&quot; Col. 2:9. 
            Therefore our justification may be found only in Him (See Isa. 45:24).</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have sworn by Myself; The word has gone out of My mouth in righteousness, And shall not return, That to Me every knee shall bow, Every tongue shall take an oath.   He shall say, 'Surely in the LORD I have righteousness and strength. To Him men shall come, And all shall be ashamed who are incensed against Him.   In the LORD all the descendants of Israel shall be justified, and shall glory.' &quot; Isaiah 45:23-25   </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, it is most certain that 
        the righteousness which gives believers right standing with God is found 
        only in heaven, only in one Man. Indeed, the righteousness of the saints 
        is Christ Himself, as Jeremiah 23:6 declares, &quot;This is His name whereby 
        He shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justifying righteousness is 
        not found on earth, but millions of light years away. Justifying righteousness 
        is never found in the believer, but it always remains outside of and extrinsic 
        to him. The righteousness which is of faith does not try to bring that 
        righteousness down to earth (Rom. 10:6-11), </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Romans 10:6-11  But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way, &quot;Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' &quot; (that is, to bring Christ down from above)  or, &quot;'Who will descend into the abyss?' &quot; (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).  But what does it say? &quot;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart&quot; (that is, the word of faith which we preach):  that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  For the Scripture says, &quot;Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.&quot; </font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">but the word of faith which is 
            preached in the gospel enables man to believe &quot;unto righteousness.&quot; 
        Rom. 10:10. Faith reaches beyond this earth, enters heaven itself, and 
        embracing that Man at God's right hand, declares, &quot;This is my Righteousness.&quot;</font></p>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God has mercifully placed the 
        treasure of our justifying righteousness in heaven. No moth can eat it, no rust can 
        corrupt it, and no thief can steal it. This righteousness is tried and 
        tested. It can never fail, for it is everlasting. The only thing we need 
        is faith in it. If our faith lays hold on this heavenly treasure, one 
        day God will take us to where our righteousness is. In the meantime we 
        must be content to have this righteousness imputed to us who believe only by faith. If on the other 
        hand we follow the mind of antichrist by trying to bring this justifying righteousness 
        down to this earth, God will leave us on this earth to perish with the 
        man of sin.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Reformation 
        Concept of Righteousness by Faith</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God revealed the Pauline teaching 
        of righteousness by faith to Martin Luther, and with it he blazed the 
        trail from the darkness of Romanism. His was the clearest voice in Christendom 
        on justification by faith since the days of the apostle Paul. Said Luther:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This, then, 
          is the amazing definition of Christian righteousness. It is the divine 
            <strong>imputing</strong> or <strong>accounting</strong> for righteousness or unto righteousness because 
          of faith in Christ or for Christ's sake. When the sophists hear this 
          definition, they laugh, because they imagine righteousness to be a certain 
          quality that is poured into the soul and then spread into all the parts 
          of man. . . . Therefore this unspeakable gift excels all reason: God 
            <strong>accounts</strong> and <strong>acknowledges him as righteous</strong> without any works who apprehends 
          His Son by faith alone.&quot; &mdash; <em>What Luther Says</em>, compiled 
          by Ewald M. Plass, vol.3, pp.1229-1230. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the troubled soul of John 
        Bunyan heard a voice saying, &quot;Your righteousness is in heaven,&quot; 
        he was delivered from darkness and stepped into the light of the righteousness 
        which is of faith. This soul, who breathed the very atmosphere of heaven 
        in Bedford jail, expressed the same concepts as Martin Luther.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wrote Bunyan:</font></p>

          earth.&quot;&mdash; <em>Justification by an Imputed Righteousness </em>(Swengel, 
          Penn.: Reiner Publications, 1967). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;That this 
          righteousness still resides in and with the person of Christ, even then 
          when we stand just before God thereby, is clear, for that we are said

          seed of Israel be justified.' And again: 'Surely, shall one say, in 
          the Lord have I righteousness,' &amp;c. And again: 'For of him are ye

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The righteousness which is 
        imputed to the believer in Jesus gives him a standing with God higher 
        than the standing enjoyed by Adam in his sinless state. It gives him a 
        higher standing than the angels. It raises him in the scale of moral value 
        to be on an equality with Jesus Christ. Such is the gift of God's justifying 
        righteousness, which comes by the faith of Jesus Christ. Yet it is in 
        heaven, not on earth; outside of us, never within the greatest saint; 
        in Jesus Christ, and no one but Jesus Christ.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Gift of 
        the Spirit</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But says one, &quot;Don't you 
        believe that righteousness must be inwrought in the human character? What 
        about the believer's sanctification?&quot; To which we answer, We certainly 
        believe in the necessity of moral renovation within man. Christians will 
        live righteously in this present evil world. But the most excellent virtues 
        within the saints have no part in their justification before God. The 
        law requires a far more excellent righteousness than is found within any 
        man's experience.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is most important to observe 
        that Paul never confuses the saving righteousness of God with the work 
        of grace upon the hearts of God's people. Paul speaks of two gifts: the 
        gift of righteousness (Rom. 5:17), and the gift of the Spirit (Rom.5:5). 
        In the book of Romans Paul shows that this gift of righteousness is <strong>imputed</strong> 
        (credited), and the gift of the Spirit is <strong>imparted</strong> (infused). The 
        gift of righteousness places the believer in such favorable standing with 
        God that he is given access to the gift of the indwelling Holy Spirit. Romans 5:1-5 
        shows that the Spirit is poured in the heart as a result of justification. 
        Or as Paul says in Romans 8:10, the Spirit brings life &quot;because you 
        have been justified.&quot; N.E.B.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Spirit is poured upon believers 
        on no other basis than the righteousness of Christ. It is not bestowed 
        because of a man's <em>attainment</em>, but because of Christ's <em>atonement</em>. Nothing 
        but the doing and dying of Christ can entitle anyone to receive the gift 
        of the Holy Spirit. But when a repentant sinner grasps by faith the sacrifice of 
        Christ in His behalf, God's righteousness is upon him. He appears before 
        God not only as if he had never sinned, but he is clothed with more moral 
        excellence than the angel Gabriel.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Spirit reproduces in the 
        life of the believer the attributes of the character of Christ. He stirs 
        him up to all manner of diligence, making him willing to do and to die 
        for the Master. But none of these virtues, be it ever so excellent, justifies 
        the believer. They are not the <em>root </em> of his right standing with God, but 
        the <em>fruit</em> of it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Holy Spirit does not come 
        to speak of Himself (John 16:13-15). </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you. All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and declare it to you.&quot; John 16:13-15</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a reason for not knowing His 
          name. He comes only to glorify Christ. It is His work to create faith 
          in Jesus, and to continually lead the repentant believer to Christ from the start of his life to its finish. (Rom. 1:17). </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes, Jews first and also Gentiles.   This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, &quot;It is through faith that a righteous person has life.&quot; Romans 1:16-17 NLT </font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The just lives by faith in his Righteousness 
              which is up in heaven, and it is the Spirit's work to create, maintain 
              and strengthen that faith. The more the Spirit works within a  believer, 
              the more it will lead him to rely on that righteousness which is outside, 
              above and beyond him. The Spirit will never lead a man to look within 
              his own experience for acceptance and right standing with God. As John Bunyan testified:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As for thy 
          saying that salvation is Christ within, if thou mean in opposition to 
          Christ without, instead of pleading for Christ thou wilt plead against 
          him; for Christ, God-man, without on the cross, did bring in salvation 
          for sinners; and the right believing of that justifies the soul. Therefore 
          Christ within or the Spirit of him who did give himself a ransom, doth 
          not work out justification for the soul in the soul, but doth lead the 
          soul out of itself and out of what can be done within itself, to look 
          for salvation in that man that is now absent from his saints on earth&#8230;. 
          &quot;And indeed they that will follow Christ aright must follow him 
          without, to the cross without, for justification on Calvary without 
          &mdash; that is, they must seek for justification by his obedience without 
          &mdash; to the grave without, and to his ascension and intercession in heaven 
          without; and this must be done through the operation of his own Holy 
          Spirit that he has promised shall show these things unto them, being 
          given within them for that purpose. Now the Spirit of Christ, that leads 
          also; but whither? It leads to Christ without.&quot; &mdash; <em>The Riches 
          of Bunyan</em> (New York: The American Tract Society, 1850), pp.142, 
          143.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;&#8230; if 
          you do not put a difference between justification wrought by the Man 
          Christ without, and sanctification wrought by the Spirit of Christ within 
          .. . you are not able to divide the word aright; but contrariwise, you 
          corrupt the word of God, and cast stumbling blocks before the people, 
          and will certainly one day most deeply smart for your folly, except 
          you repent.&quot; &mdash; <em>Ibid</em>, p.140. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">True sanctification, being 
        an inward work, is for the most part invisible and imperceptible to the 
        one who experiences it. It may be illustrated by this physical fact&#8212; we 
        can see <em>others</em>, but we cannot see <em>ourselves</em>. So it is in the spiritual 
        realm. It is our work to behold Christ, to rejoice that He is our righteousness, 
        and to rest in the fact that His righteousness is all-sufficient.</font></p>
