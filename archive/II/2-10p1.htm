      I </font><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      </font></strong> <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Romanism had come about through a confusion of law and gospel. According to Luther, the Reformation was born when men were enabled to rightly divide the law and the gospel. Thus, the proper distinction between the <em>law</em> and the <em>gospel</em> was the great contribution of the Reformation of the sixteenth century.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Reformers rightly defined<em> Law</em> as any command, instruction or exhortation which defines duty &#8211; i.e., what we should do, how we should live, what we must be. &quot;Love thy neighbour,&quot; &quot;Be ye therefore perfect,&quot; &quot;Purify your minds,&quot; &quot;Entertain strangers,&quot; are examples of law. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4">Gospel</font></strong> is the good news that God has fulfilled the demands of the law for all men in Jesus Christ. For example, &quot;Christ died for our sins,&quot; &quot;Ye are bought with a price,&quot; &quot;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law,&quot; are pure gospel. Law says, &quot;Do&quot;; gospel says, &quot;Done.&quot; Law commands; gospel promises. Law kills; gospel gives life. Law condemns; gospel justifies.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet the battle of the Reformation was not finished when God rescued the church from the terrible error of co-mingling law and gospel. There is an opposite error. This consists in <em>divorcing</em> the law from the gospel. While the Church of Rome made shipwreck by <em>confusing</em> law and gospel, the Protestant church faces the peril of <em>separating</em> the law from the gospel. The first error causes men to attempt salvation by their own works. The second error leads them to think they can be saved in their sins.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gospel takes the law seriously. The sinner can be justified on no other basis than perfect obedience to the law (Rom. 2:13). </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NKJ Romans 2:13 &#8220;for not the hearers of the law are just in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be justified;&#8221;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Law Giver Himself 
        came to this world to render that perfect obedience in man's behalf. By 
        His own perfect living in human flesh He magnified the law and made it 
        honorable (Isa. 42:21). </font>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NKJ Isaiah 42:21 
          &#8220;The LORD is well pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will 
          exalt the law and make it honorable.&#8221;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By dying under its 
        penalty Christ showed that the law is holy, just, good, unchangeable and 
        everlasting (Rom. 7:12; Ps. 19:7-9).</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NKJ Romans 7:12 &#8220;Therefore 
        the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.&#8221;</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NKJ Psalm 19:7-9 
          &#8220;The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul; The testimony 
          of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple; The statutes of the LORD 
          are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the LORD is pure, 
          enlightening the eyes; The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; 
          The judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.&#8221;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gospel has a higher 
        and broader purpose than man's salvation. It is that God Himself might 
        be just as well as the Justifier of him that believeth in Jesus (Rom. 
        3:26). </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NKJ Romans 3:25-26 
        &#8220;whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, 
            to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed 
            over the sins that were previously committed, 26 to demonstrate at the 
            present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier 
            of the one who has faith in Jesus.&#8221;</font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The object of the 
        atonement is that the divine law and government might be maintained.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a view of 
        the atonement that transcends any subjective benefit. God was not only 
        saving lost men at the cross, but he was securing the whole universe. 
        He was not only justifying sinners, but he was justifying His own law 
        and government.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a sinner in 
        rebellion against God's law. He longs to be saved. What he must see is 
        that his salvation depends upon the vindication of the very law which 
        he has despised. The cross, above all else, is a vindication of God's 
        law. Christ honored its claims by bearing its just penalty in behalf of 
        sinners. If the sinner really sees the meaning of the cross, he will exercise 
        repentance toward God for the transgression of His law, and faith in the 
        Lord Jesus Christ, who fulfilled all its claims in His behalf.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Acts 20:20-21 I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house, 21 &quot;testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</font> </p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4">The Law of 
        God </font></strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The law of God may be likened to a tree and the gospel to the fruit which 
          it bears. In heaven a controversy arose over that &quot;tree.&quot; Lucifer 
          contended that it should be plucked up, and he proposed planting a better 
          one. Even the angels did not understand the full extent of the love, wisdom 
          and holiness of the law. But with the advent of sin, the time had come 
          for that &quot;tree&quot; to bear &quot;fruit&quot; and demonstrate its 
          worth.</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The life and death 
        of Jesus were the unfolding of God's law to angels and to men. Hanging 
        on the cross, Christ was the gospel &mdash; the fruit of the tree. What a wonderful 
        tree God's law proved to be at Calvary! When the angelic hosts saw the 
        Son of God yield up His life of infinite value, with one voice they extolled 
        the greatness of God's law. Every soul who sees Calvary as the law of 
        God unfolded will say with the psalmist, &quot;O how love I Thy law! it 
        is my meditation all the day.&quot; Ps. 119:97.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his state of rebellion 
        against the law of God, man has been denied access to the Tree of Life, but not the sinner who looks upon the cross and sees the awful results 
        of breaking a law so good and holy. As he sees His Substitute bearing 
        the curse of his transgression upon the tree (NKJ Galatians 3:13 &#8220;Christ 
        has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us 
        for it is written, &quot;Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree&quot;) 
        that tree of shame is discerned as the Tree of Life. This Tree has borne 
        Fruit so precious that if a repentant sinner eats of it he shall be cured 
        of sin and live forever. That Fruit is the Son of God Himself. He declares, 
        &quot;Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life.&quot; 
        John 6:54. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The law is the tree, 
        the gospel is the fruit. Those who eat this fruit assimilate the very 
        life of the tree. Thus the true believer in the gospel assimilates the 
        very life and character of the law of God (See: NKJ Romans 8:4 &#8220;that 
        the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not 
        walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.&#8221;)</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Perfect Obedience 
        to the Law as a Gift</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;By the obedience 
        of One shall many be made righteous.&quot; Rom. 5:19. Jesus showed us 
        plainly the nature of His obedience: &quot;I have kept My Father's commandments, 
        and abide in His love.&quot; John 15:10. The righteousness of Christ is 
        perfect obedience to the law of Jehovah. The law is infinite, and it embodies 
        an infinite righteousness (Ps. 119:96, 144, N.E.B.) In manifesting an 
        infinitely perfect character, Jesus rendered an obedience that measured 
        with the broadest claims of God's law.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the gospel offers 
        men the righteousness of Christ, it offers them a life of unblemished 
        obedience to the law of God. As Christ dies on the cross, He gives His 
        most precious legacy to His disciples &mdash; the law of God unbroken, unmarred 
        in the gift of His own life.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everyone wants to 
        keep a precious gift. God's law has been given to us in the unblemished 
        character of Jesus Christ. This gift cost the life of the Son of God; 
        it emptied heaven; it contained all the accumulated wealth of eternity. 
        Surely a believer could not bring himself to despise and spit upon a gift 
        like that. In His last words to His disciples, Jesus said, &quot;If ye 
        love Me, keep My commandments.&quot; John 14:15.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only those who believe 
        on the Son of God can keep the commandments, for the law is a gift to 
        the followers of Christ. The psalmist declares: &quot;Thy testimonies 
        have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my 
        heart.&quot; Ps. 119:111. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us illustrate how perfect obedience to the 
          law is a gift in Jesus Christ, and see how a believer will keep the law 
          because it is given to him as a precious heritage:<br>
        <br>
        Here is a Christian who is convicted by the law that he is a slothful 
        servant in his service for God. He sees that he may be lazy or be a Christian, 
        but he cannot be both. Unless he becomes &quot;diligent in business,&quot; 
        the sentence will be pronounced upon him, &quot;Thou wicked and slothful 
          servant.&quot;</font></p>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only right way 
        to become diligent is by way of the gospel. The convicted sinner looks 
        upon the diligence of His Substitute. In His life there were no idle moments. 
        He was always about His Father's business. He was the unwearied servant 
        of man's necessities. Not one careless, thoughtless act marred that life 
        of infinite value. He did not fail, nor was He discouraged, but set His 
        face as a flint until He could say, &quot;I have finished the work that 
        Thou gavest Me to do.&quot; The contemplation of this life not only works 
        conviction and repentance for slothfulness, but it works faith. For the 
        sinner's history was imputed to Christ in order that His history may be 
        imputed to the sinner. The sinner grasps by faith the history of Jesus 
        as his own. He comes before God and His law with nothing to present as 
        his plea save the diligence of Jesus Christ. The Father accepts with great 
        joy the merits of His Son offered in the transgressor's behalf. He calls 
        His angels and says in the presence of the universe, &quot;See this repentant 
        sinner. This is My diligent son in whom I am well pleased.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By faith in Christ's 
        diligence, the believer stands as diligent in the sight of God. But having 
        accepted this life of perfect diligence, what does the believer now aspire 
        to be above everything else? He wants to be what God has pronounced Him 
        as being in Jesus Christ. His determination to be diligent does not come 
        from outward compulsion, but from inward constraint. The Holy Spirit has 
        written the law of diligence in his heart, and helps him to walk in the 
        way of God's commandment. The way of the gospel is completely contrary 
        to the way of righteousness by law. God <em>pronounces</em> the believer diligent 
        in order that it may motivate him to <em>become</em> diligent. The same principle 
        operates in any area of Christian living.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But if a man strives 
        to become diligent in order that God will pronounce him diligent, he is 
        always under the law, under the curse, because he always falls short of 
        the divine standard. The gospel believer may also fall short of reaching 
        the standard in himself, but because he trusts in Christ's diligence and 
        not his own, the merit of His Substitute constantly makes up for his deficiency. 
        Thus the gospel presents a life of perfect obedience to the law of God 
        as a free gift in Christ. The believer in Jesus keeps the law, not in 
        order to become righteous in God's sight, but because he has become righteous 
        in God's sight. He aspires to keep what God has given him in Christ. The 
        law is an expression of God's idea. When we receive it in Christ, it becomes 
        our idea.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Rejoicing 
        in the Law</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have you ever wondered 
        why the psalmist seems to almost leap for sheer joy and delight in the 
        law of the Lord? No one who receives the commandments as mere threats, 
        commands and directions could do that. God imputes to the believer the 
        perfect righteousness of the law. This means that the believer can survey 
        the law as a heritage, as some mighty wealth that belongs to him. He strolls 
        about the law in the sheer joy of a man who inspects a wonderful inheritance. 
        Why, he is looking at the extent of the righteousness given him in Jesus! 
        The broader, the higher and the deeper he discovers the law to be, the 
        more he wonders and appreciates what wealth is his in Jesus Christ. &quot;Oh,&quot; 
        he exclaims, &quot;I did not realize so much was imputed to me!&quot; 
        This is not only his Father's law, but because he is now a son, it is 
        his law too. He too is jealous for it:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Horror hath 
          taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake Thy law. &#8230;.Rivers 
          of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not Thy law.&quot; Ps. 
          119:53, 136. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As contempt for God's 
        law becomes more and more universal, His people will hold it more and 
        more sacred. All of God's people will pray in earnest, &quot;It is time 
        for Thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void Thy law.&quot; Ps. 119:126. 
        In response to that prayer, the Spirit will fall in power upon the church. 
        The whole world will be enlightened with that message of justification 
        by faith which is made manifest in obedience to all the commandments of 
        God.</font><br>
