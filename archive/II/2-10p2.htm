        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ye are not under the law, but under grace.&quot; Rom. 6:14. &quot;Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?&quot; Gal. 4:21.</font> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To be under the law means to be under the old covenant. Under the terms of this covenant, the people promise God to meet all the claims that the law has upon their lives (Ex. 19:8). </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NKJ Exodus 19:8 Then all the people answered together and said, &quot;All that the LORD has spoken we will do.&quot; So Moses brought back the words of the people to the LORD.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They accept the responsibility to present to God a life that will measure with the broadest demands of the law.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"> There is no salvation under such a covenant, for there is none among the fallen race who can, in himself, meet the claims of God's law. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">In Romans 7:1-8 Paul likens being under the law to being married to a husband who stirs up all manner of evil.</font></font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      </font></p>      
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="3"> Imagine a woman married to a husband who only criticizes 
        her best efforts to please. Let her try ever so hard to serve him, the 
        husband still finds fault. Naturally, love cannot exist in such a union. 
        Only evil can come of it. So it is when a man assumes the responsibility 
        to please the law with his obedience. The law will always find fault. 
        It will always condemn. And under the exasperating experience of trying 
        to satisfy its demands, the heart of man will fret against God and loathe 
        a service that seems so intolerably exacting.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">Of course, as Paul hastens to point out, we do not condemn 
        the law because it finds fault with sinful man. We rather extol it as 
        &quot;holy, and just, and good,&quot; for the very reason that it refuses 
        to come down to the level of fallen man.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">There are some who say, &quot;Oh, I know that in my own 
        strength I cannot tender an obedience that will satisfy the demands of 
        God's law. But by God's help through His Holy Spirit, I can do it.&quot; 
        They do not stop to consider that even the Pharisee could pray, &quot;God,<em> I thank thee</em>, that I am not as other men.&quot; Everyone 
        who places himself under the law will say that he intends to satisfy its 
        demands with God's help.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">But we want to make the point crystal clear that God does 
        not help any man fulfill the conditions of His covenant. We believe in<em> imparted righteousness,</em> but not for the purpose of helping a 
        believer satisfy the demands of God's law! There are many people who think 
        that imparted righteousness is a means of fulfilling the terms of the 
        old covenant. Never!</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">The new covenant is established on better promises (NKJ 
        Hebrews 8:6) &#8220;But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, 
        inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established 
        on <em>better promises.</em>&#8221; Whereas the old covenant was 
        between God and the people, the new covenant was between God and Christ 
        (Zech. 6:13). In the new arrangement, Christ stands in the place of the 
        people. As their Substitute, He promises to meet every demand of the law 
        on man's behalf.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">Whereas under the old covenant man failed to meet the 
        demands of the law, under the new covenant, man <em>&#8212;(the Man) </em>&#8212;made good every promise to satisfy the broadest claims of the law.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">In the first place, Christ, as man's Substitute, rendered 
        an obedience that equaled the law in every respect. Jesus revealed a character 
        that was infinitely perfect (Colossians 1:19; 2:9). </font></p>
      </font> <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">NKJ Colossians 
          1:19 &#8220;For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should 
          dwell,&#8221; </font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NKJ Colossians 
          2:9&#8221; &#8220;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead 
          bodily;&#8221; </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p><font size="3">No one but the infinite Son of the infinite God could 
        render an obedience equal to the Law<sup>1</sup>. But the law also demanded that man 
        die for his transgression. Christ was executed in man's place. By infinite 
        humiliation and inexpressible suffering, He met this demand of the law. 
        When the Son of God died on the cross, He fully exhausted the demands 
        of the law. He fulfilled all righteousness (Matt. 3:15). </font></p>
      </font> <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">NKJ Matthew 
          3:15 &#8220;But Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;Permit it to be 
          so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.&quot; 
          Then he allowed Him.&#8221;</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p><font size="3">He fulfilled every jot and tittle of the law (Matt. 5:17-18). 
        </font></p>
      </font> <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">NKJ Matthew 
          5:17 &quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. 
          I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For assuredly, I say to you, 
          till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means 
          pass from the law till all is fulfilled.&#8221;</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p><font size="3">He could truly say, &quot;All that the Lord hath said, 
        I have done.&quot; He met every condition of the covenant. It was ratified 
        and sealed by His blood.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">Since Christ, on behalf of the whole human race, has fulfilled 
        every condition of the covenant, the believer is never called upon to 
        satisfy the demands of God's law. Those who insist on doing it, however, 
        will certainly do what they choose. By suffering the same sort of death 
        as Jesus Christ, the law will exhaust its demands upon their shelterless 
        heads. We repeat: Christ did not come to give us power to stay under the 
        law and meet its demands. Never! The apostle Paul emphatically declares:</font></p>
      </font> <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;But 
          when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made 
          of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, 
          that we might receive the adoption of sons.&quot; Gal. 4:4, 5.</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p><font size="3">Only a life of infinite value could satisfy the law on 
        behalf of humanity. Only a sacrifice of infinite worth could exhaust the 
        debt. The life of Jesus may be copied, but it cannot be duplicated. Thus 
        it is clear that Jesus did not come to give us strength to fulfill the 
        conditions of the covenant. He fulfilled the conditions Himself. And since 
        He did it as the Substitute of the human race, it was the same as if every 
        man had lived and died as Jesus did (2 Cor. 5:14). Christ Himself is &quot;a 
        covenant of the people&quot; (Isa. 42:6) &#8211; that is to say; he who 
        accepts Christ is counted as having met every covenant condition. </font></p>
      </font> <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">NKJ Isaiah 
          42:6 &quot;I, the LORD, have called You in righteousness, And will hold 
          Your hand; I will keep You and give You as a covenant to the people, 
          As a light to the Gentiles,&#8221;</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p><font size="4"><strong>The End of the Law for Righteousness</strong></font></p>
      </font><p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness 
        to everyone that believeth.&quot; Rom 10:4. This means that the one who 
        accepts Christ by faith has met and fulfilled every requirement and demand 
        of the law. Therefore the repentant believer is not under law, but under grace &mdash; 
        meaning that he is no longer required to satisfy the demands of the law. 
        The entire debt has been paid by Jesus Christ. Christ is the termination 
        of the broadest demands of the law. When the sinner runs into Jesus as 
        his covenant refuge, the law is fully satisfied.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <p><font size="3">Against every &quot;Do&quot; of the law, the repentant believer 
        in Jesus can write the &quot;Done&quot; of the gospel. Law says, &quot;Be 
        ye therefore perfect&quot; (Matt. 5:48). Gospel says, &quot;Ye have been 
        brought to perfection in Him&quot; (Col. 2:10). Thus Christ is the end 
        (the fulfillment) of that law which says, &quot;Be perfect.&quot; Nothing 
        is lacking.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4"><strong>The New Service of Love</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3">We have seen that being under the law is the same as being 
        married to the law as the first husband (referring to Paul's analogy in 
        Romans 7). And the apostle declares:</font></p>
      </font> <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;Wherefore, 
          my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; 
          that ye should be married to another, even to Him who is raised from 
          the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. . . . But now we 
          are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that 
          we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the 
          letter.&quot; Rom. 7:4, 6.</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p><font size="3">Deliverance from law does not mean paying no regard to 
        its just and holy principles. It means the end of the old <em>relationship</em>        to it. As believers in Jesus, we are no longer condemned debtors, no longer 
        slaves ground down by the impossible task of trying to satisfy the law's 
        demands. The freedom which Paul speaks of is the freedom of sons who &quot;serve 
        in newness of spirit.&quot; &quot;So then with the mind I myself serve 
        the law of God.&quot; Rom. 7:25; see also Gal. 4:1-6. </font></p>
      </font>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">NKJ Galatians 
          4:1 &#8220;Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not 
          differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, but is under 
          guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. Even 
          so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of 
          the world. But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth 
          His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were 
          under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. And because 
          you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, 
          crying out, &quot;Abba, Father!&#8221;.</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <p><font size="3">This service is free. It does not come from slaves, but 
        from sons. It is not offered to meet the law's infinite demands, but to 
        express thanks for adoption. In Christ, and in Him alone, is there an 
        obedience with which the law is well pleased. An obedience that measures 
        with the highest claims of the law is found only as God's people abide 
        in Christ by faith.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><sup>1</sup> When man aspired to be like God, yet be independent of Him, it seems that he placed himself where he was obligated to render a righteousness that would equal the law, or God Himself. Justice now demanded that he could not be saved unless this finite creature did the "infinite impossibility." Then we see that God takes man's place, and does it for him. Thus fallen man is given a life of greater value than sinless Adam or even sinless angels, for he is counted as having produced a life of equal value to the law.</font></font> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;</font>        </p>      <HR size=4 color="#E96F6F" >      <p align="center"><br>
