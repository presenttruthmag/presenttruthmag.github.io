      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Catholicism 
          Affirms &#8220;By Grace Alone&#8221;</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The New Testament 
        writers are emphatic that salvation is by grace alone (Rom. 3:24, 28; 
        4:5; 11:6; Gal. 2:16-21; Eph. 2:8-10; Titus 3:5-8). </font> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> NKJ Romans 3:24, 28 &#8220;being 
          justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ 
          Jesus&#8230;Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart 
          from the deeds of the law.&#8221;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NKJ Romans 4:5 &#8220;But 
          to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, 
          his faith is accounted for righteousness,&#8221;</font></p> 
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NKJ Romans 11:6 
          &#8220;And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace 
          is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise 
          work is no longer work.&#8221;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NKJ Galatians 2:16-21 
          &quot;knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but 
          by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that 
          we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the 
          law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified. But if, 
          while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found 
          sinners, is Christ therefore a minister of sin? Certainly not! For if 
          I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. 
          For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. For 
          I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. I have been 
          crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives 
          in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in 
          the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. I do not set aside 
          the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ 
          died in vain.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NKJ Ephesians 2:8-10 
          &#8220;For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not 
          of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should 
          boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good 
          works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.&#8221;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NKJ Titus 3:5-8 
          &#8220;&#8230;not by works of righteousness which we have done, but 
          according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration 
          and renewing of the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us abundantly 
          through Jesus Christ our Savior, that having been justified by His grace 
          we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. This is 
          a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, 
          that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good 
          works. These things are good and profitable to men.&#8221; </font></p>

      <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first open challenge 
      in the Church to salvation by grace was by Pelagius (about A.D. 400). He 
      proposed that man was able to live a holy life by the natural powers given 
      him of God, and thus obtain salvation. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p><font size="3">Augustine vigorously opposed Pelagianism and spelled out 
        the orthodox view of man&#8217;s depravity and need of divine grace.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">In a series of councils, the Catholic Church sided with 
        Augustine. And it is important to notice that Augustine was a great champion 
        of the doctrine of salvation by grace alone. Within the Church, others 
        arose to oppose Augustinian theology by proposing views which became known 
        as semi-Pelagianism. The councils of the Church even condemned semi-Pelagianism. 
        Catholic authors cite these facts of history in an effort to demonstrate 
        how the Church has always stood by the New Testament teaching of salvation 
        by grace.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">It comes as a surprise to many Protestants to see how 
        freely Catholic authors quote the Bible on salvation by grace. It appears 
        that the Roman authors can live quite comfortably with these passages 
        of Scripture. We quote from a representative Catholic book, <em>The Theology 
        of Grace</em>, by Jean Daujat (London; Burns &amp; Gates, 1959):</font></p>
      </font> <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;St. Paul 
          tells us that we are &#8216;justified freely by his grace, and that 
          we are &#8216;saved according to the election of grace,<sup>12</sup> and if by grace 
          it is not now by works: otherwise grace is no more grace&#8217;.<sup>13</sup> To 
          the Corinthians, he writes: &#8216;By the grace of God I am what I am&#8217;,<sup>14</sup>          and speaks to the Ephesians of &#8216;Christ, by whose grace you are 
          saved . . . for by grace you are saved . . . and that not of yourselves, 
          for it is the gift of God&#8217;<sup>15</sup>. He reminds Timothy that &#8216;God 
          has called me by his holy calling, not according to our own works, but 
          according to his own purpose and grace&#8217;.<sup>16</sup> And again: &#8216;To 
          every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the giving 
          of Christ&#8217;.<sup>17</sup> The same Apostle writes to Titus: &#8216;That 
          being justified by his grace, we may be heirs according to the hope 
          of life everlasting&#8217;.<sup>18</sup> and again to the Ephesians that God 
          has predestinated us unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which 
          he hath graced us in his beloved Son&#8217;.&quot;<sup>19</sup></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;We have already 
          quoted St. Paul&#8217;s words to the Romans: The charity of God is poured 
          forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit whom we have received. Charity 
          is the life of Christ present in us by the Holy Spirit. It is Jesus 
          who, dwelling in us through the gift of the Holy Spirit, loves God perfectly 
          in us through the Holy Spirit by whom we are animated and moved. So 
          St. Teresa of Lisieux could write: &#8216;When I am charitable, it is 
          only our Lord acting in me.&#8217; Of ourselves, we are incapable of 
          a single movement of love, unless it comes to us by the grace of Christ 
          abiding in us by the Holy Spirit.&#8221; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Of ourselves, 
          we have not, and cannot have, merit, virtue or holiness. It is Jesus 
          Christ, living in us, substituting his life of grace for our natural, 
          sinful life, who is our merit and our sanctity. We are capable of meritorious 
          and holy living only in the measure in which we have renounced the sinful, 
          natural life inherited from Adam, our desires and impulses that are 
          purely sensuous, as also our own opinions and self-will, in order to 
          live henceforth the &#8216;Christ-life&#8217; that must permeate everything 
          in us.&#8221; </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his book, <em>The 
        Life of Grace</em>, P. Gregory Stevens says:</font> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;St. Paul 
          has summarized the plight of man without Christ and without grace in 
          a single sentence: &#8216;For when we were in the flesh the sinful passions, 
          which were aroused by the Law, were at work in our members so that they 
          brought forth fruit unto death.&#8217; (Rom. 7.5) Man without Christ 
          is doomed to death because he is subject to and unable to control the 
          sinful movements of the flesh, a principle of rebellion against God. 
          In causing man to become more conscious of sin, the Law heightened his 
          responsibility; but it gave no power to fulfill its own prescriptions. 
          Even those Jews who, like the Pharisees, took pride in their own ability 
          to live out the Law are defeated by the Law, for grace comes only through 
          Christ. Only through grace is man liberated from that bondage to Satan 
          which leads to death. In his gracious mercy the Father has sent his 
          Son to free man, to unite man with the living Trinity, to lead man to 
          the plenitude of his destiny in the grace of Christ. (Ephesians 2 may 
          be studied as a summary of this whole doctrine in Paul&#8217;s own words 
          and expression.)&#8221; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220; &#8216;For 
          there is no distinction, as all have sinned and have need of the glory 
          of God. They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption 
          which is in Christ Jesus. (Rom. 3.22-24) </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Paul is writing 
          to oppose those Jews and Christians who saw justification as something 
          to be accomplished by a person through his own good works. In this aberration, 
          man was seen as bringing about grace as a reward or even as a salary 
          from God for good deeds done. Paul vigorously opposes this religion 
          of human self-sufficiency, denying, as we have seen, man&#8217;s power 
          to perform the good works of the Law, and constantly affirming that 
          justification is a work of God bestowed on faithful men as a free divine 
          gift. The Apostle strongly opposes a religion based on &#8216;boasting,&#8217; 
          on self-sufficiency before God. Such a religion is injurious to the 
          divine goodness and is based on an unreal view of the human condition.&#8221; 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;From its 
          genesis at the beginning of man&#8217;s life to its consummation at 
          the end, the work of man&#8217;s salvation is inseparably the gratuitous 
          gift of God and the free cooperation of man.&#8221; </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then there are the 
        canons of the Council of Trent. In 1547 the Church convened to issue a 
        proclamation on justification in order to counter the Reformation theology. 
        In Canon 1 the Catholic council declared:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;If anyone 
          says that man can be justified before God by his own works, whether 
          done by his own natural powers or through the teaching of the law, without 
          divine grace through Jesus Christ, let him be anathema.&#8221; </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Canon 3 appears to 
        be very evangelical also:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;If anyone 
          says that without the predisposing inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and 
          without His help, man can believe, hope, love or be repentant as he 
          ought, so that the grace of justification may be bestowed upon Him, 
          let him be anathema.&#8221; </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his <em>Doctrinal 
        Catechism</em>, Stephen Keenan makes this startling presentation:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Q. What justification?<br>
          A. It is a grace which makes us friends of God.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. Can a sinner 
          merit this justifying grace?<br>
          A. No, he cannot; because all the good works which the sinner performs 
          whilst he is in a state of mortal sin, are dead works, which have no 
          merit sufficient to justify.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. Is it an article 
          of the Catholic faith, that the sinner, in mortal sin, cannot merit 
          the grace of justification?<br>
          A. Yes; it is decreed in the seventh chap. of the sixth session of 
          the Council of Trent, that neither faith, nor good works preceding justification, 
          can merit the grace of justification.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. How then is the 
          sinner justified?<br>
          A. He is justified gratuitously by the pure mercy of God, not on account 
          of his own or any human merit, but purely through the merits of Jesus 
          Christ; for Jesus Christ is our only mediator of redemption, who alone, 
          by his passion and death, has reconciled us to his Father.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. Why then do Protestants 
          charge us with believing that the sinner can merit the remission of 
          his sins?<br>
          A. Their ignorance of the Catholic doctrine is the cause of this, as 
          well as many other false charges.&#8221;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Catholic 
        Concept of Justification</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now let us look at 
        Rome&#8217;s doctrine of justification. In the words of its own apologists, 
        the Roman doctrine of justification is &#8220;the heart of Catholic teaching.&#8221; 
        Without question, the Church teaches that justification is by an act of 
        God&#8217;s grace. Stephen Keenan has a point when he says that Protestants 
        often show their ignorance of Catholic doctrine. The Church does not teach, 
        and never has officially taught, that justification is anything else than 
        God&#8217;s gracious act. Those who imagine that Catholic theologians 
        teach a bald righteousness by man&#8217;s own works, are not prepared 
        to meet or recognize the doctrine of the mystery of iniquity.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In brief, Catholicism 
        teaches that justification is God&#8217;s renovating act within man. Without 
        this new birth, or regenerating act of the Holy Spirit, the Church declares 
        that sinners can never be justified.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Council of Trent 
        declared:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220; . . . if 
          they [men] were not born again in Christ, they would never be justified, 
          since in that new birth there is bestowed upon them, through the merit 
          of His passion, the grace by which they are made just . . . &#8220; 
          </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The editors of the 
        Roman Catholic Douay Version make these footnote comments on Romans 3 
        and 4:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The justification 
          of which St. Paul here speaks is the infusion of sanctifying grace which 
          alone renders a person supernaturally pleasing in the sight of God.&#8221; 
          &#8220;But justification, that is, an infusion of sanctifying grace, 
          cannot be merited by us; it is an entirely gratuitous gift of God.&#8221; 
          </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And P. Gregory Stevens 
        writes the following in <em>The Life of Grace</em>:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;What is the 
          reality of the justification accorded by God when man cooperates in 
          faith? Is it merely like a statement of God declaring the sinner just? 
          Or is it a divine act by which the sinner is internally transformed 
          and becomes a new reality before God? Catholic thought has always been 
          that the justice bestowed on man is a gratuitous gift (Gal. 3.6ff), 
          and a true justice which actually transforms man into a person pleasing 
          to God.&#8221; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Catholic 
          doctrine on these questions, formulated in opposition to Lutheranism, 
          was presented in full at the Council of Trent, as it had been previously 
          by Pope Leo X in the Bull &#8216;Exsurge Domine&#8217; of June 15, 1520. 
          The teaching of Trent centers on two points of fundamental importance 
          for the understanding of the Catholic doctrine on grace. First of all, 
          justification is a real and profound transformation of man, a genuine 
          gift of sanctification to him. It can in no way be reduced to something 
          purely external.&#8221;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;In a clear, 
          religiously profound statement the Council defines the inner nature 
          and structure of justification. It does so in direct opposition to the 
          extrinsecist position of Reformation theology. The heart of Catholic 
          teaching is contained in this passage. First of all comes the assertion 
          that &#8220;justification is not only the remission of sins, but sanctification 
          and renovation of the interior man through the voluntary reception of 
          grace and the gifts, whereby man becomes just instead of unjust, a friend 
          instead of an enemy, that he may be an heir in the hope of life everlasting.&#8221; 
          The Council then details the causes of this inner transformation: its 
          goal and purpose is God&#8217;s glory; it is brought about by God through 
          the merits of our Redeemer, and communicated to man in faith and baptism.&#8221;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Summary and 
        Conclusion</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Catholic doctrine 
        of justification may be accurately summarized as follows:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justification

        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">2.</font></strong> Justification 
          comes by an infusion of God&#8217;s grace. Man is justified on the basis 
          of what the Holy Spirit has done in him.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">3. </font></strong>Justification 
          means that man himself is made just, made pleasing to God in his own 
          person.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In practical terms, 
        Catholic justification may be expressed this way: &#8220;Here is a sinner, 
        vile and wicked. God&#8217;s grace acting within him changes him into 
        a person pleasing to God. By this grace acting within him, he is justified 
        before God.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A devout Catholic 
        may say: &#8220;Righteousness by faith means that I cannot save myself, 
        but by faith I can receive God&#8217;s transforming grace. His grace can 
        change my heart, and by His grace in my heart I can be acceptable in His 
        sight.&#8221; Or to use the words of Jean Daujat (<em>The Theology of 
        Grace</em>): </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Sinful man 
          cannot, of himself, be pleasing to God. For that, he must receive a 
          gift from God which transforms him interiorly, cleanses him and sanctifies 
          him by adorning him with qualities that render him pleasing to his Creator.&#8221;

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The foregoing is a 
        faithful reflection of Romanism, not only presented after a careful research 
        in Catholic literature, but also personally verified with theologians 
        from that Church. If you honestly cannot see much wrong with the doctrine 
        set forth in the preceding material, then, dear friend, it is because 
        you have been a good Catholic without knowing it. We do not say this to 
        offend. Romanism is merely the religion of human nature, and we are all 
        human. Unless we are anointed with the Spirit of divine enlightenment, 
      we are bound to be confused with the doctrine of the mystery of iniquity.</font></p>
