            <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christian doctrine has two poles: </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">1.</font></strong> &#8220;in Christ&#8221; and<br>
        <strong><font size="5">2. </font></strong><font size="3">&#8220;Christ in you.&#8221; </font></font></p>      
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <p><font size="3">Or we can express it this way:</font></p>
      </font>      <p><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1.</strong></font><strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Christ&#8217;s work <em>for us.</em> (His sinless life and atoning death on the cross) <br>
          <strong><font size="5">2. </font></strong>Christ&#8217;s work<em> in us. </em>(The Holy Spirit's work of convicting us of sin and leading us to repentance towards God and faith in the finished work of Christ on the cross) </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <p><font size="3">In the matter of justification, we must never confuse 
        these two aspects of redemption. </font></p>
      </font>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Number 1 we mean the doing (His sinless 
        life) and dying (His atoning death) of Christ <em>for us. </em>This is the <em>meritorious</em> cause of our acceptance with God. </font></p>
      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Number 2 we mean the work that the 
        Holy Spirit does <em>in the believer&#8217;s heart</em> (repentance towards God and faith in the blood of Christ). This is the <em>instrumental</em> means of our acceptance with God. </font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <p><font size="3">The Reformers maintained the Pauline position that we 
        are justified <em>solely</em> on the meritorious basis of Number 1 &#8211; Christ&#8217;s 
        work <em>for us </em>as the meritorious cause of a sinner's acceptance with God<em>.</em></font></p>
      </font>      <p><strong><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Number 2&nbsp;&#8212; </font></strong><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Justified by <em>Faith </em>(the <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.org/Bible/meritoriouscause.html" target="_blank">&quot;Instrumental&quot;</a> Means of Justification) </strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God&#8217;s finished redemptive 
            act at the cross has already made provision for the salvation of all men in the Person of Christ. The empty tomb is the seal to Christ&#8217;s perfect atonement 
            for all sin. In Christ the atonement for the sin of all  the world has  been accomplished (the meritorious or objective 
            basis of acceptance with God). This means that in order to <em>receive</em> the blessing of justification <em>personally</em>, the  sinner has only to <em>personally</em> repent of his sins and trust  in Christ as his Savior and Lord (the instrumental or subjective basis of acceptance with God). </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore we conclude 
                  that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. Rom. 3:28.</font></p>
        <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house, testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of <strong>repentance to God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ</strong>. Acts 20:20-21</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&quot;  Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, &quot;Men and brethren, what shall we do?&quot; Then Peter said to them, &quot;<strong>Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins</strong>; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. &quot;For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.&quot; And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, &quot;Be saved from this perverse generation.&quot; Acts 2:36-40</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   &quot;But those things which God foretold by the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled. &quot;<strong>Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out</strong>, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, &quot;and that He may send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you before, &quot;whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began. &quot;For Moses truly said to the fathers, 'The LORD your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brethren. Him you shall hear in all things, whatever He says to you.  'And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.' Acts 3:18-23</font></p>
      </blockquote>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;
      </font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;By faith without works &#8221;  became 
        the slogan and war cry of the Reformation. By this the Reformers meant that 
        nothing else was required for justification save that a repentant sinner trust only in 
        what God had done for him in Christ on the cross of Calvary. In this context, they saw that when they put their trust in Christ's blood alone God forgives and accepts them as an adopted child of God and an heir of eternal life.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The papists were willing to concede that a man could be 
        justified by faith if that faith were clothed with love. But since love 
        is the fulfilling of the law, the Reformers recognized that the papal 
        view was a veiled attempt to support righteousness by the fulfillment 
        of law. Hence Protestantism insisted on <em>sola fide</em>, for they correctly saw that love 
        and good works of obedience are the<em> fruit</em> in man&#8217;s experience of <em>sanctification</em> but not the <em>root</em> of ones acceptance with God in <em>justification</em>. According 
        to Romans 5:1-6, love is the <em>fruit</em> of justification.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  Therefore, since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.   Through Him we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in our hope of sharing the glory of God.   More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,   and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,   and hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us.   While we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. Romans 5:1-6</font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="5"><strong>Number 3 &#8212; Justified<em>        by</em> <em>Imputed</em> <em>Righteousness.</em></strong></font> </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Reformers merely re-emphasized 
            the clear teaching of Paul, especially as set forth in Romans 4. In this 
            chapter the words translated &#8220;accounted,&#8221; &#8220;reckoned&#8221; 
        and &#8220;imputed&#8221; all come from the same Greek word. </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&#8220;For 
          what saith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was <strong>counted</strong> unto 
          him for righteousness.&#8221; Verse 3.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;But to him 
          that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, 
          his faith is <strong>counted</strong> for righteousness. Even as David also describeth 
          the blessedness of the man, unto whom God <strong>imputeth</strong> righteousness without 
          works. &#8230;Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, 
          or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was <strong>reckoned</strong>          to Abraham for righteousness.&#8221; Verses 5, 6, 9.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;... and [Abraham] 
          being fully persuaded that, what He [God] had promised, He was able 
          also to perform. And therefore it was <strong>imputed</strong> to him for righteousness. 
          Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was <strong>imputed</strong> to him; 
          but for us also, to whom it shall be <strong>imputed</strong>, if we believe on Him that 
          raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.&#8221; Verses 21-24.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p><font size="3">The word &#8220;impute&#8221; means that the righteousness 
        by which we are justified is <em>outside</em> of us. Instead of being poured into 
        us, as the Catholics teach, the sinless perfect life of Christ is <em>credited</em>, 
        or <em>accounted</em>, to the believer in Jesus. The <em>Concise Oxford Dictionary</em> 
        gives both the Protestant and Catholic definitions of justification as 
        follows:</font></p>
      </font>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&#8220;<strong>justify</strong> 
          . . . (Theol.) declare (person) free from the penalty of sin on the ground of 
          Christ&#8217;s righteousness or (Rom. Cath.) of the infusion of grace 
          ...&#8221;</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <p><font size="3">The Roman Catholic Council of Trent pronounced a curse on anyone who 
        would teach that justification comes &#8220;through the imputation of 
        Christ&#8217;s righteousness alone.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">There is full assurance and freedom in the truth. Justification on the basis of a righteousness wholly <em>outside</em> of us means that we do not have to look 
        <em>within</em> our own hearts to see a certain amount of <em>infused</em> righteousness. 
        Rather, we go to Christ <em>just as we are</em>, realizing that in our Substitute 
        there is righteousness enough to give us favor and right standing with 
        God.</font></p>
      </font>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="5"><strong>Number 4&nbsp;&#8212;  Justification Means Being 
              <em>Accounted</em> and <em>Declared</em> Righteous.</strong></font> </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Roman 
            Church contended that &#8220;justification&#8221; means <em>making</em> a man righteous 
            <em>in his own person.</em> The Catholic reasons, &#8220;How can God pronounce 
            a man to be righteous in His sight unless he is actually righteous?&#8221; He therefore thinks that a man must be born again and transformed before 
            he can have right standing with God. In this system of thought, a man 
            can have no real assurance of justification, for he can never be sure 
            whether the Holy Spirit has made him righteous enough to be accepted of 
            God.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <p><font size="3">In contrast, the Reformation theology says with Paul, 
        &#8220;But to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth 
        the ungodly, his faith is <em>counted</em> for righteousness.&#8221; Rom. 4:5. 
        God justifies sinners, and sinners of all sorts, not on the condition 
        of any preceding righteousness, but on the condition that they personally believe 
        with their whole heart what God has done for them, namely, that He has 
         reconciled and accepted them in the person of their Substitute.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">The Reformers pointed out that the words &#8220;justify&#8221; 
        and &#8220;justification&#8221; are legal and judicial words, closely 
        related to the idea of trial and judgment (Deut. 25:1; 1 Kings 8:32; 1 
        Cor. 4:3, 4; Matt. 12:37; Rom. 3:4). The words imply a <em>declaration</em> 
        and <em>pronouncement</em> from the divine court of the 
        believer&#8217;s right standing with God. &#8220;Justification&#8221; 
        in itself does not mean a change <em>in the man</em>, but a declaration of how 
        he appears <em>in God&#8217;s sight</em>.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">Divine &#8220;justification&#8221; does not mean to actually 
        make a believer righteous as an empirical reality, but it means to <em>account</em> 
        him as righteous. And God does this for the believing sinner before he 
        has been sanctified by the Holy Spirit. Paul illustrates this from the 
        experience of Abraham:</font></p>
      </font>      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&#8220;... 
          (as it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before 
          Him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth 
        those things which <strong>be not</strong> as though <strong>they were</strong>.&#8221; Rom. 4:17.</font></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God did not pronounce Abraham a father <em>after</em> Isaac was 
            born, but while Sarah was <em>still barren</em>. By faith Abraham accepted that 
            he was a father because it was so in the Word of God rather than by empirical 
            reality. In the same way, we are to believe when the gospel tells us that 
            we repentant sinners who have called upon the name of Christ as our Savior and Lord have been <em>reckoned</em> righteous in Christ. If we stop to consider what we 
            are, faith staggers as Abraham&#8217;s faith would have staggered if he 
            had considered his own dead body and the deadness of Sarah&#8217;s womb. 
            Therefore, in justification God &#8220;calleth those things which be not 
            as though they were.&#8221;</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But the words, &quot;it was reckoned to him,&quot; were written not for his sake alone, but for ours also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in Him that raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,  who was put to death for our trespasses and raised for our justification. Romans 4:23-25 RSV </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;
      </font>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus the repentant believer is secure only in the merciful reckoning 
        of God. The Lord accounts him as having more moral worth than the angels 
        who have never sinned. But the believer knows that in himself he is not 
        as he appears before God in His exalted Substitute. Indeed, his nature 
        is still sinful, and the nearer he comes to Christ, the more sinful he 
        sees himself to be. This keeps him humble and continually contrite of heart and utterly dependent upon his 
        Substitute in whom he stands wholly righteous, wholly acceptable in the 
      sight of God.</font></p>
