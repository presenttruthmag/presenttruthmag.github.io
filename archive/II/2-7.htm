      <font size="6">&nbsp;</font><BR> <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        relationship between justification and regeneration was a major point 
        of contention between Roman Catholic theologians and the Reformers. The 
        papists said that <em>regeneration</em> and <em>penance</em> were the necessary <em>conditions</em> for justification. <em>Penance</em> being 
        


 the sinner's voluntary self-inflicted punishment  as an outward expression of repentance for having done wrong.

The Reformers taught that regeneration was the <em>fruit</em> of justification. Justification means that the repentant sinner is <em>forgiven</em> of his sins by Christ and that he is <em>reckoned</em> as sinless before God's holy Law</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&#8212;</strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christ Himself being the One who was punished for the sins of the repentant sinner. Christ is the One who did penance for our sins when He alone suffered and died for our sins on the cross of Calvary. </font></p>

        Regeneration &#8211; the immediate <em>consequence</em> and <em>fruit</em> of justification.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many souls 
        today who are not clear on the mighty doctrinal gains of the Reformation. 
        Not only do they confuse <em>justification</em> and <em>regeneration</em>, 
        but some even imagine that regeneration and transformation of character 
        must take place in the heart <em>before</em> God can justify the believer 
        in Jesus. Unless a Christian is clear on this point, it is impossible 
        to be sound in the faith. Therefore we shall examine the evidence from 
        God's Word &#8211; evidence that will clearly prove that God justifies 
        men while they are still sinners in themselves.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>According 
        to Paul</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The book of Romans 
        is the inspired thesis on justification. Here the subject is set out in 
        the most careful and logical order. Paul makes five points to show that 
        men are justified while still sinners in themselves:</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. God justifies 
        the ungodly.</strong> First Paul sets forth the truth that all men are 
        sinners. In the third chapter of Romans he declares that faith is the 
        only condition of receiving justification. Then in chapter 4 he says: 
        &quot;But to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth 
        the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.&quot; Verse 5. In 
        the original language, the word &quot;ungodly&quot; is one of the strongest 
        expressions that can be used to describe a sinner. This scripture certainly 
        contradicts the notion that God justifies only regenerate saints.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. God justifies 
        the uncircumcised.</strong> In order to illustrate that justification 
        comes on the ungodly who believe, Paul illustrates his point from the 
        example of Abraham. The father of the faithful was justified by faith 
        while he was uncircumcised.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">RSV Romans 4:9-11  Is this blessing pronounced only upon the circumcised, or also upon the uncircumcised? We say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness. 10 How then was it reckoned to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. 11 He received circumcision as a sign or seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness reckoned to them,</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the minds of the 
        Jews, uncircumcision stood for an unclean and unsanctified state. Circumcision 
        is a symbol of the new heart (Col. 2:11-13). </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Colossians 2:11-13   11 When you came to Christ, you were &quot;circumcised,&quot; but not by a physical procedure. It was a spiritual procedure -- the cutting away of your sinful nature.  For you were buried with Christ when you were baptized. And with him you were raised to a new life because you trusted the mighty power of God, who raised Christ from the dead.  You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away. Then God made you alive with Christ. He forgave all our sins. </font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the new life 
          is the <em>sign</em> and witness of the blessing of justification, not the <em>cause</em> or even the condition necessary for justification. Paul's gospel declares 
          that God justifies the ungodly, the uncircumcised and the heathen through 
          faith in Christ (Rom. 4:5, 10; Gal. 3:7-9).</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   <font size="2">Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Romans 4:4-5</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.   And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.   So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. Galatians 3:7-9</font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>3. God calls 
        the things that <em>be not </em>as though <em>they were</em>.</strong> Human wisdom will 
        question, &quot;How can God pronounce a man righteous <em>before</em> the Holy 
        Spirit has made him righteous?&quot; This is how the Catholic system reasons. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul anticipates this objection, and so he cites Abraham's experience 
          again to illustrate God's way of justification&#8212;</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.... (as it is written, 
                I have made thee a father of many nations,) before Him whom he believed, 
                even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which <strong>be not</strong>          as though <strong>they were</strong>.&quot; Rom. 4:17. </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God did not give Abraham a son and 
              then pronounce him a father. He pronounced him a father while his own 
              body and Sarah's womb were still dead (See verse 19). In the same way, 
              God pronounces the believing sinner righteous even <em>before</em> the fruit of 
              a new life is seen. He calls &quot;those things which <em>be not</em> as though 
              <em>they were</em>.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>4. The new 
        heart of peace, joy and love is the <em>consequence</em> of justification.</strong> 
        Nothing could be plainer than Romans 5:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Therefore 
          being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus 
          Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein 
          we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. . . . and hope maketh 
          not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by 
          the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.&quot; Verses 1, 2, 5.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus does Romans 5 
        begin to enumerate the fruits of being justified by faith. Nothing works 
        moral renovation like the sense of God's pardoning love. As Luther said, 
        &#8220;. . . when I learned how the sinner's justification proceeds from 
        the pure mercy of the Lord by means of faith, then I felt myself revive 
        like a new man, and entered at open doors into the very paradise of God.&quot; 
        &mdash; J.H. Merle D'Aubigne, <em>History of the Reformation in the Sixteenth 
        Century</em>, vol. 1, p.73</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="indwelling_grace"></a>5. Only the 
        justified receive the gift and infilling of the Spirit.</strong> Paul 
        speaks of two gifts &#8211; the gift of righteousness, and the gift of 
        the Spirit (Rom. 5:5, 17). </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   <font size="2">For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. Romans 5:17</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. Romans 5:5</font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Righteousness is <em>imputed</em> to give the believer 
            right standing with God; the Spirit is <em>imparted</em> to work renovation and 
            sanctification in the heart of the believer. As we have seen from Romans 
            5:1, 5, the gift of the Spirit is given to those who have been justified 
            by faith. In fact, Paul's thorough treatment of the Spirit's work is presented 
            in Romans 8 &mdash; only <em>after</em> he has thoroughly presented justification through 
            the imputation of God's righteousness. The Spirit is the witness that 
            the justified are children of God (Rom. 8:16; cf. Eph. 1:13, 14). </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  <font size="2">The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: Romans 8:16</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,   Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. Ephesians 1:13-14</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Galatians 
                the apostle declares:</font></p>      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And the Scripture, 
          foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached 
          before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be 
          blessed. So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 
          Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse 
          for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: 
          that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus 
          Christ; <strong>that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through 
          faith.</strong>&quot; Gal. 3:8, 9, 13, 14.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The apostle Peter 
        also confirms that the gift of the Spirit is given to the justified, for 
        he says, </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of 
              Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and <em>ye shall receive the gift 
              of the Holy Ghost</em>.&quot; Acts 2:38.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But those things which God foretold by the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled. &quot;Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that He may send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you before, Acts 3:18-20 </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="prevenient"></a>It is true that the 
        Spirit pleads with the hearts of all men as long as Jesus continues to 
        make intercession for the transgressors in the sanctuary above. To those 
        who respond to His drawing, the Spirit gives faith and repentance. In 
        theology this is called <strong>&quot;prevenient grace&quot;</strong>, and should not be 
        confused with the gift and infilling of the Spirit, which comes upon the 
        justified.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus men are justified 
        by faith while they are still sinners in themselves.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>According 
        to Ezekiel</strong></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Thus saith 
          the Lord God unto Jerusalem: Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land 
          of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite. And 
          as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, 
          neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted 
          at all, nor swaddled at all. None eye pitied thee, to do any of these 
          unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the 
          open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast 
          born. And when I, passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own 
          blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said 
          unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live. .. . Now when I passed 
          by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love, 
          and I spread My skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware 
          unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, 
          and thou becamest Mine. <strong>Then washed I thee with water; yea, 
          I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with 
          oil</strong>.&quot; Ezek.16:3-6, 8, 9.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What a tremendous 
        illustration of the justification of sinners by the pure mercy of God! 
        Notice how God washes and anoints with oil (the Holy Spirit) after He 
        covers the sinner with His righteousness. Commenting on this scripture, 
        John Bunyan says:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">Question: 
          </font></strong><font size="2">But how could a holy God say, &#8220;live&#8221;, 
          to such a sinful people?</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Answer:</strong> 
          Though they had nought but sin, yet he had love and righteousness. He 
          had, 1. Love to pity them; 2. Righteousness to cover them 'Now when 
          I passed by thee and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time 
          of love,' Ezek, xvi.8 what follows? 1. 'I spread my skirt over thee;' 
          and, 2, 'Covered thy nakedness;' yea, 3, 'I sware unto thee;' and, 4, 
          'Entered into covenant with thee;'and, 5, 'Thou becamest mine.' My love 
          pitied thee; my skirt covered thee. Thus God delivered them from the 
          curse in his sight. 'Then I washed thee with water (after thou wast 
          justified); yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and anointed 
          thee with oil.' verse 9. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sanctification, then, is consequential, justification 
            goes before &mdash; the Holy Ghost by this scripture setteth forth to the 
            life, free grace to the sons of men while they themselves are sinners. 
            I say, while they are unwashed, unswaddled, unsalted, but bloody sinners; 
            for by these words, 'not washed, not salted, not swaddled,' he setteth 
            forth their unsanctified state; yea, they were not only unsanctified, 
            but also cast out, without pity, to the loathing of their persons; yea, 
            'no eye pitied them, to do any of these things for them;' no eye but 
            his whose glorious grace is unsearchable; no eye but his who could look 
            and love; all others looked and loathed; but blessed be God that hath 
            passed by us in that day that we wallowed in our own blood; and blessed 
            be God for the skirt of his glorious righteousness wherewith he covered 
            us when we lay before him naked in blood. It was when we were in our 
            blood that he loved us; when we were in our blood he said, Live. Therefore, 
            men are justified from the curse in the sight of God while sinners in

      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>According 
        to the Way of Divine Forgiveness</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the glorious 
        gospel of saving grace, God forgives <em>sinners</em> rather than transformed, 
        born-again <em>saints. </em> But according to Rome, a sinner cannot be forgiven unless 
        he first becomes a <em>new creature</em>. In this way the poor sinner is unable 
        to grasp the free gift of God's pardon, for, looking to himself, he is 
        never sure if he is transformed enough for God to accept him. This was 
        the nature of the struggle in the heart of Luther as he wailed, &quot;How 
        can I know that God forgives me when there is nothing in my heart like 
        true conversion?&quot; But as soon as he grasped God's free pardon to 
        an unworthy sinner, he experienced the peace, joy and love of the regenerate 
        life. The great evil of the mystery of iniquity is in that it takes the 
        <em>fruit</em> of justification and presents that as the <em>means</em> of justification.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus' act of forgiving 
        and healing the sick of the palsy is a beautiful illustration of the relationship 
        of justification and newness of life.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When Jesus 
          saw their faith, He said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be 
          forgiven thee. But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, 
          and reasoning in their hearts, Why doth this Man thus speak blasphemies? 
          who can forgive sins but God only? And immediately when Jesus perceived 
          in His spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, He said unto 
          them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? Whether is it easier 
          to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, 
          Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? But that ye may know that the 
          Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (He saith to the sick 
          of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy 
          way into thine house. And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and 
          went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified 
          God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.&quot; Mark 2:5-12.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sick man's physical 
        restoration was the sign, or seal, of the righteousness which he had by 
        faith (cf. Rom. 4:10, 11). This miracle was an illustration of Jesus' 
        power to bring regeneration and newness of life to souls that are palsied 
        by sin. It shows that forgiveness and regeneration are never to be <em>separated</em>. 
        Yet they must not be <em>confused</em>. First the palsied man was forgiven. Then 
        he was restored to the vigor of new life. Here is an illustration of the 
        gospel. The soul palsied by sin is first forgiven, then restored to spiritual 
        soundness.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>According 
        to the Sanctuary</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As soon as the repentant 
        Hebrew stepped through the &quot;door of the court&quot; and into the 
        enclosure of the sanctuary, he found himself surrounded on all sides by 
        the white linen of the outer court. Here is an illustration of the imputed 
        righteousness of Jesus. The moment the sinner steps through the door of 
        faith and repentance, he is justified by the righteousness of God.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is significant 
        that the altar of burnt offering and the laver were within the court. 
        This teaches us that the blessings of the covenant are found only in Christ. 
        None are found outside. Sinners must run into Christ before anything else. 
        If God wanted to show us that we must be free from sin before we run into 
        Christ, He would have instructed Moses to put the altar and laver outside 
        the court. This is what people do when they teach that men must experience 
        regeneration before God can cover them with His righteousness.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>According 
        to the Reformers</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Reformers were 
        not without fault in their understanding of truth. But God gave them the 
        light on justification by faith, and despite differences that existed 
        among some of them on certain points, they were all united on justification, 
        the foundation of the Protestant Reformation. They gave united witness 
        to the truth that God justifies men while they are still sinners in themselves.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Andrew Osiander broke 
        from Luther and the Reformation position on justification. He confounded 
        justification and regeneration, and contended that men are made righteous 
        before God by the indwelling of Christ. The Reformers recognized that Osiander's doctrine constituted 
        a return, in principle, to the doctrine of Romanism. In his <em>Institutes 
        of the Christian Religion</em>, John Calvin devoted a section to refute 
        Osiander's theology. Among other things, he said:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em><font size="2">&quot;6. 
          Osiander erroneously mixes forgiveness of sins with rebirth.&quot;</font></em></strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;To prove the 
          first point &mdash; that God justifies not only by pardoning but by regenerating 
          &mdash; he asks whether God leaves as they were by nature those whom he justified, 
          changing none of their vices. This is exceedingly easy to answer&#8212; as 
          Christ cannot be torn into parts, so these two which we perceive in 
          him together and conjointly are inseparable &mdash; namely, righteousness 
          and sanctification. Whomever, therefore, God receives into grace, on 
          them he at the same time bestows the spirit of adoption [Rom. 8:15], 
          by whose power he remakes them to his own image. But if the brightness 
          of the sun cannot be separated from its heat, shall we therefore say 
          that the earth is warmed by its light, or lighted by its heat? Is there 
          anything more applicable to the present matter than this comparison? 
          The sun, by its heat, quickens and fructifies the earth, by its beams 
          brightens and illumines it. Here is a mutual and indivisible connection. 
          Yet reason itself forbids us to transfer the peculiar qualities of the 
          one to the other. In this confusion of the two kinds of grace that Osiander 
          forces upon us there is a like absurdity. For since God, for the preservation 
          of righteousness, renews those whom he freely reckons as righteous, 
          Osiander mixes that gift of regeneration with this free acceptance and 
          contends that they are one and the same. Yet Scripture, even though 
          it joins them, still lists them separately in order that God's manifold 
          grace may better appear to us. For Paul's statement is not redundant: 
          that Christ was given to us for our righteousness and sanctification 
          [1 Cor. 1:30]. And whenever he reasons &mdash; from the salvation purchased 
          for us, from God's fatherly love, and from Christ's grace that we are 
          called to holiness and cleanness, he clearly indicates that to be justified 
          means something different from being made new creatures.&quot; </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Wesley was noted 
        for his great emphasis on holiness of life; yet he stood decidedly with 
        the Reformers on the true relation of justification and regeneration. 
        Said Wesley:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If any doctrines 
          within the whole compass of Christianity may be properly termed fundamental, 
          they are doubtless these two; the doctrine of justification, and that 
          of the new birth: the former relating to that great work which God does 
          for us, in forgiving our sins; the latter, to the great work which God 
          does in us, in renewing our fallen nature. In order of time, neither 
          of these is before the other; in the moment we are justified by the 
          grace of God, through the redemption that is in Jesus, we are also 'born 
          of the Spirit;' but in order of thinking as it is termed, justification 
          precedes the new birth. We first conceive  His wrath to be turned away, 
          and then his Spirit to work in our hearts.&quot; <em>Sermons on Several 
          Occasions</em>, sermon 45, &quot;The New Birth.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unless Wesley was 
        clear on this matter of justification, he could not have preached for 
        the conversion of thousands of sinners. See how he concluded a powerful 
        sermon on justification:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Thou ungodly 
          one, who hearest or readest these words, thou vile, helpless, miserable 
          sinner, I charge thee before God, the Judge of all, go straight unto 
          him, with all thy ungodliness. Take heed thou destroy not thy own soul 
          by pleading thy righteousness more or less. Go as altogether ungodly, 
          guilty, lost, destroyed, deserving and dropping into hell; and thou 
          shalt then find favour in his sight, and know that he justifieth the 
          ungodly. As such thou shalt be brought unto the blood of sprinkling, 
          as an undone, helpless, damned sinner. Thus look unto Jesus! There is 
          the Lamb of God, who taketh away thy sins! Plead thou no works, no righteousness 
          of thine own! No humility, contrition, sincerity! In no wise. That were, 
          in very deed, to deny the Lord that bought thee. No; plead thou, singly, 
          the blood of the covenant, the ransom paid for thy proud, stubborn, 
          sinful soul. Who art thou, that now seest and feelest both thine inward 
          and outward ungodliness? Thou art the man! I want thee for my Lord! 
          I challenge thee for a child of God by faith! The Lord hath need of 
          thee. Thou who feelest thou art just fit for hell, art just fit to advance 
          his glory; the glory of his free grace, justifying the ungodly and him 
          that worketh not. Oh come quickly! Believe in the Lord Jesus; and thou, 
          even thou, art reconciled to God.&quot; <em>Ibid.</em>, sermon 5, &quot;Justification 
          by Faith.&quot;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is freedom and 
        power, as well as a wealth of comfort, in the truth. We need to know that 
        God justifies sinners who believe His gospel message. But if we once accept 
        the devil's premise that God will justify us on the basis of some inward 
        righteousness, faith totters, and the soul falls into uncertainty and 
        despair. Those who would teach that regeneration must precede justification 
        do dig ditches in the path to Christ that neither themselves nor poor 
        sinners who heed them can ever get across. But in the light of the gospel, 
        the conviction of our utter sinfulness need not drive us to despair. Indeed, 
        such conviction prepares us for the comfort of the gospel. The fact that 
        we are sinners entitles us to come to Christ. We may come just as we are 
        and, throwing ourselves in all our unworthiness entirely upon His mercy, 
        may grasp the promise: </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But to him 
          that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, 
          his faith is counted for righteousness.&quot; Rom. 4:5. </font></blockquote>
