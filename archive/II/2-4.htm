                              <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The real difference between Rome and the Reformation was in fundamental emphasis. In Romanism the meritorious cause is essentially subjective &#8211; it is man-centered, experience-centered. In the Reformation the meritorious cause was objective &#8211; it was Christ-centered as focusing upon His sinless life and atoning death on the cross.</font> </p>
                              <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The focal point of Catholic theology is God&#8217;s work of grace <em>within</em> human experience.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is why it is so devastating to Christian freedom. Man is a prisoner because his own experience has become the center of his concern.</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Catholic doctrine 
          adds despair to grief by basing a man&#8217;s standing with God on what 
          grace does within him.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If a man&#8217;s acceptance 
        and right standing with God depend upon God&#8217;s grace within his own 
        heart, then he must ask himself, &#8220;How much grace must I have operative 
        in me before I can stand justified before God? How prayerful, repentant, 
        loving or obedient must grace make me before God can accept me?&#8221; 
        This was the problem that confronted that devout Augustinian monk, Martin 
        Luther. While he based his right standing with God on God&#8217;s work 
        of grace in his heart, he could never be sure that he had enough of God&#8217;s 
        grace in his heart. In fact, the more he looked within his own experience 
        to find a basis of his acceptance with God, the more he was tormented 
        by the sight of his own sinfulness.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then came the enlightenment 
        of the gospel in the rediscovery of Paul&#8217;s doctrine of justification. 
        Says the apostle: &#8220;. . . being justified freely by His grace through 
        the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Rom. 3:24. The New English 
        Bible translates the passage: &#8220;. . . all are justified by God&#8217;s 
        free grace alone, through His act of liberation in the person of Christ 
        Jesus.&#8221; This shows us that rather than being justified on the basis what God 
        does <em>within</em> us, we are justified on the basis what God did altogether <em>outside</em> of 
        us. God accomplished His act of liberation for all men in Jesus Christ. 
        Here is the dividing of the way between Rome and the Reformation. Rome 
        declares that a man is justified by God&#8217;s work of grace <em>in his heart</em>. 
        The Reformation declares that a man is justified on the basis of God&#8217;s work of 
        grace <em>in Jesus Christ </em>alone<em>.</em></font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Christ, Our 
        Everlasting Father</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How did we become 
        sinners before God? The answer to this question throws great light on 
        the vital question, How do we become righteous before God?</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul&#8217;s doctrine 
        is this: We did not become sinners before God by something that happened 
          <em>within</em> us. We became sinners because of something that happened outside 
        of us, in another person altogether. &#8220;By one man&#8217;s disobedience 
        many were made sinners.&#8221; Rom. 5:19. Adam was our first father. He 
        stood as our federal head. The whole human family was constituted in him. 
        When he fell, it was the same as if every man had fallen. This is Paul&#8217;s 
        argument in Romans 5:15-19: One man&#8217;s offence brought death and 
        condemnation upon many. Other translations read &#8220;the many,&#8221; 
        &#8220;the whole race.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tragedy of the 
        fall and condemnation of the whole human race in Adam was the outworking 
        of the law of fatherhood. Children share the lot of the father. The Canaanite 
        children were destroyed along with their parents. Achan&#8217;s family 
        died because of the father&#8217;s covetousness. Even in secular life, 
        if a wealthy father loses his property in business reverses, the children 
        are made poor in their father&#8217;s poverty.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Satan rejoiced at 
        the fall of Adam &#8212; rejoiced because he won the whole human race 
        when Adam fell into sin. Now if Satan could cause the condemnation of all men in one man, 
        could not God do the same thing in one Man? Indeed, this was the gospel 
        mystery that took the devil by surprise. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God reversed the fall 
        of Adam by providing and offering the human race with another Father, as it is written, &#8220;For 
        unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the government shall 
        be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, 
        The Mighty God, <em>The Everlasting Father, </em>The 
        Prince of Peace.&#8221; Isa. 9:6. We do not generally think of Christ 
        as being our Father, but this is exactly as Paul presents Him who became 
        &#8220;the second Adam.&#8221; God gave His only-begotten Son to be the <em>Everlasting Father </em>for all who believe and call upon His name for the forgiveness of their sins. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just as the whole 
        race was lost in Adam, God has provided and offered redemption for all humanity in His Son. 
        Jesus has become the new Head, the Representative, the Father for all repentant sinners who believe. Christ has become the new head of the believing community called the Church. </font></p>

          the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children 
          would be unclean, but now they are holy.&#8221;</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even in secular life, 
        children participate in the happy fortune of the father. If he comes into 
        possession of great wealth, the children rejoice, exclaiming, &#8220;We 
        are rich!&#8221; If he buys a shiny new automobile, the children say, 
        &#8220;We have a new car.&#8221; And they say all this as if it is their 
        perfect right (as indeed it is), even though it was entirely their father&#8217;s 
        work without their help, that procured it all.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Jesus became 
        the new Father for all who trust in Him as their Savior and Lord, He undertook the responsibility of keeping the law of 
        God perfectly for us. As our Head and Representative, He rendered to the 
        Law an obedience that in every way measured with its infinite claims. 
        We must see that before God and the bar of eternal justice, Christ stands 
        as the representative for every sinner who believes and repents of his sins. All of fallen humanity is offered redemption in Him. Thus His 
        obedience can be  every man&#8217;s obedience who has faith in His blood. It was the same as if every 
        believer had personally kept the Law of God with the same infinite perfection 
        as Jesus Christ. So Paul says, &#8220;For as by one man&#8217;s disobedience 
        many [literally, the many, i.e., the whole race) were made [or constituted] 
        sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many [the many) be made righteous.&#8221; 
        Rom. 5:19. Paul in this epistle to the Romans is addressing the believing community with these words of comfort and assurance that all who trust in Christ &quot;shall be made (declared) righteous&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus it is forever 
        settled that only by the perfect obedience rendered personally by Jesus Christ, the believing repentant sinner is reckoned righteous in the sight of God. Just as we were made sinners by an act 
        of disobedience outside of us, so we who believe are given right standing with God 
        by an obedience outside of us &#8211; even by the personal doing and dying of Jesus 
        Christ.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christ&#8217;s obedience 
        was more than His holy living. It included His obedience unto death, even 
        the death of the cross (Phil. 2:8). </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Philippians 2:8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. </font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Christ consented to become our 
            Father, He assumed the debt  for all our delinquencies. For instance, 
            if children damage your property, you seek justice by dealing with their 
            father. You may rightfully ask him to pay for all the damage done by his 
            children.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What love caused Christ 
        to become our Father, and thus to assume the full extent of our debt! 
        As Luther put it:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Our most 
          merciful Father, seeing us to be oppressed and overwhelmed with the 
          curse of the law, and so to be holden under the same that we could never 
          be delivered from it by our own power, sent His Son into the world and 
          laid upon Him all the sins of all men, saying: Be thou Peter that denier; 
          Paul that persecutor, blasphemer, and cruel oppressor; David that adulterer; 
          that sinner Adam which did eat the apple in Paradise; that thief that hanged 
          upon the cross; and briefly, be thou the Person which hath committed 
          the sins of all men; see therefore that thou pay and satisfy for them. 
          Here now cometh the Law and saith: I find Him a sinner, and that such 
          an one as hath taken upon Him the sins of all men, and I see no sins 
          but in Him. Therefore let Him die upon the cross. And so he setteth 
          upon Him and killeth Him. By this means the whole world is purged and 
          cleansed from all sins, and so delivered from death and all evils. Now 
          sin and death being abolished by this one man, God would see nothing 
          else in the whole world, <u>especially if it did believe</u>, but a mere cleansing 
          and righteousness.&#8221;&mdash;<em>Commentary on Galatians</em>, p.272.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The apostle Paul declares, 
        &#8220;For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, 
        that if One died for all, then were all dead.&#8221; 2 Cor. 5:14. By this 
        precious statement, the apostle declares that even though all the world is dead in sin, Christ's atoning death on the cross is freely offered as the atoning sacrifice for the whole world..</font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christ&#8217;s victory 
        can be reckoned as every man&#8217;s victory if he will but believe and accept it. Christ

      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Justification by Faith in a Righteousness Outside of Us in Christ </strong><font size="3"></font></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gospel is the 
        good news of what God has done for all men in Jesus Christ if they will but believe. He has accomplished 
        the believer's act of liberation in the Person of His Son. While we were ungodly, 
        without strength, and enemies in our minds by wicked works, God wrought 
        out our complete salvation in our great Head. He placed our sins upon 
        Christ, punished them in Christ and put them away by Christ. So Paul declares to the believing community at Rome, 
        &#8220;&#8230;[He] was delivered for our offences, and was raised again 
        for our justification.&#8221; Rom. 4:25.  This means 
        that the resurrection of Jesus from the dead was God&#8217;s witness that 
        He had provided payment of the debt of all men in Jesus Christ. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Addressing the Christian community at Colossi Paul assures them: </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Colossians 2:13-14 13 You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away. Then God made you alive with Christ. He forgave all our sins. 14 He canceled the record that contained the charges against us. He took it and destroyed it by nailing it to Christ's cross. NLT </font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If there were one sin left for 
            which atonement had not been made, if there were one transgression for 
            which Christ had not made full satisfaction. He would still be a prisoner 
            in Joseph&#8217;s tomb. But the gospel proclaims, &#8220;Christ is risen! 
            The tomb is empty! God has redeemed you from all sin in Christ!&#8221; This is why the resurrection was the dynamic of the apostolic message.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then in the fifth 
        chapter of Romans, Paul continues, &#8220;Therefore as by the offence 
        of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness 
        of One the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.&#8221; 
        Rom. 5:18.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The resurrection is 
        the witness that in Jesus Christ justification has been provided for the entire human family. 
        Liberation and redemption are accomplished realities in Jesus 
        Christ. For if we can confess that we were made sinners by the disobedience 
        of our first father, how &#8220;much more&#8221; (to use Paul&#8217;s 
        expression) should we now by faith confess that God has declared us righteous and accepted 
        in the Beloved. When Jesus ascended to heaven, He ascended as the believer's Representative. 
        It was the same as if we had gone into heaven. Did God receive Him? He 
        received Him with great joy. He glorified Him with glory impossible to 
        describe. He seated Him on His right hand far above the angels. But we 
        must see that all this was done for humanity if it will but believe the report. As Isaiah 53:1 asks &quot;Who has believed our report?&quot; It was the same as if God 
        had already done this for all of us. In Christ provision has been made for all humanity to be not only pardoned 
        but promoted, not only justified but glorified. Access to this &quot;peace with God&quot; is granted to all who believe the gospel message by faith  in Jesus Christ. </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore being justified by faith, we have <strong>peace with God</strong> through our Lord Jesus Christ:  By whom also <strong>we have access by faith into this grace</strong> wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Romans 5:1-2</font></p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the good news 
        of the gospel. It is good news for poor, struggling sinners. They need 
        no longer look within their own experience for anything on which to base 
        their hope of acceptance with God. God has already provided reconciiation  to Himself for the whole 
        rebellious world in the death of Jesus Christ. As surely as 
        Jesus has been given to every lost sinner, just so surely has pardon and 
        justification been provided for all men by God&#8217;s gracious Gift. Every 
        repentant sinner may respond to the gospel in faith and full assurance, saying, &#8220;In the Lord have I righteousness 
        and strength.&#8221; Isa. 45:24.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The declaration of 
        what God has done in the uplifted Christ creates faith in the heart of 
        a sinner. And it is by faith in the sinless life and atoning death of Christ that every repentant sinner may personally know the forgiveness of his sins.   In Christ he has peace with God and the assurance  of right standing with 
        God on the basis of what His grace has already done for all men in Jesus Christ.    </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are made right in God's sight when we trust in Jesus Christ to take away our sins. And we all can be saved in this same way, no matter who we are or what we have done.   For all have sinned; all fall short of God's glorious standard.  Yet now God in his gracious kindness declares us not guilty. He has done this through Christ Jesus, who has freed us by taking away our sins.   For God sent Jesus to take the punishment for our sins and to satisfy God's anger against us. We are made right with God when we believe that Jesus shed his blood, sacrificing his life for us.
