      <p><font size="3">We are living in a time when the real distinction between 
        Catholicism and Protestantism means very little in the minds of most people. 
        If the real difference is only sentiment and prejudices as it is in the case 
        of most Catholics and Protestants &#8211; we could well afford to demolish 
        what little remains of the wall of separation.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">The vast majority of Catholics and Protestants do not 
        know the real difference between Roman and Reformation doctrine. In fact, 
        the vast majority of Protestants are quite Catholic in their religious 
        outlook without knowing it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">A church historian has said: &#8220;You can compromise 
        about different doctrines; you cannot compromise about different religions. 
        Either you have a Protestant relation to God or you have the Catholic, 
        but you cannot have both; you cannot make a compromise. *</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">Yet churchmen are now talking of compromise! Dialogue 
        with Rome is the fashion with many of the Protestant bodies. Some theologians 
        are even saying that the central Reformation doctrine of justification 
        by faith is no longer a barrier to prevent union with Rome.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">The central issue of the Reformation of the sixteenth 
        century was justification by faith. Luther stated many times that if this 
        article of justification is lost, everything is lost. This issue of <em>Present 
        Truth Magazine</em> defines the vital contrast between Roman and Reformation doctrine, 
        and illustrates why no compromise is ever possible between the two streams 
        of thought. The studies herein presented were given by the editor in a 
        recent lecture tour of North America.</font></p>
