          God</em> and <em>before our fellow men</em> are not the same. Before God we are justified 
          by faith <em>without works</em> (Rom. 3:28; 4:5, 6). Before men we are justified 
          <em>by works</em> and not by faith only (James 2:24). As soon as the repentant sinner accepts 
          Christ by faith, his name is inscribed in the Lamb's book of life &mdash; he is 
          registered as a member of the church universal. But in order to join the 
          church on earth, something more than faith is required. He must show his 
          faith by his works. Before heaven he is justified <em>by faith</em>. Before men he 
          is justified <em>by works</em>. </font> 
        </p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
      <p><font size="3">Failure to understand the difference between justification 
        before God and man has occasioned much misunderstanding over the interpretation 
        of Paul and James. Paul declares that man is justified by faith. James 
        says he is justified by works. Unless we understand that one is speaking 
        of justification before God, and the other of justification before men, 
        James would appear to flatly contradict Paul. But they were writing about 
        different issues. Paul is concerned with the question, &quot;How should 
        man be just with God?&quot; In Romans 3 he says that the whole world stands 
        guilty &quot;before God,&quot; and that by works no man can be &quot;justified 
        in His sight&quot; (Verses 19, 20). Then in the next chapter he continues, 
        &quot;If Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but 
        not before God.&quot; Rom. 4:2. It is therefore clear that Paul is dealing 
        with justification &quot;before God&quot; &mdash; right standing &quot;in His 
        sight.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">James addresses himself to another problem. Here were 
        professed believers hearing the Word without doing it. They were failing 
        to bring forth the fruit of practical godliness. This was revealed in 
        their attitude to their fellow men. So the apostle declared:</font></p>
      </font>      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;What 
          doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have 
          not works? Can faith save him? If a brother or sister be naked, and 
          destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, 
          be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things 
          which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? Even so faith, if 
          it hath not works, is dead, being alone. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast 
          faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works, and I will 
          shew thee my faith by my works.&quot; James 2:14-18.</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp; 
      </font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notice that James is dealing with the matter of <em>showing</em>        his faith:&quot; . . . I will show thee my faith by my works.&quot; If 
        &quot;faith&quot; yields no fruit, it is not faith at all, but a counterfeit. 
        So James continues:</font></p>
       <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;Thou 
          believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, 
          and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works 
          is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had 
          offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith wrought with 
          his works, and by works was faith made perfect? And the scripture was 
          fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto 
          him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. Ye see then 
          how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.&quot; James 
          2:19-24.</font></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <p><font size="3">In his justification with God, Abraham believed God, and 
        that was counted unto him for righteousness. But how do we know that his 
        faith was genuine? How do we know that God's way of making men righteous 
        in His sight is genuine? Abraham's life of implicit obedience proves this. 
        It requires faith to obey God in all things.</font></p>
      </font> <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Writing on the 
      problem of Paul and James, Luther declared:</font> <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Insist on 
          it, then, that inwardly, in the spirit, before God, man is justified 
          through faith alone, without all work. But outwardly and publicly, before 
          the people and himself, he is justified through works, that is, he thereby 
          becomes known and certain himself that he honestly believes and is pious. 
          Therefore you may call the one a <em>public</em> justification, and the other 
          an <em>inward</em> justification, but in this sense that the public justification 
          is only a fruit, a result, and a proof of the justification in the heart. 
          Accordingly, man is not justified by it before God but must previously 
          be justified before Him. Just so you may call the fruits of the tree 
          the obvious goodness of the tree, which follows and proves its inner, 
          natural goodness.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is what 
          St. James means in his Epistle when he says (2:26): 'Faith without works 
          is dead,' that is, the fact that works do not follow is a certain sign 
          that there is no faith, but a dead thought and dream, which people falsely 
          call faith.&quot; &mdash;<em>What Luther Says</em>, vol.3, pp.1231, 1232.

      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Paul Justified 
        by Works Before Men</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul also knew that 
        before men he was justified by his works. He frequently justified himself 
        before the churches by recounting his works. To answer his critics, he 
        magnified his office of apostleship and vindicated his course of action. 
        In this manner of justification, Paul did not talk of his faith, but he 
        talked of his works. To the Thessalonian believers he wrote:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For our exhortation 
          was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile: but as we were 
          allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; 
          not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts. For neither at 
          any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; 
          God is witness: nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet 
          of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ. 
          But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children: 
          so being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted 
          unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because 
          ye were dear unto us. For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: 
          for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto 
          any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God. Ye are witnesses 
          and God also, how holily and justly and unblamably we behaved ourselves 
          among you that believe.&quot; 1 Thess. 2:3-10.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus was the apostle 
        justified by his works before the Thessalonians. Then, to answer his critics 
        at Corinth, he wrote:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Seeing that 
          many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. For ye suffer fools gladly, 
          seeing ye yourselves are wise. For ye suffer, if a man bring you into 
          bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, 
          if a man smite you on the face. I speak as concerning reproach, as though 
          we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) 
          I am bold also. Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am 
          I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. Are they ministers of Christ? 
          (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors, more abundant, in stripes 
          above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews 
          five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with 
          rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a 
          day I have been in the deep; in journeyings often, in perils of waters, 
          in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by 
          the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in 
          perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; in weariness and 
          painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, 
          in cold and nakedness. Beside those things that are without, that which 
          cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.&quot; 2 Cor. 11:18-28.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus was Paul justified 
        by works before the Corinthians. And in many other places, and before 
        many other people, Paul showed that he was justified by works.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>No Works Could 
        Justify Before God</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When arraigned before 
        his judges and accusers, Paul protested that he had done nothing worthy 
        of death. He said that his conscience was void of offence toward God and 
        toward men (Acts 24:16;25:11). But this was never his plea before God. 
        His blameless life and holy ministry were not the basis of his right standing 
        before God. So he declared: &quot;I am not aware of anything against myself, 
        but I am not there by acquitted [justified &mdash; K.J.V.].&quot; 1 Cor. 4:4, 
        R.S.V. He well knew that his justification before God was by grace alone, 
        by the blood of Christ alone, and that it was not ever on the basis of 
        what the Holy Spirit had done in him, but on the basis of God's act of 
        liberation on the cross in the Person of Christ (See Rom. 3:24, N.E.B.).</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God's people must 
        be grounded on this gospel of justification before Heaven can entrust 
        them with the latter rain, for under the great outpouring of God's Spirit, 
        signs and wonders will follow the believers as they proclaim the truth 
        in the might of the Spirit's power. Yet with Paul they will still confess, 
        &quot;I am not hereby justified.&quot; It requires God's righteousness, 
        all of His righteousness, to be accepted in His sight. That righteousness 
        is found only in the Man Christ Jesus. We can rest our salvation on nothing 
        less than His humiliation, suffering and death. His was not just the humiliation 
        of a man, but of a God. His excellence of character was infinite, for 
        His earthly life was the embodiment of divine perfection. His sufferings 
        were infinite, His death of infinite value. The sacrifice of Christ amazed 
        the angels. It will be the science, song and wonder of the redeemed for 
        eternity. Upon this one magnificent and unspeakable Gift we must base 
        our right standing with God for time and for eternity. Praise God that 
        there is such a solid ground of hope! What comfort to know that we need 
        never ground our salvation on anything that is within us! And to teach 
        us these things God gives the Holy Spirit.</font></p>
