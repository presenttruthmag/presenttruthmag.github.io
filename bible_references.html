103:12    As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our 
        
transgressions from us.

who <strong>loves</strong> is born of God and knows God.  
        
4:8    He who does not love does not know God, for God is <strong>love</strong>.  
        
4:9    In this the <strong>love</strong> of God was manifested toward us, that God has 
        
sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through 
        
Him.  
        
4:10    In this is <strong>love</strong>, not that we <strong>loved</strong> God, but that He <strong>loved</strong> us 
        
and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.  
        
4:11    Beloved, if God so <strong>loved</strong> us, we also ought to <strong>love</strong> one another.  
        
4:12    No one has seen God at any time. If we <strong>love</strong> one another, God 
        
abides in us, and His <strong>love</strong> has been perfected in us.  
        
4:13    By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He 
        
has given us of His Spirit.  
        
4:14    And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son

</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">40:12    Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, 
    
Measured heaven with a span And calculated the dust of the earth in 
    
a measure? Weighed the mountains in scales And the hills in a balance?  
    
40:13    Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord, Or as His counselor 
    
has taught Him?  
    
40:14    With whom did He take counsel, and who instructed Him, And 
    
taught Him in the path of justice? Who taught Him knowledge, And 
    
showed Him the way of understanding?  
    
40:15    Behold, the nations are as a drop in a bucket, And are 
    
counted as the small dust on the scales; Look, He lifts up the isles 
    
as a very little thing.  
    
40:16    And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, Nor its beasts 
    
sufficient for a burnt offering.  
    
40:17    All nations before Him are as nothing, And they are counted 
    
by Him less than nothing and worthless.  
    
40:18    To whom then will you liken God? Or what likeness will you 
    
compare to Him?  
    
40:19    The workman molds an image, The goldsmith overspreads it 
    
with gold, And the silversmith casts silver chains.  
    
40:20    Whoever is too impoverished for such a contribution Chooses 
    
a tree that will not rot; He seeks for himself a skillful workman To 
    
prepare a carved image that will not totter.  
    
40:21    Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told 
    
you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations 
    
of the earth?  
    
40:22    It is He who sits above the circle of the earth, And its 
    
inhabitants are like grasshoppers, Who stretches out the heavens 
    
like a curtain, And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in.  
    
40:23    He brings the princes to nothing; He makes the judges of 
    
the earth useless.  
    
40:24    Scarcely shall they be planted, Scarcely shall they be sown, 
    
Scarcely shall their stock take root in the earth, When He will also 
    
blow on them, And they will wither, And the whirlwind will take them 
    
away like stubble.  
    
40:25 &quot;To whom then will you liken Me, Or to whom shall I be 
    
equal?&quot; says the Holy One.  
    
40:26    Lift up your eyes on high, And see who has created these 
    
things, Who brings out their host by number; He calls them all by 
    
name, By the greatness of His might And the strength of His power; 
    
Not one is missing.  
    
40:27    Why do you say, O Jacob, And speak, O Israel: &quot;My way 
    
is hidden from the Lord, And my just claim is passed over by my God&quot;?  
    
40:28    Have you not known? Have you not heard? The everlasting God, 
    
the Lord, The Creator of the ends of the earth, Neither faints nor is 
    
weary. His understanding is unsearchable.  
    
40:29    He gives power to the weak, And to those who have no might 
    
He increases strength.  
    
40:30    Even the youths shall faint and be weary, And the young men 
    
shall utterly fall,  
    
40:31    But those who wait on the Lord Shall renew their strength; 
    
They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be 
    
weary, They shall walk and not faint. <br>

1:2    The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was F1 
    
on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the 
    
face of the waters.  
    
1:3    Then God said, &quot;Let there be light&quot; and there was light.  
    
1:4    And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the 
    
light from the darkness.  
    
1:5    God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So 
    
the evening and the morning were the first day.  
    
1:6    Then God said, &quot;Let there be a firmament in the midst of the 
    
waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.&quot;  
    
1:7    Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were 
    
under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; 
    
and it was so.  
    
1:8    And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the 
    
morning were the second day.  
    
1:9    Then God said, &quot;Let the waters under the heavens be gathered 
    
together into one place, and let the dry land appear&quot;; and it was so.  
    
1:10    And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together 
    
of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good.  
    
1:11    Then God said, &quot;Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that 
    
yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, 
    
whose seed is in itself, on the earth&quot;; and it was so.  
    
1:12    And the earth brought forth grass, t<font size="3">he herb that yields seed 
    
according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is

1:13    So the evening and the morning were the third day.  
    
1:14    Then God said, &quot;Let there be lights in the firmament of the 
    
heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs 
    
and seasons, and for days and years;  
    
1:15    and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to 
    
give light on the earth&quot;; and it was so.  
    
1:16    Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the 
    
day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also.  
    
1:17    God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on 
    
the earth,  
    
1:18    and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the 
    
light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.  
    
1:19    So the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  
    
1:20    Then God said, &quot;Let the waters abound with an abundance of 
    
living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face 
    
of the firmament of the heavens.&quot;  
    
1:21    So God created great sea creatures and every living thing 
    
that moves, with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, 
    
and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was 
    
good.  
    
1:22    And God blessed them, saying, &quot;Be fruitful and multiply, and 
    
fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.&quot;  
    
1:23    So the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  
    
1:24    Then God said, &quot;Let the earth bring forth the living creature 
    
according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the 
    
earth, each according to its kind&quot;; and it was so.  
    
1:25    And God made the beast of the earth according to its kind, 
    
cattle according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth 
    
according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.  
    
1:26    Then God said, &quot;Let Us make man in Our image, according 
    
to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over 
    
the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all F2 the earth and 
    
over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.&quot;  
    
1:27    So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He 
    
created him; male and female He created them.  
    
1:28    Then God blessed them, and God said to them, &quot;Be fruitful 
    
and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish 
    
of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that 
    
moves on the earth.&quot;  
    
1:29    And God said, &quot;See, I have given you every herb that 
    
yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose 
    
fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.  
    
1:30    Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, 
    
and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I
    
have given every green herb for food&quot; and it was so. </font>
