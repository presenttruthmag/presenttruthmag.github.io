<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More, sir! Please, more! and soon!&mdash;especially the promised material on the historical view of prophecy as against the currently popular futuristic view.  It seems to us that excessive charismatic subjectivism and futurism are twin evils in the church today, and we are eagerly awaiting your comments on the latter.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am interested in your projected material on the issue of "futurism" (as it is often called). All of these latter-day millennial cults (some within evangelical Christianity, i.e., Scofieldism, and some without, i.e., Armstrongism,  Jehovah's  Witnesses,  Mormonism, etc.) have the following in common: that the great goal of history is a carnal golden age of fleshly peace, plenty and comfort&mdash;along with Jewish supremacy in some cases&mdash;on this present earth, in almost total contradistinction to the uniform teaching of the New Testament.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I trust that this "carnal golden age" idea will be one of the points, if not the focal point, of your upcoming material. Such an era involves a list of Scriptural contradictions and absurdities, e.g.:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1) a second humiliation of our Lord;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) death, pain, suffering and tears after the "last enemy" has been destroyed;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3) a restoration (just like the Romish mass) of Old Testament sacrifices;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(4)	a supposed "golden age" in which a multitude worship the Lord "with their lips, but their heart is far from Him" in surly obedience to His "iron rod rule"!<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font color=maroon>A Call to Question</font></B></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following statement in your masthead is of particular interest to me: "These principles [<i>sola gratia, solo Christo, sola fide and sola Scriptura</i>] call all traditions into question and all statements about the truth into question&mdash;even the ones set forth in this magazine." If you are so sure of your ground and have the courage to criticize yourselves and accept or invite criticisms from others, such attitudes and courage are Christian, objective, scientific and rather rare.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font color=maroon>The Protestant Era at an End!</font></B></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I realize the desired response you wish one to have to the title of your brochure, "The Protestant Era at an End!" is one of shock and dismay. However, I find myself currently reacting to the title with, "At last!" and, "Praise God it's over!" You seem to take a great deal of pride in Protestant history and tradition, and apparently limit truth to this tradition alone. This is a grave mistake for at least two reasons: (1) there are some truly fine prayers and observations by early Roman Catholic theologians; (2) within Protestantism there is much false doctrine as well. Don't misunderstand&mdash;I'm not making a stand for Roman Catholicism. But it seems some of your writers are happier to be "Protestant" than to be Christian! Is Christ divided? Were they baptized in the name of Luther or Calvin? 1 Corinthians 1 does apply to this, I believe. And in making the Protestant fathers the authoritative interpreters of doctrine, you may run into the same heresy the Roman Catholics did in making the church equal to Scripture in its teaching.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a time when men of good will from all religious denominations are making the first efforts in 500 years to patch the cracks of fine doctrinal distinctions and emphasize the unifying effects of Christ's simple message to all ages, "Love God and love your neighbor," your shrill and brassy sound is a good example of man's suspicious and baser nature earlier exemplified.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In these days of "cheap ecumenism," when there is so much loose talk of how all differences between Roman Catholics and Protestants have been resolved, your articles ring a note of truth and honesty which is sorely needed.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've made a notebook of your publications and am enjoying getting an education in the doctrines of the Reformed faith. I have shared some of the points of difference between objective and subjective religion with my senior high Sunday School class, and they were receptive to such a discussion, surprisingly. After having been the Campus Crusade route, it is so refreshing to hit at last upon the truth of justification by faith alone and the all-sufficiency of Christ.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I trust that your emphasis will help many see clearly that wonder and blessing of life in Christ as it is, and as it is based on the objective reality of the gospel, in contrast to the subjectivism that is so strong in many quarters.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In what I have seen of the charismatic movement, the focus is on Christ and His atoning work, who happens to pour out increasing joy in the Spirit&mdash;not, as you put it, on a "frantic effort to find satisfaction in some sort of religious experience."</font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The point of contention and trouble, it seems to me, is not upon salvation which has already been won for Christians but upon the use of the gifts with the proper guidance of the Holy Spirit. These gifts can be grossly misused and abused, just as the Lord's Supper has been misused and abused down through the centuries.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am sorry you feel that you have to start a new publication just to be anticharismatic. I have glanced through <em>Present Truth Magazine</em>, and I see that you have done a lot of twisting of the truth. I think you could find more profitable things to do than to attack others and would strongly suggest you search for the truth rather than try to make everyone believe the way you do.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I read your <em>Present Truth Magazine</em> and consider it a masterpiece in word manipulation and distortion of Scripture.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christ told Nicodemus that he had to be born again!&mdash;that unless you are baptized of the water and the Spirit, you cannot enter the kingdom of God. These are two separate baptisms and do not necessarily occur simultaneously.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I recently received a copy of your special issue  on "<a href="../archive/V/index.htm" target="_blank">Justification by Faith and the Charismatic Movement</a>." I appreciated the basically level-headed and scholarly tone of the magazine.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Scriptural message of justification by faith is never irrelevant. Perhaps your magazine will make some Christians, who have not known before, aware of the issues of the Reformation. Something many Protestants need to hear today is that depending upon feelings for one's salvation is simply another form of salvation by works. I personally grew up in that trap and am eager to help others avoid it.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been an organist and choir director in the Lutheran Church for twenty years.

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I started out as a dispensational fundamentalist, changed to a neo-Pentecostal, and then to a neo-evangelical, and have finally found a "home  in Reformed  theology.  Your magazine has helped greatly in clarifying in my mind just what the distinguishing doctrines of Reformed theology are.

They get millions of "decisions" that way.<br>
