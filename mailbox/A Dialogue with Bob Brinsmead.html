<p class="style1">From Bill Diehl to Bob Brinsmead<br>
April 8, 2013 </p>
<p class="style1">Bob, </p>
<p class="style1">There will always be hooks of doubt upon which to hang ones hat. I think that you have finally come to the real heart of the matter of the Christian faith.&nbsp;We could spend a great deal of time&nbsp;discussing all of your doubtful speculations over the authenticity of the New Testament "witness" : whether or not John and his gospel and epistles are pseudepigrapha or not, whether the gospels of Matthew, Mark, or Luke are true historical record or not, whether the apostle Paul was a raving lunatic or not.&nbsp; You apparently&nbsp;already have total confidence that your opinion regarding their lack of authenticity is unassailable. But actually all of the issues that you have raised and many more for that matter have already been carefully and thoroughly debunked by excellent New Testament scholarship which you obviously have either overlooked or else simply rejected out of hand. </p>
<p class="style1">You have chosen to take the road that leads to a total rejection of the Christ depicted in the New Testament. You take the suppositions and speculations&nbsp;of the Jesus Seminar and other higher critics seriously. (And I do mean "speculations". They&nbsp;make assertions based upon the most meager shreds of evidence and make far reaching extrapolations based upon those questionable assertions which are actually laughable. As computer programmers say, "put junk in and you get junk out.") &nbsp;I have researched their claims and read the rebuttals of these claims by&nbsp;many serious Christian scholars and apologists&nbsp;and find the rebuttals to be much more&nbsp;convincing.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">So there you have it in a nut shell. It's either "sola scriptura" or "sola fraud".&nbsp;Either the witness is a true one or else the witness is a product of a group of fanatical 2d and 3d century lunatics who invented the Savior and His claims as found in the Bible. You have "looked behind every bush" and found fraud. I have looked behind every bush and nook and cranny and found that the weight of evidence is overwhelmingly on the side of&nbsp;acceptance of the testimony of the&nbsp;witnesses recorded in&nbsp;the bible. I do not deny that my acceptance of the record&nbsp;from Genesis to Revelation&nbsp;is for me a very small "leap of faith". But I think that you fail to realize that your acceptance of the arguments of the higher critic scholars&nbsp;is a much&nbsp;longer leap of faith across a&nbsp;Grand Canyon filled with salties. The fact is that even if only one half of the gospel account&nbsp;is true you are in real trouble as to your final outcome once you pass on to the "other side".&nbsp; The terrible warnings and pleading invitations of the&nbsp;Christ of the Bible are something that if true should, I believe, make one take serious pause before brushing them off as a "myth".&nbsp;In doing this, one must reject the complete veracity of the historical record and the&nbsp;theological claims&nbsp;of the Old Testament as well as the New.&nbsp;I am sure that this is the case for you&nbsp;also.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">To the rejecter of its witness the Old Testament is merely Nationalistic Jewish&nbsp; Propaganda. One must with great resolve determine that they were all raving lunatics. There simply is no middle ground, either the God depicted in the record is an actual Being intervening in the horrific stream of human history to save Man from&nbsp;the consequences of his own madness or else He is the figment of the wishful thinking of a few&nbsp;Don Quixote mystics chasing wind mills.&nbsp; (At this point I must scratch my head and ask myself, "Hasn't Bob ever read an account of the recorded history of the human race??) How on earth can one arrive at the conclusion that this horrific record of incalculable suffering, weeping, misery, sickness, war, and gore is merely "God's plan" from the very beginning of the so-called "big bang" : Kill and be killed, Rape and be raped, Steal and be stolen, Burn and pillage and be pillaged. Bob, open your eyes to the reality of life!!!! If the "God" that you have described has actually designed life to be the way it is is an actual Being, then He is a sadist of the first most despicable order.&nbsp; If this is the God and understanding of reality that you "embrace" then you have indeed embraced a monster and a demon. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">Please pardon my directness, but your "advantage" is obviously a pathetic tragedy of the highest order of magnitude. You have thrown away the Pearl of great price for a handful of sand and in the final moment you will wail and gnash your teeth unless you come to your senses like the prodigal son before it is forever too late like the unfaithful&nbsp;Esau who sold his inheritance for a stinking pot of porridge. The story of the deceiving "old prophet" certainly should be a lesson for you to consider and weep over: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style1 style2">1 Kings 13:1-30&nbsp; And behold, a man of God went from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD, and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense. 2 Then he cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD, and said, "O altar, altar! Thus says the LORD: 'Behold, a child, Josiah by name, shall be born to the house of David; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and men's bones shall be burned on you.' " 3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, "This is the sign which the LORD has spoken: Surely the altar shall split apart, and the ashes on it shall be poured out." 4 So it came to pass when King Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, who cried out against the altar in Bethel, that he stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, "Arrest him!" Then his hand, which he stretched out toward him, withered, so that he could not pull it back to himself. 5 The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. 6 Then the king answered and said to the man of God, "Please entreat the favor of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me." So the man of God entreated the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him, and became as before. </p>
  <p class="style1 style2">7 Then the king said to the man of God, "Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward." 8 But the man of God said to the king, "If you were to give me half your house, I would not go in with you; nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place. 9 "For so it was commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way you came.' " 10 So he went another way and did not return by the way he came to Bethel. 11 Now an old prophet dwelt in Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king. 12 And their father said to them, "Which way did he go?" For his sons had seen which way the man of God went who came from Judah. 13 Then he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it, 14 and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. Then he said to him, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" And he said, "I am." 15 Then he said to him, "Come home with me and eat bread." 16 And he said, "I cannot return with you nor go in with you; neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place. 17 "For I have been told by the word of the LORD, 'You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by going the way you came.' " 18 He said to him, "I too am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.' " (He was lying to him.) </p>
  <p class="style1 style2">19 So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water. 20 Now it happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back; 21 and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, "Thus says the LORD: 'Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD, and have not kept the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you, 22 'but you came back, ate bread, and drank water in the place of which the Lord said to you, "Eat no bread and drink no water," your corpse shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.' " 23 So it was, after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, the prophet whom he had brought back. 24 When he was gone, a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his corpse was thrown on the road, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the corpse. </p>
  <p class="style1 style2">25 And there, men passed by and saw the corpse thrown on the road, and the lion standing by the corpse. Then they went and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. 26 Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard it, he said, "It is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of the LORD. Therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to him." 27 And he spoke to his sons, saying, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled it. 28 Then he went and found his corpse thrown on the road, and the donkey and the lion standing by the corpse. The lion had not eaten the corpse nor torn the donkey. 29 And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. So the old prophet came to the city to mourn, and to bury him. 30 Then he laid the corpse in his own tomb; and they mourned over him, saying, "Alas, my brother!" </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style1">Bob, you have been a true prophet of the Lord Jesus Christ, but you have been&nbsp;lied to by false "old prophets" and you have eaten the bread of doubters and agnostics who only want to deceive you so that they&nbsp;can stash your carcass in a grave&nbsp;to share&nbsp;with them&nbsp;and be buried with them in death. It is your Christian friends who mourn over you with&nbsp;the lament of "Alas, my brother!" &nbsp;And to that lament we add, "How the mighty man of God has fallen!" But unlike the Man of God, for you it is not too late. Just as your mother swept you up in her arms when you spitefully continued to throw dirt on her nice cleanly swept floor, you can allow the Lord Jesus Christ who has been hiding behind the door to sweep you up close to Himself once again. This time He will sprinkle clean water upon you and you will mourn for your&nbsp;having caused&nbsp;the nail prints in His hands. The paradise that He offers is no myth, no fools paradise. He is real and faithful and true. He is the way, the truth, and the life. This is no mere theory. This is the true testimony of all the sons of God who call upon the name of the Lord. Seek the Lord while He may be found. Call upon Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and He will have mercy and abundantly pardon. "Behold the Man" standing in the hall of judgment for you!! By His stripes you may be healed. The "universe" that you now find yourself in will at last bite you like the serpent that deceived Eve and said, "You shall not surely die". The&nbsp;wisdom&nbsp;that you think that you have found will be like the bitterness of&nbsp;gall. It's time to quit hiding from the Lord. Come&nbsp;back out to Him&nbsp;and allow Him to clothe you with the clean&nbsp;robe&nbsp;of the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. &nbsp;All things are ready. Come unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. </p>
<p class="style1">Your very good friend, Bill </p>

    <p class="style1">From Bob Brinsmead to Bill Diehl <br>
    April 8, 2013</p>
    <p class="style1">To Bill, </p>
    <p class="style1">I have a whole library of books picking out the weaknesses in Darwinism, especially neo-Darwinism.&nbsp; One of them is by an atheist scientist who finds much of the theory as unconvincing as a fairly tale – he says there are mysteries there that no science as yet can explain. &nbsp;I am more acquainted with the literature pro and con than you realize.&nbsp; I am no longer an Adventist because I took Adventism so seriously that I looked into and examined every nook and cranny of it, ditto with Reformation theology, ditto with Christian theology etc.&nbsp; I looked under and behind every rose bush, so to speak.&nbsp; I did not hastily jump into anything or out of anything. I've dealt with every point I have considered or canvassed thoroughly and honestly – I have found that looking for evidence to prove that one is right is not as important as honestly looking for any evidence that might prove one is wrong.&nbsp; That happens to be the way of true science where healthy scepticism is seen to be more important than a gullibility dressed up as laudable faith.&nbsp; I say again, the same thoroughness with which I went into every aspect of the old Awakening or with which I went into the exploration of the Reformation faith I carried forward in examining the linguistic, contextual and historical meaning of “not under the nomos/gramma/graphe” in Paul and the fourth Gospel.&nbsp; And the same with the age of the earth and evolutionary science. Have the courage, my friend, always to examine your premises, and your taken-for-granted certainties. </p>
    <p class="style1">Take for instance the matter of the historical Jesus.&nbsp; No historian, Christian or otherwise, can tell you when he was born and when he died. The problem is that there is no contemporary record of him.&nbsp; We have nothing written about him during his actual time – we have no written record of his birth, life or death. No doubt there must have been some records, but these were destroyed in the great war with Rome and the sacking and burning of just about everything.&nbsp; The earliest stuff we have written about Jesus is by Paul, and that was about a generation later than Jesus, and a bit later than that we have Mark.&nbsp; We have no eyewitness accounts of Jesus in the Bible. </p>
    <p class="style1">Most of what we nave in the NT was written two and three generations later.&nbsp; Of course the church wanted everyone to believe that the NT contained first hand, eye-witness accounts (or what second Peter, clearly a book forged in Peter's name, claims as eyewitnesses of his majesty)&nbsp; So the church gave names to the NT gospels, all of which are anonymous books written up long after Jesus walked the earth.&nbsp; The church told us that the disciple Matthew wrote the first Gospel, that Mark the disciple of Paul wrote Mark, the physician friend of Paul wrote Luke (even if that was true they were not eye-witnesses) and that John the beloved disciple wrote the Fourth Gospel which the science of linguistics show has been written by at least four different editors just like we have an edited appendix to Mark on the resurrection appearances. </p>
    <p class="style1">Well, who wrote the books?&nbsp; We can simply say they were written up by certain groups of Christian communities and reflected the religion of those disparate communities.&nbsp; Paul and Mark have no knowledge of a virgin birth….that came much later.&nbsp; Mark has no knowledge of a physical resurrection appearances of Jesus – the long ending to Mark is now acknowledged on all sides to be added much later.&nbsp; There are mutually exclusive accounts of the Nativity and the Resurrection appearances in the Gospels. Was the last supper a Passover meal. Yes according to the Synoptics, No according to John.&nbsp; Was the skirmish at the temple at the beginning or end of the ministry of Jesus. Yes according to the Synoptics, No according to John. </p>
    <p class="style1">Did he first appear to his disciples in Galilee, at least 7 days journey from Jerusalem. Yes according to Matthew and Mark, No according to John and Luke.&nbsp; Was his physical flesh and blood body brought out of the grave? No according to the Paul in I Corinthians 15 and no evidence of it in Mark (without the edited long ending), but what happens later? – physical appearance stories complete with fish and chips on the beach.&nbsp; And so I could go on…and on… what is the sense of talking about bodily ascensions to heaven….if that body even travelled at the maximum speed of light, then he has hardly reached our nearest star yet.&nbsp; Since Galileo and Relativity and Time/Space realities, primitive ideas about God up there and hell down there make no sense.&nbsp; There are now laws out there that are not down here, and there is no God up there that is not equally down here…we don't pray or commune with an Elsewhere God.&nbsp; God is not in some other place more than God is in this place.&nbsp; Humans don't fly off somewhere to some other place where God is supposed to be.&nbsp; God is here as much as God is anywhere. </p>
    <p class="style1">There was no fall of man, and God never left.&nbsp; Your good logic will tell you if there was no first Adam there was no second one either.&nbsp; You are exactly right. </p>
    <p class="style1">Death was not introduced to this planet by human sin or Fall. Death was on this planet according to the clear fossil record millions of years before humans walked this planet – in saber teeth tigers, in predatory dinosaurs and in the fish of the sea.&nbsp; Death is written into our DNA – death is both necessary and beneficial.&nbsp; God is the author of both life and death.&nbsp; Both are to be embraced as a gift from God, each in its time, I might add.&nbsp; Jesus did not come to bridge some apocalyptic gulf between God and man - because God never left.&nbsp; I prefer the gospel of Jesus that God is near, you don't need mediators, so you can celebrate the kingdom's arrival right now…. Who needs religion, apocalyptic and its salvationism whether of the Christian or environmental kind? Who needs religion which is based entirely on the apocalyptic fear of death?&nbsp; Who needs all these doctrinal, theological debates or arguments on this for that kind of Salvationism? </p>
    <p class="style1">We are fee to be human, free to love unconditionally as God does…&nbsp; how then do we find God?&nbsp; By finding our neighbour.&nbsp; “He who loves another has seen the face of God.” (Les Miserables)&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, my theism has been transmuted or conflated into humanism, and my humanism into true theism. </p>
    <p class="style1">How can we really communicate when I live in another kind of universe than you do?&nbsp; My real advantage here is that I have lived in your universe as you full well know.&nbsp; I understand it very well.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="style1">Your good friend, </p>

  <strong>To: </strong> Robert Brinsmead from Bill Diehl <br>
Friday, 5 April 2013 3:47 PM    </p>
<p class="style1">Bob, </p>
<p class="style1">Interesting reply. I was replying to your description of your journey as outlined in your last email to me. You stated that your doubts regarding Adventism began once you claim to have discovered that Paul did not teach the Third Use of the Law or living by any written code for that matter. You were able to convince your brother John and Geoff Paxton on that point too. From there you began to doubt the Second Use of the Law as well as doubt the Protestant reformers understanding of the vicarious atonement of Christ and justification by faith. If I understand your words correctly, I assume that&nbsp;you also stated that you finally came to believe that even&nbsp;accepting the cosmology and theology and soteriology of the Bible amounted to Bibliolatry.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you finally made the&nbsp;last break with Christianity&nbsp;when you rejected the apostolic teaching of the divinity of Christ. You state that &nbsp;Ellen White had very little to do with your journey from a conservative Bible believing Christian to arrive at what you believe now.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">I am surprised though to see your rather condescending attitude towards my comments and your ad hominem remarks suggesting that I am very unread and slow to understand the modernist scholarship and thus cannot keep up with you&nbsp;and others who think that they have much more factual truth than poor benighted souls&nbsp;who cannot seem to accept your understanding of what the&nbsp;apostle Paul meant by "living under the law". I guess that you see yourself as the "horseman" who is very much running in advance of the thousands of Christian theologians and Christian scientists who interpret the biblical teachings and scientific cosmological evidence differently that you. Even your brother John pointed out to you that all of the biblical scholars of the Reformation differed from your interpretation, but you seem to have been able to disarm his objections with your views.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">After dismissing with the mere sweep of your hand my&nbsp;suggestion that you are incorrect in your understanding of Paul's true teaching regarding the Ten Commandments and my suggestion that Paul was actually opposing the Ebionite heresy, you then jump to the subject&nbsp;of cosmology and origins. You list a few of the so-called irrefutable evidences that the earth is supposedly billions of years old and&nbsp;that the Biblical account of the origin of life, mankind, evil, suffering, and death is a myth.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">As your friend I can say with all candor that it is very evident that you have never taken the time to actually do any scholarly unbiased investigation into the overwhelming evidence that is contrary to the Darwinist/Big Bang paradigm. You have never attended any actual debates between knowledgeable creationist scholars and Darwinist scholars. The evidence for the truthfulness of the Biblical cosmology is able to completely overwhelm the assumptions proposed by the Darwinists. </p>
<p class="style1">I would hope that you might at least take a look into the discussions offered by your fellow countryman,&nbsp;Ken Ham, who heads the creation scientists at <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/">Answers in Genesis </a>&nbsp;or from the American creation scientists at the <a href="http://www.icr.org/">Institute for Creation Research </a> here in San Diego. You might actually be surprised to see that perhaps it is the Darwinists who can't keep up with the footmen let alone the horses. </p>
<p class="style1">When push comes to shove in any discussions you seem to then take the tack that it does not really matter any way what anyone believes about life, truth, or God.&nbsp; No one can know anything about God or life and so why try to know what the truth is since you think that God does not care about truth or evil or suffering or death or sin or righteousness. </p>
<p class="style1">It just so happens that it is these very things that the God of the Bible is vitally concerned about above all things. Perhaps it is because of this&nbsp;biblical concern&nbsp;that so many of the scholars with whose views&nbsp;you want to identify want to dismiss the theology of the bible with a mere condescending pat on the head and a condescending&nbsp;wink of the eye. But the fact is that is exactly how Jesus Christ himself was regarding by the "scholars" of his day: a lunatic who thinks he is the only one with any&nbsp;understanding of what life is all about. </p>
<p class="style1">Just how do you arrive at your sweeping conclusion that " all your thinking and believing and theologising (and mine too) does not change what God thinks of us" ? Without any word from God himself, how can you make such a pronouncement? Have you talked with God directly and he told you this? How do you even know that there is a God? What criteria do you use to reach such a conclusion? What data do you bring to the table? I bring the witness of historical figures such as Adam, Noah, Moses, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the major prophets, the minor prophets, John the Baptist, Jesus Christ, and his apostles who all left us their testimony as to what they have seen with their own eyes and touched with their own hands. Are all these men liars and deceivers and myth-tellers?&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">The proof is in the fruit that the tree bares. What is the fruit of Darwinism, Deism, Atheism, Agnosticism, Communism, Socialism, and Romanism? Compare the fruit of these philosophies throughout history with the fruit born by the evangelical Christian faith: the modern hospital systems, the scientific method of applied science, democratic governments of the people by the people and for the people, &nbsp;and all of the modern colleges and universities which had their origins within evangelical Christian movements, and even the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the USA. These were all the fruit of the evangelical Christian faith as revealed in the Bible, the word of God. </p>
<p class="style1">Do you know how radio carbon dating actually claims to arrive at its conclusions and that there are serious challenges being brought to bear upon these conclusions? Do you know how geologists actually arrive at their dating methods for the rock strata and that there are many distinguished scientists who are challenging the accepted assumptions and extrapolations of the popular views on the ages of the rocks? Do you know how genetic mutations are actually expressed in living organisms and that there are a variety of views challenging their so-called beneficial effect upon life forms?&nbsp; Do you actually know&nbsp;that the speed of light can be altered by gravity and thus is unreliable as a time measurement? &nbsp;Do you know about the red shift and the blue shift and how there are differing views&nbsp;on how to interpret these phenomena? </p>
<p class="style1">I would urge you to take some time to look into both sides of the debate that is becoming so intense that many of the Darwinists are now abandoning their evolutionary cosmology in favor of a "panspermia" cosmology. Why are they doing this? Because they sense that they have actually lost the argument for biological and genetic evolution for the origin of life and its many iterations. Maybe, just maybe it is you who have fallen behind the footman&nbsp;and who is using arguments that those who are in the forefront of the&nbsp;Darwinist circles&nbsp;don't really use any more. </p>
<p class="style1">Hope that you are able to have your assumptions challenged without becoming too impatient and caustic as you have in the past when involved in discussion. But then if we cannot know anything about anything that really matters, what is the profit in even discussing anything at all? If we cannot know anything until we "pass on to the other side", does life and truth&nbsp;have any meaning at all? </p>
<p class="style1">Cheers to you too, (I never really knew what "cheers" meant. Sort of a meaningless salutation like, "here's mud in your eye!". Doesn't really mean anything I guess :-) </p>
<p class="style1">Hope you are in good health and finding love in your life from your family and friends, (I hope that I am still counted as among your friends after all this!) I wish your mother and father were still alive so that they could have more of an influence upon you than I can. Bernard called me on the phone many years ago in the 1990's I think. We were never able to meet though. Also Cedrick Taylor was in touch back then with me for a while, but I have lost touch with him. Jack Zwemer called me a month ago and asked me if I could help you gather some of your stuff. He sounds great. Hope he is in good health. Norman has been in touch but not too recently. He had prostrate cancer then and I hope that he is doing well. </p>
<p class="style1">I keep rolling along here in San Diego. Just finished building a big home in the mountains on six acres of land. Sort of like a mountain lodge with lots of rustic beams and paneling. It is spring time now and the cold winter snow is gone. Lots of deer, turkeys, mountain lions, bob cats and birds. Planted lots of good fruit trees and have irrigation to all of them from the well. </p>
<p class="style1">Take good care of yourself, </p>

    <p class="style1">Bill, </p>
    <p class="style1">I like your tenacity and zeal. But your theology and worldview means that you only have a very restricted future on the fringes of Adventism. The rest of the world will pass you by because what you talk about has no relevance to the mass of modern humanity and will therefore never have an impact on that mass of humanity – which may be OK if you think that God is satisfied with a little esorteric group living on the fringes of a little apocalyptic sect who image that they and they alone have the power or mission to somehow bring on the eschaton if only they can get the message right.&nbsp; For goodness sake, if you cannot &nbsp;fathom what “living under the nomos/gramma/graphe means”…. If you can't keep up the &nbsp;footmen, how will you contend with the horsemen.&nbsp;&nbsp; As for contending for a 6,000 year old earth and a Fall of man myth (we can easily prove that the Aborigenes have been here in Australia for 50,000 yrs … don't you even keep up with the science of mapping the human genome and DNA sequences that prove Homo sapiens came out of Africa well over 100,000 years ago, and what about the discovery of all those Neandathal remains for which they now have their DNA…&nbsp; you ought to read a good book on the history and evidence for the birth of our universe about 13.7 billion years ago, where the scientists first discovered or heard the background noise &nbsp;of the Big Bang. &nbsp;There is not much future remaining with a troglodyte theology.&nbsp; When I became a man, I put away childish things.&nbsp; But none of these comments mean that I think any less of you or that God thinks any less of you nor any more of me…we are safe in the divine keeping, and all your thinking and believing and theologising (and mine too) does not change what God thinks of us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheers,&nbsp; RDB </p>

Tuesday, 2 April 2013 2:06 PM </p>
<p class="style1">Bob, </p>
<p class="style1">Give me some time to do that. </p>
<p class="style1">In the meanwhile I think that you need to rethink your understanding of the historical context of Paul's dispute with the Judaising sect of the Christian circumcising party who came to be known as Ebionites (the humble ones). The issue was not&nbsp;that the&nbsp;Galatians were&nbsp; starting with justification and then being made perfect or complete by obedience to the Law. This was your premise regarding the nature of the Galatian error as you stated in Present Truth. The actual error of the Judaising party was that they completely rejected the concept of a substitutionary atonement on the cross by the Lord Jesus Christ and they also rejected the eternal divinity and pre-existence of Christ. </p>
<p class="style1">When Paul accuses the Galatians of now "being made perfect by the works of the Law" he is saying that they had completely rejected the concept of justification by faith in the substitutionary atonement of Christ&nbsp;and had fallen into the Ebionite error of salvation and eternal life by keeping the Law. The&nbsp;imputed active and passive righteousness of Christ had no place in the Ebionite circumcision party teaching. They taught that Christ was merely a Messiah who showed the way to eternal life by keeping the Law. The believer was to copy the pattern laid down by Christ and thus obtain salvation. </p>
<p class="style1">In other words, Christ was circumcised: the believer should be circumcised. Christ kept the shadows of the holy days and ceremonial sabbaths: The believer should and can keep all of the sabbaths. Christ lived a perfect life of obedience to the Ten Commandments: The believer must do the same. Thus for these Ebionites salvation was by imitation not by substitution and imputation. This is why Paul accused the Galatians of rejecting his gospel of atonement&nbsp;for "another" gospel of imitation. That is why Paul begins his epistles to the Galatian and the Colossians with a clear proclamation of&nbsp;salvation through faith in the blood of&nbsp;the divine Christ (substitution). </p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style3">Colossians 1:14-16 In whom we have redemption through his blood , even the forgiveness of sins:&nbsp; Who is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created , that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him : </p>
  <p class="style3">Colossians 1:19-22&nbsp; For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; And, having made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.&nbsp; And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled&nbsp; In the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight : </p>
  <p class="style3">Galatians 1:3-7 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, 4 Who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: 5 To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. </p>
  <p class="style3">Galatians 2:21-3:1 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.&nbsp;O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you? </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style1">The point that I am making here is that you got off the track when you misunderstood the actual error that Paul was confronting. It was not a matter of the Third Use of the Law. It was a matter of rejecting the concept of the atonement of Christ on the cross as the means of reconciliation of the sinner to God through faith in the blood of Christ. This is what the Judaisers were rejecting. They taught acceptance with God through the believer's obedience to Law ( nomos )&nbsp;just as Jesus was accepted by His obedience to the Law. This was a gospel of attainment rather than atonement. </p>
<p class="style1">Your "Sabbatarianism Re-examined" was a total misrepresentation of the historical context of the epistles of Paul. Your "three witnesses" from Romans, Colossians, and Galatians were taken out of their historical context and misused to attempt to prove that Paul had rejected the Third Use of the Law. Paul was attacking any kind of law ( nomos )&nbsp;keeping as a means to justification and eternal life. </p>
<p class="style1">Once starting down this road I think that you probably began to peruse the works of other higher criticism scholars who lead you right out of the Christian faith entirely. </p>
<p class="style1">By the way, <em>cierographon</em> in the Greek in Colossians 2:14&nbsp;does not mean Law or rules of conduct. It means the list of charges (indictment)&nbsp;that&nbsp;is against the sinner.&nbsp; The Law is not blotted out and nailed to the cross. The <em>debt</em> that we owe to the Law was nailed to the cross. This is why Paul states that we are not debtors to the Law but to grace. Those who are "under the Law" as the Judaisers were teaching are still in debt to the Law to keep it perfectly if they are to attain to the righteousness of God and eternal life. This was the way of the flesh. The gospel was the way of the Spirit. </p>

      Monday, April 01, 2013 5:45 PM </p>
    <p class="style1">Bill, </p>
    <p class="style1">When I do a thorough outline of my journey, you will understand that what you say as to what made me change is only conjecture, and a false one at that. </p>
    <p class="style1">Actually, you would have to look at my restudy of the OT and Jesus meaning of Justice/Righteousness in a three part series, The Scandal of God's Justice.&nbsp; Then a review of Reformation theology with special attention to its doctrine of the third use of the law and an understanding of what Paul meant by not living under the nomos/gramma/graphe – terms that both he and the NT culture used interchangeably.&nbsp; I understood Paul to mean that not living under the law was the same as not living under any written rule of life and not living under any document including the Bible.&nbsp; This insight that came to me had nothing to do with the EGW – she was furtherest from my mind – but I was going back to NT linguistics and arguments from Paul in his use of the words nomos, gramma and graphe.&nbsp; This led me to say that the Reformation doctrine of the third use of the law (and the second use of the law too for that matter) was simply Galatianism.&nbsp; The Jerusalem brethren had come up to Galatia telling converts to Christ that now that they were believers, they ought to start living by the OT -&nbsp;&nbsp; if you look at Paul you will find that nomos means scripture and scripture means nomos – or that nomos can means the Psalms and/or the prophets.&nbsp; If you have not seen that, then you have not read Paul's letters or the book of John closely.&nbsp; When I was at college, I memorized all of Paul's epistles and the book of John, so it is easy for me to scroll through the different texts in my mind.&nbsp; If you want linguistic help on this, then I suggest you read Kittel's NT Dictionary on the meaning of nomos in the NT -&nbsp; it means scripture including its history and stories (as in Galatians 4)&nbsp; Paul can cite an OT prophet and call it nomos, and Jesus in John can cite a Psalm and call it nomos.&nbsp; And so Paul, now that Christ has come we are no longer under nomos/gramma –written codes and rules of life- or graphe which all more or less mean the same thing. </p>
    <p class="style1">Well yes, I understood then that EGW understood none of this, she simply parotted off the Protestestant/Puritan tradition about the second and third uses of the law, like the saying, “The law drives us to Christ and Christ sends us back to the law.”&nbsp; What a joke to be so ignorant of the actual NT and Paul especially!&nbsp;&nbsp; So yes, when I rejected Biblicism (but not the wisdom of the Bible or value of the Bible) I had to reject living by EGW or anything else.&nbsp; But I never did subscribe to Walter Rae's bitter attack on EGW – he concentrated on her literary borrowings and implied she was a total fraud – but I concentrated on the fact that she was wrong because she was into Galatianism, and she was wrong as per the book of Hebrews, 1844 etc. Hence my kind appraisal of EGW in my Judged by the Gospel , including mention of her valid prophetic ministry to SDA's – she saved the church from a much worse kind of legalism.&nbsp; Please take into consideration my very late The Theology of EGW, written for the express purpose of trying to teach SDA's a better appreciation of “the common faith”. </p>
    <p class="style1">Whenever I moved on in any single point, it was only after long and careful reflection on the evidence from every conceivable angle.&nbsp; It did not rush from one point to the next.&nbsp; When I explored Reformation theology, I explored it with great care and thoroughness.&nbsp; When I finally reviewed 1844, I reviewed it with care and great&nbsp; thoroughness – it generally took me 10 years to graduate from one major landmark position to the next – I never woke up one morning and just decided I would start beating another drum.&nbsp; Let me tell you a little story:&nbsp; when my brother John saw that I was rejecting the whole protestant tradition of the third use of the law, he paced around my large library of at least 10,000 books, he pulled out Luther, he pulled out Calvin, he pulled out the Puritans, he pulled out John Wesel, he pulled out the Systematic Theologians (Hodge, Strong etc) and said something like, “You are not just flying in the face of EGW and the Adventists, you are flying against Luther, Calvin, Bunyan, Wesley, Spurgeon and all of them….. you are sitting out there like an old shag on a rock…you are flying in the face of hundreds of years of the best Christian tradition….have you&nbsp; lost your mind?”&nbsp; But when he finally cooled down and settled down to review the best in NT studies (Sanders, Bring and others) and some good NT period history, he too was convinced.&nbsp; When I flew to US with Paxton, he asked me what was my evidence, and we just went straight to the letters of St. Paul - and Paxton understood it also. </p>
    <p class="style1">You see first of all I questioned my Adventist assumptions enough to go back to the Reformation – (after ten years) </p>
    <p class="style1">Then I went back to NT documents in historical and linguistic context and question the premises of the Reformation ( that is after another 10 years) </p>
    <p class="style1">Then I started to question that assumptions of the NT documents written two and three generations after the historical Jesus (then silence for a whole ten years, because I did not known nor was I prepared to cross my Rubecon on &nbsp;the Christian presuppositions about the absolute divinity of Jesus.&nbsp; That &nbsp;was the holy of holies of the Christian faith.&nbsp; I was not blind to the implications.&nbsp; So help me God, I crossed over after ten whole years of silence, and wrote The Scandal of Joshua ben Adam.&nbsp; How much did EGW question enter into my thinking in any of this long journey?&nbsp; Very little.&nbsp; I am indebted to EGW for a lot of good things.&nbsp; I am indebted to Paul for giving me the key to escape from Biblicism (Bibliolatry).&nbsp; I love the theological implications of his 1 Corinthians 13.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="style1">Hey, what about you read Tabor's recently published Paul and Jesus – or The Jesus Discovery? </p>
    <p class="style1">What about reading my An Outline of the Apocalyptic Theology from Zoroaster to Al Gore?&nbsp; (Irenic Publications)&nbsp; You could get it up on Google in less than a minute. </p>
    <p class="style1">But don't try to evaluate something that you have never evaluated. </p>
    <p class="style1">Have fun, </p>

    <br>
    Bob, 
</p>
<p class="style1">For what its worth, my own opinion as to why you abandoned the historic Christian faith is that when the White Lie came out and the revelations of Ellen White's extensive literary borrowing came out into the open your confidence in her ministry was completely shattered and destroyed. You reacted in an excessively negative way toward all that she and the Seventh-day Adventist movement stood for and irrationally abandoned all faith in any form of divine inspiration and revelation.&nbsp;(thus your&nbsp;attempted illustration&nbsp;of divine knowledge&nbsp;as&nbsp;being a&nbsp;"large piece of chalk&nbsp;writing on a postage stamp).&nbsp;Your excessive reaction totally destroyed your confidence in the faithfulness and truthfulness of the witness, historicity, and&nbsp;testimony of the apostles Peter, James, John and Paul regarding the identity, mission, and purpose of the life and death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. You have relegated their witness to the realm of hopeful fantasy with a very large dose of willful deception and exaggeration. The Jesus Seminar is an example of this thinking. </p>
<p class="style1">From that point it was all down hill towards a deistic humanism with a leaning towards mysticism and social Darwinism. Your dabbling in near death experience seems to be a hope that all life consciousness is merely a part of the whole divine mind into which all life eventually merges. You may or may not like it when others try to&nbsp;categorize your personal philosophical journey, but it may be hard for you to stand back and realize that there are many others throughout history who have made the same journey and ended up where you are today in your world view. Once one abandons faith in any divine revelation regarding the meaning of life and history&nbsp;there are very few other choices for one to embrace. Your present hopeful outlook can only be attributable to a subjective mysticism. The only other alternative to subjective mysticism&nbsp;is to sink into total despair of&nbsp;there being&nbsp;any "meaning" at all&nbsp;for the existence of life and the universe. </p>
<p class="style1">There is no question that you have exhibited a savant ability to delve head first into the realm of epistemology and philosophy.&nbsp; There is hardly a shade of belief that you have not examined in passionate thoroughness. I remember your talk on the meaning of life. <a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/realaudio/meaning_life1.ram">What is the Meaning of Life? (part 1) </a><a href="http://www.presenttruthmag.com/realaudio/meaning_life2.ram">What is the Meaning of Life? (part 2) </a>&nbsp;In fact without any Word from outside of us there is no real meaning to anything in life: there is no truth, no evil, no goodness, no right or wrong. Pain, sadness, loneliness,&nbsp;and tragedy are not even ripples in the fabric of existence without the Word, the Logos of God. </p>
<p class="style1">Once as a theology major at Andrews University I was walking on the campus and Erwin Gane passed by me. You may remember him as one of your detractors. &nbsp;I stopped him and asked him what he thought of Bob Brinsmead and the present agitation on the gospel. He abruptly answered in a very caustic tone that I was in&nbsp;great danger in reading the material of a "narcissist" like Bob Brinsmead. &nbsp;I replied that maybe it takes a "narcissist" for God to use as His instrument to arouse the Adventist people. He just huffed and walked on. I guess that we are all narcissists in one way or another. It's part of being human. </p>

    <p class="style1">Thanks Bill… I am working with a friend from way back who has some computer expertise to do an anthology of everything that we can find from decade to decade – I will do a few historical notes on the historical background to certain things but leave each publication in its original form – it should be a complete record of the journey that anybody can refer to for whatever reason.&nbsp; So your help is appreciated in getting started.&nbsp; There are also some people who kept just about everything along the way…&nbsp; Dr. Arthur Patrick was leading Avondale figure…went to college with me….he kept touch over the years…wanted to bring about a reconciliation in the church… agreed with him they should let Des Ford back in, but no point in trying to achieve same with me as I have journeyed on a long way from that world.&nbsp; Anyway he died recently, but recently wrote an article Robert Daniel Brinsmead: A Reflection after 57 Years.&nbsp; Arthur did not have a mean bone in his body, and I think he wrote an interesting and charitable paper.&nbsp; In contrast to the stuff in Wikapedia which is terrible. </p>
