<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I commend <em>Present Truth Magazine</em> as a courageous statement of the pivotal religious issue of our time. If we at all value the name &quot;Christian&quot; or wish to call ourselves by it, we had better make up our collective mind to return to the concepts of the adequacy and authority of the Scriptures by themselves for &quot;all things that pertain unto life and godliness.&quot;<br>
    
    <br>
    
I must add a word of thanks to you for disabusing me of some incorrect secondhand opinions I have had of Martin Luther and John Calvin. I know they were fallible men like myself, but I was not aware of the fullness of their viewpoint and its closeness to the actual claims of Scripture. They were much more Biblical than I have given them credit for being.<br>

The ministry of <em>Present Truth Magazine</em> is sorely needed to counteract the fallacy of the modern &quot;tongues&quot; movement. &quot;<a href="../archive/XI/11-1p2.htm" target="_blank">The Current Religious Scene and the Gospel</a>,&quot; touched the sore nerve of the entire charismatic movement: the inclusion of those who deny the Bible's cardinal truths. I refer to the Episcopalian priest who denies the virgin birth and the resurrection of Christ, yet who has received the &quot;baptism.&quot; This is typical. Many Catholic Pentecostals continue to smoke, drink and endorse papal authority and Mariolatry. Anyone who thinks this represents the &quot;fullness&quot; of the Holy Spirit must be blind! Your message is desperately needed in a day of gross religious confusion.<br>

Your statement concerning an Episcopalian priest who speaks in tongues and at the same time denies the virgin birth and resurrection does not prove anything. A good theologian would know that Satan can counterfeit the genuine. Because a person speaks in tongues does not mean he is a Christian. You are taking isolated human experiences and throwing them in the same bag with all charismatics.<br>

<br>
I don't care what Fr. Edward O'Connor or J. Rodman Williams say. Are you saying that you have all the truth? While you are spending your time &quot;putting Christianity on solid ground,&quot; the charismatics are preaching the kingdom and saving souls from hell!<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
After reading your issue and comparing it to other past publications, it is obvious that either your articles on the &quot;charismatic,&quot; &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; movement are greatly misinformed or you really don't understand it at all. It is too bad that such a magazine is read by ministers and laymen alike, who may have valid questions but, after viewing such articles, may thoroughly be in confusion&mdash;which, incidentally, is not our Lord's will for us.<br>

<br>
I refer specifically to the article, &quot;<a href="../archive/XI/11-1p1.htm" target="_blank">The Burning Passion of the Current Religious Scene</a>.&quot; Why is it necessary to give information about an extremist, referring to the Episcopalian priest who was so liberated that he neither believes in the virgin birth nor in the resurrection? Yet it was claimed he has received the &quot;baptism&quot; in the Spirit. Apparently, throughout this entire article your primary aim is to find radicals to probe into and label as &quot;charismatics&quot; just because they assume the name &quot;Pentecostal.&quot;<br>

<br>
Don't you realize that the spirit spoken of is not necessarily the Holy Spirit of God? Satan himself manifests himself as many spirits and essentially tries to persuade us that he is the &quot;Holy Spirit.&quot; This obviously will lead many questionable believers in the wrong direction and to eventual damnation.<br>

<br>

In Acts 4:8, 31 Paul clearly states that the pouring out of God's Holy Spirit is to glorify Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah and Saviour of the world. Also, this act enables us to speak with boldness of our Lord Jesus Christ, thus bearing witness to others. How can one assume that a spiritually full person would then deny Christ? How ridiculous!<br>

<br>

There are indeed many tests of the Spirit, and certainly if it is not Scriptural, then it cannot be of God. In simple words, denying Christ is definitely not intended or Scriptural but must be the devil working overtime.<br>

I found your articles on &quot;<a href="../archive/XI/11-1p2.htm" target="_blank">The Current Religious Scene and the Gospel</a>&quot;  informative. Your desire to cast the light of God's Word on unScriptural religious experience is appreciated. It must however be recognized that there is a Scriptural experience. Christ called it the new birth. It is a radical change: sins are forgiven and their burden lifted; a heart once in rebellion loves God and man; a spirit once dead comes to life and receives the witness of God's Spirit; a life of vanity becomes a life of fruitfulness; in short, all things become new. It is an experience &quot;solely by grace, solely by Christ and solely by faith.&quot; To Christ goes all the glory.<br>

<br>

The gospel must hold first place over experience that is, the redemptive acts of God in history must never be neglected or distorted by total subjectivism. Yet the end result, the purpose of these historic acts&mdash;the incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, etc.&mdash;was one: to bring salvation to fallen man. The historic acts and the experience, made possible by the acts, go hand in hand. To deny the acts is to call God a liar, but to affirm the acts and deny the experience is to reject the salvation they offer. The balance and interdependence of objective fact and subjective experience must be maintained.<br>

Just finished the section, &quot;<a href="../archive/XI/11-1p2.htm" target="_blank">The Current Religious Scene and the Bible</a>.&quot;. Excellent! Like a fresh, cool breeze in the desert of humanism.<br>

<br>

I heartily agree. There is no revelation or experience apart from the revealed Word of God, the Holy Bible. May all fall under its enlightening pages, as we will all stand before it in judgment.<br>

<br>
I am reminded of Isaiah 8:20 in reference to those who place their experience above the Word of God:&quot;. . . if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them.&quot;<br>

<br>

May God continue to encourage you to minister to those who love the Book above pseudo-religious experiences.<br>

I am delighted with your  issue on the current religious scene. I certainly appreciate your publication and have found nothing like it in all of Japan&mdash;neither in the Japanese language nor in English. It would certainly benefit many Japanese pastors, evangelists, Christian workers, laymen, etc., if they had something like this in their language. It has helped me over many rough spots.<br>

<br>

I understand, from a national pastor here in Japan, that speaking in ecstatic speech is not limited to the Pentecostal movement but can be found in Buddhism as well.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For a long time I have admired and appreciated the material in <em>Present Truth Magazine.</em> However, I had one reason for disappointment with it. The material was great, but I felt that because of the type of arguments presented, it was not suitable to give to non-Christians. I had hoped that you would sometime publish something with this doctrinal basis which would be suitable for non-Christians. I believe you have done it with your booklet, <em>Four Great Certainties.</em><br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font color="maroon">&quot;Sola Scriptura</font></B></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I agree with you that ecumenism and neo-Pentecostalism are dangers to the church. However, I would like to point out that another very dangerous threat to the church lies in the un-Scriptural higher critical method, which many liberal and misguided pastors are using today. The laymen of the church should be aware ot this danger and be able to recognize it when they hear higher critical sermons from the pulpit. The method has as its basic premise that the Bible is not totally inerrant, that since men wrote the Bible there must necessarily be errors in it, that the Bible is only a container for the Word of God and not the very Word of God itself, and that through human reason a man can finally dig out what is God's Word from all the fallible human words in the Bible. This method not only denies the inerrancy of Scripture but purports to be able to interpret through human reason, which is a denial of the principle that only Scripture interprets Scripture. If one is to follow the Reformation dictum of <em>sola Scriptura</em>, then this subjective method of interpretation is false.<br>

Your position on justification by faith seems correct, fundamental and scriptural. For that reason I like your magazine. We must base our position on the whole Bible, not on the word of men&mdash;even giants like Calvin and Luther (whom I have a great deal of respect for).<br>

When I first came to know the Lord, it was in one of the &quot;Jesus freaks&quot; movements. But I thank the Lord that He has now revealed His truth to me and that I am now truly headed in the right direction. Yet so many others&mdash;old friends&mdash;seem to be still caught up in the movement and are so involved with the experiences with the &quot;Spirit&quot; that they seem to neglect the Word of God and the importance of the Bible. I'm sure that if they read their Bibles more, they could see that what they are doing is plainly against the Word of God.<br>

    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have read most of the special issue entitled &quot;<a href="../archive/V/index.htm" target="_blank">Justification by Faith and the Charismatic Movement</a>.&quot; You are making a helpful contribution to what will be, I suspect, the most intense and, hopefully, the most fruitful theological debate within the Christian church in a long time. We may indeed be on the verge of a new Reformation. In so far as it is of God, I am sure you would agree that we can welcome it.<br>
    
    <br>
      As I observe the charismatic movement locally and stay in touch with it personally, I share your concern about a total submersion in subjectivity. On the other hand, the growth, not only of the charismatic movement, but of the human potential movement in secular circles, and its appeal to Christians and to church programing in such forms as &quot;relational theology&quot; as propagated by Faith at Work and WORD publishers, is an unmistakable sign that the dimension of the emotional life has been woefully neglected in the teaching and Christian experience of our &quot;mainline&quot; Protestant churches. We seem unable to reach a balance between the objective reality of the gospel, which alone gives us a place to stand in assurance of God's saving grace, and the filling of the Spirit, which enables us, without debauchery, to express freely and joyfully the feelings that, as creatures of the flesh, are also God's gift. To literally thousands, perhaps millions, of serious, struggling, earnest Christians, this question of how to experience within the liberty and joy which Christ came to bring is &quot;where it's at.&quot;<br>
    
    <br>
      Unless the gospel we preach is God's vehicle of grace for truly setting people free for joyous, obedient living, there is something wrong in the way we are communicating it. Simply to say that we must hold on to the objectivity of the gospel, while necessary, is not sufficient, The same apostle who so powerfully upholds the value of law while insisting on the all-sufficiency of grace, calls us to walk &quot;in the Spirit&quot; and manifest the fruits of love, joy, peace, etc. While these qualities are deeper than our feelings in their fullest implications, they are exceedingly difficult for most Christians to appropriate with any sense of reality if their emotional life never gets healed.<br>
    
    <br>
      I hope and pray that your concern for the preservation of Reformation truth may be broad enough to explore its weaknesses as well as its strengths and so encourage those who see both to stay with the struggle to preach and experience a genuinely &quot;full gospel.&quot;<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font color="maroon">Faith and Works</font></B></BR>
  
    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I find <em>Present Truth Magazine</em> articles well written and worth the time and effort to read. As an Anglo-Catholic Episcopalian priest, there is, of course, more than a little with which I do not agree. I do, however, feel very much in sympathy with the references to &quot;subjectivism&quot; so rampant throughout many areas of Christendom today. Often it does seem as if the folks involved in the charismatic movement are in truth trying their best to force God's hand: &quot;Show us a sign!&quot; I tend to agree with one of my teachers (perhaps one of the greatest), the late Prof. Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, that the predominance of natural religion in America, and common in practically every denomination, does account for the popularity and strength of subjectivism so evident throughout the present religious scene in America.<br>
    
    <br>
      Where I part company with you is, as you can well imagine, in your presentation of justification by faith in its pristine purity. For it seems so evident that, from a historical perspective, and certainly as observable throughout Protestantism in America, one just cannot find illustrations of what you promise: &quot;Then will the conscience be cleansed, the heart will find peace with God, and a life of good works will flow from the certain conviction of being accepted of God.&quot; As O. H. Mower, a psychologist at the University of Illinois, has observed, how many are those who have tried to believe in and follow the orthodoxy which you postulate to their spiritual desperation! In particular he cites clergy who go on and on preaching &quot;justification by faith&quot; and yet whose consciences stand accused because of undisciplined lives and personal moral crises which let them know in obvious terms that unless they let the apostle James have his say too, they are destined for spiritual suicide. I must say in all honesty that I have yet to meet a minister or layman who manages to translate what you write about &mdash;&quot;justification by faith&quot;&mdash;into his own day-to-day experience.<br>
    
    <br>
      Never for a moment do I consider that the &quot;works&quot; which I do earn me a farthing in the eyes of God. Yet I do believe that God expects acts of obedience and response to His commands. I also believe that faith leads to a &quot;conscience cleansed&quot; (but see nothing wrong with and much to commend in what seems to me a fruit of faith: the motivation to confess my sins without feeling it stained with the brand of &quot;works&quot;). And that faith leads on then to &quot;a life of good works.&quot; But I also believe that when the fire of faith burns low, better to settle for &quot;works&quot; than to simply throw up one's hands in despair (as has happened with so many to leave the church, usually with a guilty conscience).<br>
    
    <br>
    
I admire your kind of clear and forceful writing, which is obviously supported with some honest scholarship and yet coupled with genuinely sincere faith.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font color="maroon">Why?</font></B></BR>
  
    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you for the help you have given (and still are giving) to me in sorting out what the Bible has to say about my assurance of salvation. Coming out of a conservative Lutheran environment, then being involved for a time with the Jesus People, and now studying for the Lutheran ministry, you have provided me with very valuable counterbalance to the emotionalism prevalent today in much theology.<br>
    
    <br>
      In the last two years I have seen some of my former Christian associates fall away from Christ, others get further into &quot;tongues,&quot; and some become deeper Christians. Why is it, though, that so many people seem to equate &quot;faithfulness to the Bible&quot; (a very necessary thing) with &quot;Everyone must be a Christian just like me&quot;? I find this tendency far too many times in myself demanding that everyone allow me to live out my own style of life but claiming that if they are to be Christians, then they must do it my way. I wish that more people could remember that we are to take a firm and unified stand on the basis of Scripture and that we are free in other areas to disagree.<br>
    
    <br>
    
Among the Jesus People I found a tolerance of disagreements on adiaphora but a unity of theology (although admittedly embryonic). Now I find that I am among people with whom I share a deeper and more accurate understanding of Christ's work and yet less tolerance for deviation in unimportant matters.<br>
    
<br>
  Lest you think that I am postulating a &quot;return to basic theology and forget the rest,&quot; I am not. But I think that we many times do fall under the indictment made against us by Pentecostals&mdash;that we show very little love. If we truly (and I believe that we do) teach Christ correctly, shouldn't our lives show it in such measure that any counterfeits (be they liberal &quot;social concern,&quot; Pentecostal enthusiasm, etc.) will be shown up as nothing more than a carbon copy?<br>
    
<br>
  I really want to know why it is that the world doesn't still say of us as it did of the early New Testament church, &quot;See how they love one another.&quot;<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you so much for your publication. I agree entirely with your views. I have been an evangelical Christian for nearly forty years and, like you, can find nothing in Holy Writ to support the &quot;second blessing&quot; of the tongues movement. Indeed, I have been puzzled and worried over the drift towards Romanism in the Pentecostal movement and the World Council of Churches despite the great issues of the Reformation. The tendency today is to forget the past and cover over doctrinal differences, forgetting the great doctrines of the Reformation.<br>

I have had the same concern as you express regarding Pentecostalism for many years, and your ministry is an echo of my concern. Constantly one finds that &quot;evangelicalism&quot; is a meaningless term and is seldom synonymous with the Reformed faith.<br>

<br>

I have given close attention to Pentecostalism for many years and, in recent times, to its ecumenical impact, specially in relation to Rome. I think there are signs of a genuine reformation amongst some Roman Catholics&mdash;and they will pay the price for their faithfulness. But the system is still giving all the evidence it ever did as to who masterminds it.<br>

    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here in South Africa we face the same problems as you face&mdash;i.e., an aggressive Pentecostalism, a remarkable growth in Catholicism, and widespread doctrinal ignorance of our Protestant heritage among English-speaking South Africans. I have been concerned about this for some time but have not known what to do in the circumstances. Unfortunately, Pentecostalism makes such a great appeal to our people, although among Baptists the movement is not great. But as far as I can see, the writing is on the wall, and the Baptists will not be able to withstand the great pressures that are going to come upon them&mdash;unless something is done to stem the tide. On the other hand, there is a growing Reformed movement apparent among many Baptists, and I feel that there is going to come a time when the issues will become so clear-cut that division will result.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I find the letters in <em>Present Truth Magazine</em> interesting&mdash;particularly those from the so-called charismatics. Having been involved in Pentecostalism in my early Christian life, I can understand their position although I do not share their discomfort. I have no argument with <i>sola gratia, solo Christo</i> and <i>sola fide</i> as well as <i>sola Scriptura</i> because my salvation is utterly dependent upon the written Word of God apart from any outward manifestations or physical experiences.<br>

I feel that the tongues movement is a cohesive element which seems to further the ecumenical movement, which has compromise as its foundation. If Babylon is to be rebuilt, perhaps this babble is the root or foundation of this event. Satan can counterfeit the Spirit of God, and we see the evidence on every hand.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a student, I first read <em>Present Truth Magazine</em> on the recommendation of one of my instructors. I'm very impressed with your stand on the Word alone and with your emphasis on justification by faith. I've been very disturbed by the subjective, experiential, Pentecostal trend on our campus. It seems to be spreading like an epidemic. I know that several students and most of the faculty share my concern. We have become acquainted with <em>Present Truth Magazine,</em> and we have been gaining perspective on the implications of justification by faith and on its meaning. We've also been seeing the very real dangers in subjectivism and our obligation, as dorm counselors, to combat this both in our personal lives and in our ministries.<em> Present Truth Magazine</em> has been a real help in pointing out the danger and in providing a solidly Biblical foundation. We'll keep recommending your magazine to those we meet.<br>

I'm a student at a Christian college and have found strength and assurance in your stand for the gospel of grace. It isn't often heard with clarity.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You do not know which way the wind (Holy Spirit) is blowing. You have quite a job on your hands, for this charismatic movement is of God, and no man can stop it! God said that in the last days He would pour out His Spirit on all flesh. If you had ever been to a charismatic service and felt the beautiful presence of God, you couldn't print <em>Present Truth magazine.</em><br>

    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is tragic that in a day and age such as ours, when Christians are finally beginning to love and accept each other, you have nothing better to do than publish a magazine, the entire contents of which only speak against movements that differ from you. Even though I may agree with some of the magazine's content, I think it is one of the most divisive things I have seen!<br>

You claim that Pentecostals promote their experience above Jesus Christ. How is it possible to exalt our Lord when you are constantly attacking the beliefs of Pentecostalism and Catholicism&mdash;both Christian beliefs? Is unity to be gained by constantly fighting those who are in opposition against you.  Your  method  of &quot;guilt  by association&quot;&mdash;associating Pentecostalism with the evils of Catholicism&mdash;is sickening.<br>
