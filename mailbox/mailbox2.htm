        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color=maroon>The Question of Authority</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your issue of <em>Present Truth Magazine</em> on "<a href="../archive/X/index.htm" target="_blank">The Question of Authority</a>" was a fine, most needed presentation. Every issue continues to hit today's theological sore spots.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It occurred to me that the real reason that many do not respect the law of God is because they do not accept the authority of Scripture. You rightly say on page 12, "The great issue today is authority&mdash;the authority of God's Word versus the authority of human experience." This holds true for the emotional, revivalistic people of whom there are many. But what about the vast numbers who are emotionally sane but who allow reason to dominate their "Christian" philosophy? I feel another great issue today is the authority of God's Word versus the authority of human reason (2 Cor. 10:5). Those who follow human experience and those who follow human reason for the most part follow a different brand of "Christianity." The first group generally pervert the Scriptures by their literalism. The more literally they take everything in the Bible, the prouder they are of their loyal stand. The second group mutilate the Word of God by making anything contrary to human reason figurative. This gives them room in their thinking for all kinds of permissiveness, situation ethics, etc., along with their isagogics (JEDP source theory, very late dating of the book of Daniel to eliminate prophecy, denial of many miracles, etc.). After all, justification by faith in the last analysis stands or falls depending on man's acceptance or rejection of the authority of God's Word versus the authority of human reason.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Words cannot express how much I appreciate the fine articles found within the pages of <em>Present Truth Magazine</em>. I was nurtured on dispensational teaching but had always harbored questions in my mind concerning such passages as Romans 7 and the relationship of law to grace. Your October, 1973 issue on "<a href="../archive/X/index.htm" target="_blank">The Question of Authority</a>" has done much to remove the scales from my eyes.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I believe you have missed the grace and law issue Romans 8:4 tells me that all of God's laws have been fulfilled in me, not by me. It appears that you are almost putting the Holy Spirit out of a job. Sanctification does not come through my efforts but by the work of the Spirit.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I share with you the belief that much attention must be given to the Pentecostal movement to understand and refute it where it has abandoned the Word of God. <em>Sola Scriptura</em> is the only foundation on which this can be done, not only for the charismatics but for any other error that has been taught in and by the visible church.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I find your magazine a tragic farce supposedly composed in the service of truth. In your foreword you suggest that <i>sola gratia</i>, <i>solo Christo</i>, <i>sola fide</i> and <i>sola Scriptura</i> are the basic norms of genuine truth, and the rest of your magazine then proceeds to censure or castigate those who expound ideas which do not jibe with your particular norms. But what says that your norms are the proper measure of truth other than select passages which you have isolated in your Scriptures? What would it be like if the people of other religions were to use the same principle to demonstrate the truth of their claims? Isn't that the same as saying that what we say is true because the books which our people have written suggest that it is true?</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would suggest that you re-examine the premises on which you have built your ministry. And unless you can find a more objective standard from which to elucidate the real nature of the human condition, don't go publishing it as "present truth."<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I received your special issue of <em>Present Truth Magazine</em>, "<a href="../archive/V/index.htm" target="_blank">Justification by Faith and the Charismatic Movement.</a>" I have never obtained such a misquoting, misconstruing piece of material in my life.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The apostle Paul nowhere suggested that all believers receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit immediately upon receiving Christ. There are many references to the baptism of the Holy Spirit being a very definite and separate experience evidenced in such a way that in each instance all who were there knew that those who received the Spirit had been filled.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your felonious accusation that we Pentecostals have placed experience above justification by faith is as ignorant and twisted an assumption as I've ever heard. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is not above salvation, but it is a second step in which we are endued with that power to witness as spoken by our Lord. </font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nowhere in the New Testament does it say that all believers were filled. It does say, however, that the gift of the Holy Spirit is for all believers.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am interested in the way you clearly point out the difference between the objective and subjective gospel&mdash;something which I was never aware of.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have seen many people who started out looking only to Christ but were then carried away in the charismatic movement by the promise of greater blessings in the "second blessing." From that time on they are more interested in the great experiences they are having, and their great desire is to lead others into this experience instead of leading others to Christ.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you will take from me an honest word of testimony, it is this: Since coming into the baptism in the Holy Spirit, I believe that I have more love for God, my fellow Christians and non-Christians than I had before. I am a happier and a more stable Christian. In the last four years the Lord has used me to lead more souls to Christ than in all the previous 26 years of my Christian life before I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</font> </p>

I think a better representation of what I see would be, "Dedicated to the discrediting of the Pentecostal movement."</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I see the following trends coming from the Pentecostal movement that thrill me and represent what I feel to be "New Testament Christianity":</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Greater honor given to Jesus Christ&mdash;the baptizer.</font> </p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I do not anymore belong to any denomination, but I do belong to the body of Christ. There are many levels of truth that the Holy Spirit is bringing the body through. One of these for me was the charismatic movement. Today the Spirit is showing deeper truths to many. However, if this charismatic movement is not of God, it will fail. If it is, you are fighting against the Holy Spirit. I believe you are on very dangerous ground. I will ask the Holy Spirit to guide you into all truth.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have tried to read your magazine with an open mind, and I find it hard to even address your magazine as <em>Present Truth</em>. A more appropriate title would be<em> Present Error.</em> You state your purpose to be that of bringing the churches back to the truth of justification by faith, and charge that the charismatic movement is tearing down the great doctrines of the Bible. This leads me to believe that you have never attended a Pentecostal church, for no one preaches justification by faith any more strongly than the Pentecostal movement. This is only one of a multitude of errors and half truths I find in your publication. It would be well if you would do your homework before you attempt to correct others.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was brought up in the Pentecostal movement. I have seen it firsthand as a child.

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although a member of the Church of the Nazarene since early youth, I am very "excited" about Reformation theology as presented by your magazine?</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several years ago I became disenchanted with holiness teaching concerning "backsliding" and "entire sanctification." It seems to me that holiness theology limits the power of the gospel. Now I am convinced that, of all the doctrines I have studied, Reformation theology is the most accurate and objective understanding of the gospel.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My personal religious experience and observation of Christians who profess(ed) "entire sanctification" are more compatible with Reformation theology than with holiness theology. I have sought the "crisis experience" of "entire sanctification" but never "felt" that I had received it. Reformation theology has strengthened my faith by exposing the subjective and introspective nature of holiness theology.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me commend you for the effort you are making in alerting the church to the dangers of subjective religion in all of its expressions. While I haven't reconciled all of your historical analyses of Christian movements, nor does it appear to me that the form of holiness doctrine attacked resembles the teaching of most present day holiness churches, I enjoy the reading very much.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I've observed the currents of theological trends obscuring authentic Christian faith, they appear threefold:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Dead humanitarian pseudo-Christianity devoid of the great supernatural objective affirmations of the faith.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Pentecostalism and its attendant "sea of subjectivism" and superspirituality.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Dispensationalism and the prophetic tangents of Hal Lindsey and others on the sensationalized eschatological kick.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The liberals have been pretty well silenced by the evangelical orthodox resurgence. You and others have done an admirable job of dealing with the charismatic plague. But I've seen little in the major journals dealing with the follies of Scofield and company. Such a large segment of evangelical Christianity has gotten swept into focusing on "Israel's prophetic time clock" that it has become quite diversionary and leads to quite heretical inferences. Some lucid tracing of this movement from the 1840's and its untenable hermeneutics would be a real service to your readers.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you for sending a copy of <em>Present Truth Magazine</em>. At first glance the magazine looked as if it were only a piece of anti-Roman polemic; it almost landed in the church wastebasket. But, having read your publication, let me thank you for providing some good, sound and perceptively corrective Reformed theology.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The clarity with which <em>Present Truth Magazine</em> articles are written, the simple yet profound insights set forth, and the relegation of the disease of religious subjectivity to its proper place, are combined to make yours a Christian periodical above and beyond all others. I have recommended <em>Present Truth</em> to both lay and clergy acquaintances and will continue to do so.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have received the special issue of your magazine entitled, "<a href="../archive/V/index.htm" target="_blank">Justification by Faith and the Charismatic Movement</a>." From my limited experience with Pentecostals, I am not sure that what you describe them to be exactly coincides with my perception of them. But I must agree with the substance of what you have said and applaud you for articulating what has distressed me lately, viz., the rank subjectivism of present day Christians.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the lead editorial, "New Reformation Aborning?" in the October 26 issue of <em>Christianity Today</em>, the statement is made that even though substantial numbers of people, young and old, in Europe as well as in North America, have been converted through evangelistic endeavors, it cannot be said that many of these converts understand or appreciate the church's Reformation heritage. The editorial concludes that there may be a new Reformation aborning somewhere, perhaps in some obscure place, that will erupt suddenly and dramatically. If there is time for such a new Reformation, I will be surprised if the work you are doing does not turn out to be in its vanguard.<br>
