<p><font color="#993333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Rocks and Bouquets </strong></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Mr. Kidman, a great Australian cattleman, was asleep. Someone was trying to arouse him, calling, "Mr. Kidman, Mr. Kidman." No response. Whereupon an acquaintance of Kidman said, "If you want to wake him up, just call out, 'Bullocks.'" That did it! </em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>When Calvinists are asleep, just call out, "Election," and they're up and ready to fight. That's great! As we said in our September issue on "Election," our columns are open for Reformed comments -for rocks as well as bouquets. -Ed. </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#993333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Yea and Nay</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have received your recent issue of <em>Present Truth Magazine. </em>As always, I find your lead article ("<a href="../archive/XXVII/27-2.htm" target="_blank">The Legal and Moral Aspects of Salvation</a>," Part 3) challenging. I have not seen a more lucid exposition of the doctrine of election properly understood than in this article. I see no point (although I may after I reread and more carefully analyze some of your statements) on which we differ, although I subscribe to the "five points" of the Synod of Dort, which you apparently do not. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I do not share your view on "regeneration." I do believe that this must be first in the <em>ordo salutis, </em>although I concur with you that this is not the born-again experience as some teach. I see regeneration as a divine work of the Holy Spirit to give seeing eyes and a believing heart by a sovereign act of grace that men might hear and believe the gospel and be justified and born anew. I see the new birth as belonging to the doctrine of sanctification (correct me if I'm wrong).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You continue to bless me by your ministry. I shall ever be grateful to God for using your publication to help in crystallizing my final deliverance from the subjective trap of the Pentecostal and holiness movement.</font></p>

<hr width="300" size=1 align="left"><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: I regret that it is necessary to write in the tone I must. I retract what I said in my last letter. I have taken time to read what you said on election, and I must state that I totally deplore what you are now revealing your stand to be.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will not go out of my way to "fight" you. However, in conscience I must oppose you to all who inquire of me, and I feel it my duty before the Lord to issue warning to the Reformed community of believers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">/ <em>hope you have not jumped out of the Pentecostal fire into the refrigerator of a closed system.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Up until now I have almost unreservedly endorsed <em>Present Truth Magazine. </em>Although you have made mistakes in the past (your views of repetitious justifications, your <em>ordo salutis, </em>and your ecumenical ideas on fellowship in the church, for three examples), I have been able to justify my support by the overwhelming correctness of your views on justification, sanctification, hermeneutics and eschatology. Now, however, you have gone too far. Not only do you misunderstand election in Christ, but you attack logic, reprove Peter De Jong for saying that "God clearly foreordains evil" (Cf. Isaiah, who said that "I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside Me. . . . I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things," (Isa. 45:5, 7), tout Barth and Richardson, and generally confuse the doctrine of election with something completely foreign to Scripture. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From now on when I distribute any of your literature (I will <em>not </em>be distributing the <a href="../archive/XXVII/index.htm" target="_blank">Election</a> issue), I will caution the recipients to be on their guard against certain unscriptural and illogical positions that you take. I suggest that you devote the entire next issue of <em>Present Truth Magazine to </em> corrections of your heterodox opinions presented in the Election issue.</font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#993333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Heresy! </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: It is incomprehensible to me that the same magazine which gave us "Nothing But the Gospel" in May could give us nothing but heresy in September. I lavished praise upon your magazine only five months ago when you gave the clearest presentation of the gospel I have read in a long while, but now I am shocked at how unscholarly you are in your handling of Calvinism's doctrine of election. You are so bold as to offer <em>Present Truth Magazine </em>as an alternative to Arminianism, yet the distinguishing features you present are only cosmetic. Arminianism all decked out in your polemical and condescending style, then wrapped in a pretty pastel green cover, is still only Arminianism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You charge that election is unpreachable and that it is not preached from Reformed pulpits, yet here in the heart of Arminian territory are four churches where not only election but all five points of TULIP are freely and unapologetically preached. Only a few years ago there was just one Calvinistic voice in this area. Calvinism is experiencing a revival.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In answer to your charge that Reformed leaders go about like an "orthodoxy patrol" searching out Arminianism and attacking it wherever it is found, let me just ask <em>Present Truth Magazine </em>this question: What are you doing with your many and frequent assaults on all that smacks of Romanism, subjectivism, neo-Pentecostalism and dispensationalism?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout your issue ("secretion" would be a better word) on "<a href="../archive/XXVII/index.htm" target="_blank">Election</a>" you criticize the Calvinist's reliance upon logic. Would you have us believe that we cannot expect Scripture to be logical? Are the mystics correct? Are the holiest doctrines those which are least logical? Try to prove the doctrine of the Trinity without applying logic. Try formulating an eschatology without applying logic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I could go through September's <em>Present Truth </em>and find many places where you have so totally misrepresented the Calvinism I know that I can only conclude that your Calvinistic acquaintances are imposters. The very fact that you believe Reformed preachers are not preaching election is proof that the Reformed preachers you know are Reformed in name only. When a man believes something, he will preach it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, I would be interested to know why your publication has found it expedient to lean so heavily upon Martin Luther in past issues, and yet in this issue you have attributed TULIP to only Augustine, Calvin and a few others, neglecting the fact that Luther too was highly predestinarian. To those who would affirm "free will" and deny election, Luther had this to say:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Eventually, we will come to this: that men may be saved and damned without God's knowledge! For He will not have marked out by sure election those that should be saved and those that should be damned; He will merely have set before all men His general longsuffering, which forbears and hardens, together with His chastening and punishing mercy, and left it to them to choose whether they would be saved or damned, while He Himself, perchance, goes off, as Homer says, to an Ethiopian banquet! - <em>The Bondage of the Will.</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The September issue on "<a href="../archive/XXVII/index.htm" target="_blank">Election</a>" was excellent! My eyes have been opened, and I've been freed from the bonds of Calvinism. Robert Brinsmead's article on "The Legal and Moral Aspects of Salvation" (Part 3) gave me a new insight into the doctrine of atonement and reopened my desire in evangelism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Present Truth Magazine <em>is certainly not anti-Calvin. It is the </em>ism <em>on the end of </em>Calvin <em>that has sometimes brought about a closed system which has made further progress difficult.

<p><strong><font color="#993333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One-sided Bungling</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been getting <em>Present Truth Magazine </em> for a number of years now and have received a great deal of good information from it. The articles on justification and sanctification have been super. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whenever you get off these subjects, your errors are pathetic to say the least. Your articles against dispensationalism and millennialism are something else.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One case in point is the September issue on "<a href="../archive/XXVII/index.htm" target="_blank">Election</a>." Since my background has been somewhat in the Reformed tradition, my interest in this subject has caused me to study it in depth. I do not propose to have all the answers, but I have never read such one-sided bungling of the subject in my life. The last article by Alan Richardson is chief of the bunglers. When he must quote from Esdras and use scriptures that have nothing to do with the point, he is indeed hard up for proof of his point of view.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since it takes "a book to answer a book," I do not have the time nor the inclination to answer all the errors in this issue. I am just writing you to let you know that here is one reader who cannot swallow all you teach. Sorry about that! </font></p>

<p><font color="#993333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Candid Approach</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Robert Brinsmead's series on "<a href="../archive/XXVII/27-2.htm" target="_blank">The Legal and Moral Aspects of Salvation</a>" was one of your best efforts to date. Part 3 on election was a clear presentation of a doctrine that is oftentimes most difficult. Mr. Brinsmead displayed an uncanny ability to cut across denominational lines to arrive at the truth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I do not always agree with your material, but I do appreciate your candid approach. Do keep up the good work.</font></p>

<p><font color="#993333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Stimulating</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As many are saying, I too express appreciation for the stimulating nature of your magazine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The "redemption of human nature" doctrine expounded in Brinsmead's article in the September issue of <em>Present Truth </em>is pure universalism and denies John 6:39, John 17:9, and many other scriptures which show Christ's effective and definite atonement. He died and arose to accomplish salvation for those given to Him by the Father, not to merely make it available.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The word which to me sums up all the arguments in the "<a href="../archive/XXVII/index.htm" target="_blank">Election</a>" issue is <em>initiative. </em>Brinsmead, Runia, Kuitert and Richardson, as all the king's men, can't put it all together. They will not swallow a holy, sovereign, <em>deterministic God, </em>but they opt, with the humanists, for a <em>deterministic man. </em></font></p>

(Dan. 4:35).</font></p>
</blockquote><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With all of your elegance of language, you have only managed to reproduce a refined version of free-willism. Someone has to be God. To be God is to be the Determiner. Truly Reformed men see God's unstayed hand on every page of Scripture and rejoice in it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If genuinely Reformed scholars wanted to gather a series of articles setting forth true Lutheranism, would you be pleased if they were all drawn from a body such as the Lutheran Church in America ? You have chosen writers who, at best, are on the periphery of the Reformed community. </font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#993333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Far Short</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was not surprised to read the recent articles in your September issue on the subject of "<a href="../archive/XXVII/index.htm" target="_blank">Election</a>." But I was disappointed to see how far short the message of your magazine falls from a "restoration of New Testament Christianity in this generation." Your Barthian view of election is not the view of the Reformation in general nor that of Luther in particular. I'm sure that many semi-Pelagians of our day will have their error fortified and continue to reject the clear teaching of the Word of God. Election is with reference to Christ, but it is still an election of individuals in Christ. Ephesians 1:4 says, " . . . according as He hath chosen <em>us </em>in Him..." Even that text, as well as many others, points to the election of individuals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since you agree with Barth's view of election, it makes me even more suspicious than before whether you do not also agree with his view of universalism. Why not give us a clear answer on this?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Please look again at my qualifying remarks on Barth in the "Editorial Introduction" to the September issue of </em>Present Truth Magazine. <em>I'm not Barthian. But often those who criticize Barth most have never really read what he said but have only read someone else who read what someone else said he said. Barth was not a universalist. I certainly am not. All articles in </em>Present Truth Magazine <em>do not necessarily reflect the view of the editor. We were simply wanting to inform our readers of different efforts to rework the doctrine of election. If we are committed to a closed system of theology, it makes it difficult to dispassionately consider any point of view which differs from our own. &#8212;Ed. </em></font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#993333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Troubled </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: I have appreciated your articles in <em>Present Truth Magazine </em>for quite some time. However, I am greatly troubled by Part 3 of "<a href="../archive/XXVII/27-2.htm" target="_blank">The Legal and Moral As&shy;pects of Salvation</a>," which appeared in the September issue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On page 14 you write, "In Christ humanity is already justified and freed (Rom. 5:18 ; 6:7)." If <em>all </em>humanity is already justified, then it must rightly follow that <em>all </em>humanity shall like&shy;wise be sanctified and glorified, for the Scriptures do not separate these elements one from another (see Rom. 8:30 ; 1 Cor. 1:30 ).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If all mankind are justified in Christ, why then do some fail to believe and therefore are not saved, not sanctified and not glorified? The only way that you may come to this conclusion is by redefining what it means to be justified. Justification means "to be declared legally righteous." But your position would cause you to define justification as "to provide us an opportunity to become legally righteous." Yet such doctrine is not taught in the Scriptures. Nor has it ever, to my knowledge, been adopted by the Reformers.</font></p>

  Reformed Presbyterian Pastor</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  California</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>I did not say "all humanity" but simply "humanity." Christ assumed human nature (humanity), and in Him that human nature (humanity) is justified and glorified. All individuals are now invited to believe this and share its benefits. </em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>The biblical expression "in Christ" is used in two ways: (1) what God did in Christ (i.e., in His Person) before we came to faith; </em>(2) <em>individual faith-union with Christ. &#8212;Ed. </em></font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#993333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His and Hers</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: Please permit me to make a comment on your magazine. I have appreciated many of your articles and gleaned many helpful ideas to balance my thinking on justification. However, a statement made in your September issue on "<a href="../archive/XXVII/index.htm" target="_blank">Election</a>" sets very sour with your previous teaching on justification. That statement reads, "In Christ humanity is already justified and freed." </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Romans 5:18 is a scripture that speaks of the <em>modus operandi </em>of justification. Its meaning is clear. All that are in Adam are condemned, and all that are in Christ are justified. Moreover, these two groups (in Adam, in Christ) are not identical. One group is spiritually dead (those in the flesh or Adam), and one is spiritually alive (those in Christ) (Rom. 5:12 ; 1 Cor. 15:22 ; Eph. 2:1-5). These two groups coexist in the world (John 17:6, 9; 1 John 5:19 ; Rom. 8:7-9; 1 Cor. 2:14 ). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you mean by your interpretation of Romans 5:18 that humanity now shares in Christ's nature by virtue of His incarnation and that this incarnation abrogates its previous link to Adam by nature, you are badly mistaken. If you mean that the elect share in Christ's nature by virtue of justification, then you must admit to spiritual life in all those who are justified (2 Peter 1:3, 4). This is because justification brings (is unto) a new nature (life), adoption into the family of God, and consequently the elect begin to call upon the Lord as Abba, Father. Humanity's unbelief and unholiness is symptomatic of the fact that it is not freed from its sinful nature inherited from Adam and therefore is not justified. Since you believe that justification results in rebirth and consequently freedom, you are inconsistent by teaching, "In Christ all humanity is already justified and freed." You are also inconsistent with the Reformed teaching of justification. May I remind you of your often-quoted statement from a Reformer of the past, "Christ justifies no one whom He does not at the same time sanctify" (Rom. 6:22 ; 1 Cor. 1:30 ). </font></p>
<hr width="300" size=1 align="left">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: On the one hand I am already persuaded that we should "prove all things and hold to that which is good" (1 Thess. 5:21 ; Acts 17:11 ). On the other hand I am also persuaded that we should defend the faith which was once delivered to the saints.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bennett Broadway<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">California</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>My article did not say </em>"all <em>humanity" as if justification and freedom were the personal possession of each individual. What it says is this: Christ assumed the human nature common to all men. In Him that human nature or humanity is justified and freed&#8212;and glorified as well. The atonement and its individual application by the work of the Holy Spirit and Christ's intercession are separate events.&#8212;Ed. </em></font></p>
<hr width="300" size=1 align="left">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: I wish to protest against the idea of election you present in your September issue of <em>Present Truth. </em>In particular I would cite Mr. H. M. Kuitert's article. Mr. Kuitert's article, entitled "<a href="../archive/XXVII/27-5.htm" target="_blank">Election Means Preference</a>," seeks to justify God's preference by the worthy objects of His choice. Mr. Kuitert says: "He prefers the lost, the publicans and sinners, the sick and rejected. In a word He prefers all those in need of His saving hand."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Kuitert's attempt to explain away "the most offensive word [election] in the vocabulary of the Church" shows that he himself does not trust in the mercy of God (Rom. 9:15-16); neither is he tolerant of God's sovereign counsel and the good pleasure or kind intention of His will (Eph. 1:1-14; 2 Tim. 1:9; Rom. 9:20-24; 11:33-36). Let God be God!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any time you place God's preference in the creature or a quality in the creature (humility, downtrodden, outcast), you are doing the equivalent of the Arminians, who place God's preference in the foreseen faith in the creature. Maybe we should take Mr. M. Luther seriously when he warns us of the legalism in our bones!</font></p>

<p><font color="#993333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Timely </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: What a timely issue on "<a href="../archive/XXVII/index.htm" target="_blank">Election</a>"! You should have greater readership because you really are spear&shy;heading "the truth" of the Reformation. Your September issue is just the thing for us to celebrate the "festival of the Reformation."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Romans 8:24 "we are saved by hope." So why not &quot;out-Luther&quot; Luther and go beyond the Reformation to a "theology of hope" based solely on the "holy Word of God"? Are you going to discuss hope in any upcoming issue? I hope so! </font></p>

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Washington </font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#993333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thoughtful Letter </font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: Having been forewarned by the editorial comment, "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good," in the August issue of <em>Present Truth Magazine, </em>I read Prof. Mueller's article on "The Meaning of Grace" with care. Unfortunately, Prof. Mueller is not as well acquainted with Calvinism as he is with the Latin language. Prof. Mueller's views are incorrect. The Synod of Dort did not deny the true universality of the gospel offer but rather strongly affirmed it. I quote Article 18 of the Third and Fourth Heads of Doctrine: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As many as are called by the Gospel are unfeignedly called; for God hath most earnestly and truly declared in His Word what will be acceptable to Him, namely, that all who are called should comply with His invitation. He, moreover, seriously promises eternal life and rest to as many as shall come to Him and believe on Him."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, the Synod of Dort never declared that God's grace is "irresistible" but rather that God's calling of men to repentance and faith is "effectual." In affirming this, Dort uses almost the same language as the Lutheran Confessions. Dort says,". . . by the efficacy of the same regenerating Spirit, He pervades the inmost recesses of the heart; He opens the closed and softens the hardened heart, and circumcises that which was uncircumcised The Lutheran Augsburg Confession, in Article V, states, " . . . For by the Word and Sacraments, as by instruments, the Holy Spirit is given; who worketh faith, <em>where and when it pleaseth God, </em>in those that hear the Gospel. The Formula of Concord agrees with Dort when it denies that grace is given to unwilling men, "For God in conversion of unwilling men makes willing men, and dwells with the willing, as Augustine is wont to speak."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What Prof. Mueller does not realize is that "particularism" is not something that John Calvin or the Synod of Dort or the Westminster Assembly invented. It is found in Scripture. It is true that it does not appear in the apostolic proclamation of the gospel to the unsaved <em>(euangellid&shy;zein), </em>but it is frequently found in the teaching <em>(didaskein) </em>of the gospel to the church. It is a definite part of the <em>kerygma. </em>At Pentecost, Peter called upon the multitude to "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house." But as Luke sums up the work of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost: ". . . and the Lord added to the church daily, such as should be saved" (literal translation from the Greek, " ... and the Lord added those being saved according to the day upon the same"). When the Gentiles responded to the gospel, Luke reports, ". . . and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed" (Acts 13:48 ). Particularism is an inseparable part of Paul's salu&shy;tation in Ephesians 1:4, 5: "... according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world . . . having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ." As one of my professors at Western Theological Seminary used to say, "Virtually every reference to predestination in the New Testament is a doxology." Particularism is part of the praise of the church. There are, of course, alternatives to particularism; they are Arminianism and Pelagianism. Either God is in total charge of His plan of salvation or God is not in charge at all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I must confess that in the hands of some men particularism became something quite different from what it is from the pen and lips of our Saviour and His apostles. The "hyper-Calvin&shy;ist" does indeed distort the gospel, and from sad experience I know how gross that distortion can become. It is not just, however, to attribute this distortion to Calvin. He says in his Treatise on Election, &quot;I would by no means drive you to the secret election of God, to seek your salvation from thence, as it were, with open mouths, but I would exhort you to flee directly to Christ, in whom salvation is laid before our eyes."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a Calvinist and an "Infralapsarian," I heartily regret the excesses of some of my Christian brethren who call themselves Calvinists, but I regret even more the singular ineptness with which otherwise competent theologians speak about Calvin and Calvinism. As one of my professors at Hope College once remarked, "Most of the people who talk about John Calvin heard about him from somebody else who never got around to reading Calvin either."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both Calvinism and Lutheranism are Augustinian theologies, and Calvin and Calvinism owes much to Martin Luther and is not ashamed to acknowledge this debt. I hope the day may soon come when the polemical attitude of Lutheran theologians may be replaced by a sincere effort to see and understand the basic unity of Calvin and Luther in their mutual insistence that justification by faith must be justification only by God's grace in Jesus Christ, plus nothing.</font></p>

Mueller's criticism of Calvinism was a remark on the side which I was tempted to edit out, but that too would have invited criticism. Mueller's definition of grace as being something outside of the believer entirely is the main thrust of his article and is beautifully presented. &#8212;Ed. </em></font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#993333" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Caution</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: I have read every issue of your magazine and heard you speak many times. I distribute <em>Present Truth Magazine </em>with every issue. You and <em>Present Truth Magazine </em>are truly raised up for this day. May you long continue your ministry. And I trust you will use some caution regarding the printing of certain articles which tend to confuse rather than enlighten. These are written by others, not yourselves. Allow me to refer to two that appeared in two recent issues, and the only two such articles I have noticed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In your July issue I refer to the article by Jon Zens, "<a href="../archive/XXV/25-3.htm" target="_blank">Why Existential Theology Is Bankrupt</a>." Zens has something to say, but he confuses the reader with what he thinks is scholarship. By that I mean his use of every philosophical and theological word he learned in seminary. This is characteristic of his seminary, Westminster of Philadelphia. I can only excuse him because he seems to be a relatively young man. You should have known better than to publish such obfuscation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second article I refer to is in your August issue. It is "<a href="../archive/XXVI/26-3.htm" target="_blank">The Meaning of Grace</a>," by John T. Mueller. I could have guessed he was a Lutheran by his attempt at scholarship through the overly abundant use of the Latin. Obviously, communication was not his goal. It is really a bit ostentatious to use Latin in a day when even proper English is on the decline. Mueller does put his finger on a critical problem, but he avoids facing it. He recognizes that unbelief is at the root of the mystery of saved or not saved. But he fails to indicate how one comes to belief. The Scriptures seem to be clear enough on this count: when the Holy Spirit accompanies the preaching of the gospel, then faith ensues, resulting in salvation, and never otherwise. Ephesians 2:8 seems crystal clear on this point: faith is the gift of God. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In conclusion, let me say that Zens, a Baptist, and Mueller, a Lutheran, hail from traditions that have held the truth of justification by faith from the days of the Reformation. But as you see, they becloud the grand doctrine rather than clarify and communicate it. I advise my friends to be careful of their articles for this reason. I encourage you to pursue the truth in the excellent way you have done, without their kind of "help." </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: I am surprised (to say the least!) that you chose to print Mr. Mueller's article, "<a href="../archive/XXVI/26-3.htm" target="_blank">The Meaning of Grace</a>," in your August issue. He tosses the term "efficacious grace" around as if it were a newborn baby crying out to be embraced but only being received by a concerned nurse once in a while. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mueller said that the favor of God in Christ, our Mediator, extends to all men without exception (p. 18). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God says that Christ entreated God's favor only upon the "given ones," those who will believe (John </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17:9-10, 20-21). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mueller said that God earnestly wills every individual to be saved (p. 18).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God says that He only wills those who wilt believe to be saved (John 6:38 -40). "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him [not "that every individual"] should not perish, but have eternal life" (John 3:16 ). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mueller said that God's pleasure is that every man be saved (pp. 18-19), and thus man can cause God 's pleasure not to be accomplished. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God says: "I am God and there is none else.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: The article, "<a href="../archive/XXVI/26-3.htm" target="_blank">The Meaning of Grace</a>" in the August Issue of <em>Present Truth Magazine </em>, was very much confused. The author never did explain or give a biblical answer to his topic. He quoted Luther often but obviously does not agree with him. It is obvious that the author does not believe in faith alone for salvation because he states that there is the means of grace (the Word and the sacraments). Therefore he seems to say (if I can weed it out from the wordy mass) that salvation is by faith, plus baptism, plus communion. I'm convinced that this man is confused on the basis of salvation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: You say repeatedly, "Let us reason together." In my opinion that is very necessary with regard to what <a href="../archive/XXVI/26-3.htm" target="_blank">John T. Mueller</a> writes in your issue of August, pages 18-19. I have never read such a superficial "attack" on the Reformed position. It is an attack that is in many respects incorrect and flagrantly contradicts the Conclusion of the Canons of Dort, which, for example, "detest with their whole soul" the idea that "in the same manner in which the election is the fountain and cause of faith and good works, reprobation is the cause of unbelief and impiety." </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much more could be mentioned. It just doesn't do to hide in "an unsolvable mystery" (p. 19) while the Scriptures speak so clearly about faith as a gift of God ("it is given to you to believe") and call the believers "the elect." If Mueller would place this "elect" after a person has believed, he would find himself in the camp of the Arminians! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because you want to reason together, you should invite a Reformed theologian to write his answer to Mueller. I would suggest Prof. Dr. J. Faber of the Canadian Reformed Theological Seminary. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir: Regarding Dr. Mueller's article, "<a href="../archive/XXVI/26-3.htm" target="_blank">The Meaning of Grace</a>," in your August issue: I am more interested in what I agree with in Dr. Mueller than wherein I differ. My Robinson grandparents were members of Daniel's Lutheran Church a few miles north of Lincolnton , North Carolina . Their pastor baptized me. I graduated from Roanoke (a Lutheran college) and attended classes in Gettysburg Seminary (Pennsylvania ) but have been in the Presbyterian Church all my life.</font></p>

In fact, we were tempted to edit it out because of the danger of its being distracting. Mueller's insight into the extrinsic nature of saving grace and its distinction from the gifts of grace was, in our opinion, beautifully presented.

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* * * * * </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As one who has been blessed by your writings and who holds to the Westminster Standards, may I suggest that your difference with Dr. Gordon Clark (see <a href="../archive/XXVII/27-3.htm" target="_blank">Sept. issue, pp. 15-17</a>) is at least in part a matter of terminology. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In John 3 our Lord says one must be born of the Spirit in order to see the things of the kingdom. This evidently means that the Spirit works in him to believe in the Son of God freely offered in John 3:16. Now Paul seems to mean the same thing with his term "called" (1 Cor. 1:26f.; 2 Tim. 1:9-10; Rom. 8:30 ). According to the last reference, this call precedes justification. It seemed to the Westminster divines that what Calvin sets forth in his <em>Institutes </em>, Book 3, chapter 1 (the illumination of the Holy Spirit) and chapter 2 (faith), was what was meant by being born of the Spirit (John 3) and being "called" in Paul's letters. Therefore they called it "effectual calling." </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This means that the illumination of the Spirit which we call faith precedes justification. In the same Westminster Confession justification is treated prior to sanctification.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Calvin puts justification and sanctification as coterminous in his <em>Institutes </em>, Book 3, chapter 16, section 1; chapter 14, section 9; and chapter 11, section 11. In the first of these (chap. 16, sec. 1) he seems to put justification logically prior to sanctification but both of them after "illumination by His wisdom" &#8212;which is what Westminster meant by effectual calling (cf. 1 Cor. 1:30 , where Christ as our wisdom from God precedes both righteousness and sanctification). The other two references from the <em>Institutes </em>, Book 3, also keep together justification and regeneration or sanctification or reformation into newness of life. Thus it seems to me that Calvin uses regeneration in the <em>Institutes </em>, Book 3, chapter 16, section 1; chapter 14, section 9; and chapter 11, section 11, in the sense of sanctification. Thus he puts sanctification logically after justification as does the Westminster Confession.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I do not insist that this solves the difference but suggest that it ameliorates it. As by fraternal discussion we shake the lamp of truth, may it shine the brighter! [ <em>Beautiful! -Ed. </em>] </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Principal John Macleod's <em>Scottish Theology in Connection with Church History </em> there is a discussion of the <em>ordo salutis </em>as set forth by two different Reformed theologians- one saying that justification precedes regeneration, and the other vice versa. I no longer have this fine book in my retirement. Your own scholarship is magnificent!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* * * * * </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regarding "<a href="../archive/XXVII/27-3.htm" target="_blank">The Order of Justification and Regeneration</a>" in your September issue: May I suggest that your criticism of seventeenth-century Calvinism is more applicable to the Canons of Dort, while Dr. Gordon Clark's reply is a defense of the Westminster Standards. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dort has a number of references to regeneration but no chapter on justification. Westminster makes only one reference to regeneration, and that in its chapter on sanctification. It does not state whether regeneration is prior to or later than justification, which is treated two chapters earlier. On the other hand, Westminster has a strong chapter on justification and six catechetical questions thereon. According to Westminster , God justifies sinners "not for anything wrought in them or done by them but only for the perfect obedience and full satisfaction of Christ by God imputed to them and received by faith alone." &#8212;L.C. 70. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Where Calvin treats of regeneration and justification ( <em>Institutes </em>, Bk. 3, chap. 11, secs. 6, 11; chap. 14, sec. 9; chap 16, sec. 1), he uses regeneration in the sense of sanctification, that is, reformation into newness of life by gradual progression, bestowing the Spirit of adoption, by whose power He remakes us into His own image, so that by His power the lusts of the flesh are more and more mortified and we are sanctified. Now this is what Westminster means by sanctification, and its chapter thereon follows that on justification. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Westminster regularly calls the initial step "effectual calling." This term evidently comes from Paul's frequent use of "called" and takes up Calvin's illumination of the Spirit (<em>Institutes</em>, Bk. 3, chap. 1) and faith (chap. 2). God works it "by His Word and Spirit." According to Romans 8:30, "Those whom God calls He also justifies," and this seems to be the order in 1 Corinthians 1:26 , 30 and Titus 3:5-7. Let's not push our logic so far as to condemn those who seriously think they are following the Word. </font></p>

    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I appreciate your firm hold on &quot;justification by faith (alone)&quot; as being a judicial declaration. However, I sense a lack of warmth in this one sided approach. Justification by faith is fine, but it is only half the picture. Sanctification by the Holy Spirit is the other half. I do not believe in the &quot;primacy of justification.&quot;<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I appreciate your objective stand taken in connection with your dissemination of &quot;the Truth of God as it is in Christ Jesus our Lord according to the Holy Scriptures (both Testaments).&quot; Your faithful propagation of propositional biblical truth as conceived and circulated by the Protestant Reformers has proven to be a real eye-opener and a tremendous blessing to my own mind and heart. The enrichment received with regard to my doctrinal knowledge and its practical outworking in my Christian life places me in a grateful indebtedness to the editorial staff of <em>Present Truth.</em><br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been on your mailing list for several months, my pastor having recommended <em>Present Truth</em> to me. The articles contained in your magazine have been a constant source of enlightenment and guidance to me. I was particularly impressed with your brochure, &quot;<a href="../Tracts/victory.htm" target="_blank">How to Live the Victorious Life</a>,&quot; which I have shown to a number of our Youth Fellowship.<br>

    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don't care to read <em>Present Truth</em> any more. A sister in the Lord said a while back that it is like dropping back from the eighth grade to kindergarten. After one has been justified by faith, he doesn't turn around and begin examining this. Faith in our God and His Christ presses on to glory and the victor's crown.<br>
    
    <br>
    
Those who keep on whacking away with the Word start to doubt it themselves; and we who read their articles see the error involved, but they don't know it. They know theology, but do they know the Saviour? Those who know Jesus are talking of His soon return and the rapture, and they are not of the holiness movement either.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is so much good about <em>Present Truth</em>, and yet it is so unbalanced. The Reformers I truly admire, and yet they were mainly very unclear concerning Israel's future and the glorious and enlightening dispensational truths of the Word. All your wasted space on the content of the gospel makes me feel very sorry for you.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you for the work that you are doing in helping to clarify issues. Much of what you are writing I have been saying for years, but you are saying it more precisely. With the charismatic movement dividing unrightly the Word of truth, it is refreshing to see your stand. Also, with the charismatics dividing our Protestant churches and sometimes taking over traditional non-Pentecostal churches with a divisive spirit, I am glad to see your magazine.<br>
      <br>
  I think that once in a while you overstate. The Pentecostals who are personal friends of mine seem to have a strong understanding of the doctrine of justification by faith in regards to salvation. It is from that point on where I have my disagreements with them; and let us not forget that the different Pentecostal churches have their different understandings of all these teachings which they generally accept.<br>

    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am an &quot;ex-Pentecostal&quot; and very interested in what you have to say about that movement and its relation to the type of justification advocated by Luther. I am doing a study of Romans, using F. F. Bruce's commentary on the book, and am realizing profound differences in &quot;justification doctrine&quot; between Pentecostals and non-Pentecostals.<br>
    
    <br>
      I had a very profound conversion and a year later got involved in a Pentecostal church and stayed there for about two and one-half years. Then (I believe) God began drawing me back to a noncharismatic faith. There are too many deep differences between the two for me to be satisfied that we are indeed &quot;one in the Spirit.&quot;<br>
    
    <br>
      I have been &quot;baptized in the Holy Spirit&quot; and have spoken in &quot;<a href="../Judgment/39.html" target="_blank">tongues</a>&quot; but am energetically re-evaluating the experience in light of Scripture.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your negative attitude toward Roman Catholics and charismatics has always disturbed me. Jesus Christ loves Catholics and charismatics as much as He loves you and me. Why do you waste time, effort, money and talent on negative ideas?<br>

    </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been a Christian for about four years now, an offspring of the &quot;Jesus Revolution.&quot; For the major part of those four years I have been seeking one experience after another in order to keep a spiritual &quot;high.&quot; In living like this I had become very frustrated.<br>
    
    <br>
    
Not too long ago I was introduced to your magazine. The truth of the gospel (Christ's life, death, resurrection and ascension) was presented by you in a way I had never heard before. My focus of attention has now gone from myself to Christ.<br>
    
<br>
    
I thank God for your magazine. It has given me an objective view of Christ&mdash;something I had never even considered a year ago. I join you in the hope of a New Reformation which, by the grace of God, will unite believers without compromising on the clear teachings of Scripture.<br>
