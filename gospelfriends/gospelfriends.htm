      <p class="style1"><strong><strong><span class="style1  style3"><img src="../aof/images/aofap/aofap22.jpg" width="449" height="358" align="right"></span></strong></strong>Can't find a local sabbath-keeping Christian church where the true gospel is taught in all its fullness? Here is a suggested simple informal outline to follow so that you can conduct a fellowship group in your home!</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="style1"> <strong>1.</strong> Friendly welcome to all by the moderator. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>2.</strong> Moderator or a volunteer from the group to offer the opening prayer to invite the presence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p class="style1"> <strong>3.</strong>  Moderator asks a volunteer from the group to read the <span class="style10"><strong><a href="#Statement_of_Purpose">Statement of Purpose</a></strong></span>. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>4. </strong>Moderator or a volunteer from the group to read the <span class="style12"><strong><a href="#Statement_of_Gospel">Statement of the Gospel</a></strong></span> . </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>5.</strong> Sacred hymns sung by the group for approximately 15 minutes. (the song leader might ask members for favorite hymn selections. Someone who can play the piano or a synthesizer is nice to have). </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>6.</strong> Moderator asks the group members if anyone has a short message to give or paper to read (five minutes normal time limit, ten minutes by special request to extend time.) Followed by brief question and answer period if necessary. Limit possibly to two or three such messages. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>7. </strong>Open with prayer and then begin the group study and open discussion of the word of God, each taking turns in reading a chapter. (A mutually agreed upon time limit might be set at the beginning of the study). </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>8. </strong>Sacred hymn sung by all or special music by a gifted individual.</p>
        <p class="style1"><strong><strong><img src="../aof/images/aofp16.jpg" width="450" height="358" align="right"></strong>9.</strong> Observance of the <strong>Lord's Supper</strong>. Reverently distribute the bread and grape juice of the communion meal to the group. Read appropriate Bible texts, pray over the communion meal and partake of each emblem of the Lord. </p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>10.</strong> Closing hymn and prayer by the moderator.</p>
        <p class="style1"><strong>11. </strong>(Optional) Have a fellowship pot luck lunch or dinner. An afternoon walk or or some other Sabbath activity might be planned. Be sure to take some <a href="../Tracts/index.htm" target="_blank"><strong>gospel tracts</strong></a> with you to give out which have your group's name, address, and email or phone number on them with an invitation to join in your fellowship group (pray to win others to Christ). Also the afternoon is a good time to <strong>baptize new believers</strong> in Christ who have expressed a desire to trust Christ as their Savior and Lord. (If any in your group have a swimming pool or if there is lake or river in your area this can be a wonderful day of baptism celebration, fellowship, and public testimony to the gospel of Christ.)</p>

            <br>
    Because of His infinite <a href="../verses-noframes/love.htm" target="_blank">love</a> for the fallen sons and daughters of Adam, <a href="../verses-noframes/god_himself.htm" target="_blank">God Himself</a> in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ has come into this <a href="../verses-noframes/sin_darkened.htm" target="_blank">sin darkened world</a>, lived a <a href="../verses-noframes/spotless_sinless.htm" target="_blank">sinless spotless life</a> by perfectly obeying and <a href="../verses-noframes/fulfilling_law.htm" target="_blank">fulfilling the Law of God</a>.

    <br>
    Our Lord Jesus Christ was reckoned and treated as a sinner in the eyes of Divine justice so that by God's unmerited <a href="../verses-noframes/grace1.htm" target="_blank">grace</a> alone, <a href="../verses-noframes/in_christ.htm" target="_blank">in Christ</a> alone, atonement and redemption and reconciliation have been accomplished for us all.

He then <a href="../verses-noframes/ascended_into_heaven.htm" target="_blank">ascended into Heaven</a> where He ever lives to make intercession for us as the one and only mediator between God and Man. <br>
    <br>
    All who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in repentance for their sins are <a href="../verses-noframes/justification.htm" target="_blank">justified freely</a> by God's <a href="../verses-noframes/grace.htm" target="_blank">unmerited grace </a>through faith in His sinless life and atoning death.
